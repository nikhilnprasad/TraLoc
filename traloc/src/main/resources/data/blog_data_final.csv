In this edition, we give you S. Bedford, author of It’s Only the Himalayas and Other Tales of Miscalculation from an Overconfident Backpacker. When my best friend and I set out on a round-the-world trip, I expected what I thought to be the quintessential backpacker experiences. Being awed into humility before the rose gold hue of the Taj Mahal at sunset, for example. Or discovering tranquility in the Popsicle blue waves in Loh Dalam Bay. Or even “finding myself” in that ambiguous sense while gaping at the tremendous mountain-scape surrounding Annapurna Basecamp.       In fact, we spent more time dodging guys with one hand on their camera phones and the other on their trouser crotches than admiring India’s most celebrated tomb, and Koh Phi Phi’s Popsicle blue waves were undulating reminders of the way-too-many cocktails I’d imbibed the night before. As for what happened in the Nepali Himalayas… well, I didn’t so much find myself as I did have my ass handed to me. Here are three of the craziest, most unexpected moments that occurred during my year abroad. Lonely Planet didn’t warn me about any of this… At Taj Mahal WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Getting Chased by Lions in Zimbabwe 2. Starring in a Bollywood Commercial for Men’s Underwear 3. Battling My 2 Worst Enemies on a Mountaintop like a Japanese Cartoon Character Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Getting Chased by Lions in Zimbabwe The African jungle teems with an endless succession of fanged and clawed carnivores each more eager than the last to devour your face. There are baboons who’ll throw their poo before going for your eyes; elephants who’ll mash you into pulpy hash-browns; and hippos who’ll… drown you? Squish you? Admittedly, I’m not sure how something resembling a hybrid between a giant pig and an upturned bathtub can be one of the deadliest animals in Africa, but the mystery certainly adds to its formidableness. Africa There was one rule at the hostel outside Victoria Falls: do not leave the compound. I was completely prepared to adhere… until I discovered my bed was full of ants and was forced to bunk with our drunk-on-adrenaline-and-also-beer safari guide. After listening to incredible tales of adventure in the wilderness, I was finally seduced into sneaking out into the screeching, blood-lusting night to fodder my own story. Ten minutes later, I was surrounded by locked eyes and smacking chops, and found myself wondering: If I poo myself, should I throw it?   2. Starring in a Bollywood Commercial for Men’s Underwear Kerala, India I’ve never had the longing to become a famous actor, but I have always wanted to hang with beautiful men, even if they have abdominal lines by Cover Girl and the charming finesse of a durian fruit. Therefore, when I glimpsed a commercial being filmed while sunbathing on Varkala Beach in southern Kerala, I couldn’t resist saying hello to the actors clad in the tightest of whities. But not before I squeezed into my tiniest shorts and most uplifting bikini—hey, I needed something to set myself apart from their female costar, who resembled a sexy deer. Unfortunately, my plan worked a little too well. In addition to catching the eye of the paunch-bellied director who immediately cast me as “cheering white girl number two” (second to my best friend, whose cleavage is way better), I became the object of desire for the one actor who wasn’t also a model. Rather, he was the 40-year-old crispy-haired villain with the determination of Wayne Campbell from Wayne’s World. Anybody know the Hindi translation for, “She will be mine, oh yes, she will be mine”?   3. Battling My 2 Worst Enemies on a Mountaintop like a Japanese Cartoon Character There’s a Gary Larson comic depicting history’s paramount underestimations. It shows the cowboys at Little Big Horn saying, “Indians shmindians” and woolly mammoths saying, “Neanderthals shmeanderthals,” amongst others. Could I add a personal addendum, it’d feature yours truly with the constitution of a shelled mollusk dressed in lumpy jeans and old mittens scoffing at our trekking leader: “Himalayas shimalayas.” (Actually, the line was, “It’s only the Himalayas,” but I digress.) Annapurna Annapurna Basecamp with Dad My two greatest nemeses are cold weather and physical exercise—which you’d think would have dissuaded me from attempting one of the most notorious mountain treks on earth. But I’m also easily lured by notions of achievement (basking in it after the fact, that is, not actually doing it), which is why I undertook the daunting task despite zero training or proper gear. It must be a hereditary trait as my sexagenarian father who breaks a sweat crossing a parking lot accompanied me. Two brain-wrenching, gut-terrorizing, muscle-mincing, heart-rattling weeks later, I understood why the words “only” and “Himalayas” should never share a sentence. Of course, during my travels I likewise had many beautiful experiences that rendered me overwhelmed with gratitude for life—but who wants to read about that? Besides, it’s the awkward, embarrassing, crazy moments and how you handle them that shape you. Spoiler alert: I never did find myself. And thank goodness for that, because then I wouldn’t have a reason to do it all again someday. S.

"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2018/01/places-to-visit-in-morocco-visa-free/,africa,"8 Places to Visit Back in 2016, we were invited to speak at the World Tourism Forum in Istanbul. As soon as we got the invitation, we knew we would take advantage of the opportunity to also explore nearby destinations. We swept everything off the table, laid a map (yes, we still own one and we like things old-school sometimes), and looked for possible detours. The plan was to see Greece, Malta, and Italy after the forum. But you know what they say, some plans are meant to be just that, plans.       I don’t remember what happened, but before we knew it, we had run out of time to secure a Schengen visa. Panicking, we consulted that map again and looked for alternatives. Almost every nearby country requires a visa for Filipino citizens. Georgia and Armenia would be great, but we were saving them for another trip. We were about to lose hope when we found something shining on the Western edge of the Mediterranean — Morocco. Morocco has always sat on top of our list of dream destinations, but we didn’t realize that it’s visa-free for Filipinos. In fact, nationals of over 70 countries and territories can enter Morocco without a visa. Most — like the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and all the member states of the European Union — can stay for up to 90 days. Singapore passport-holders can stay for up to 30 days. Here’s a quick snapshot of the Wikipedia list. This generous visa policy makes Morocco an ideal holiday destination. But here are 10 cities and towns you should consider for your dream Moroccan getaway.   1. Marrakesh Jamaa el Fna in Marrakech The epicenter of Morocco’s tourism, Marrakesh (or Marrakech) is popular for a reason. It’s wild and chaotic, but it’s also unique and so in touch with its past. Stay in a “riad”, the traditional Moroccan house with a courtyard, in its labyrinthine medina and check out the souks in its central plaza called Jemaa El Fna. Marrakesh can be overwhelming (if not intimidating) at first. Its layout is confusing and there are scams here and there. But it didn’t take long before our appreciation of it took root in our hearts and grew so huge that we didn’t want to leave. Situated north of the southern foothills of the Atlas Mountains, its central location makes it an ideal jumpoff point for other destinations like Medina, Casablanca, and Essaouira. Speaking of Essaouira…   2. Essaouira This is me hiding in one of the turrets atop Skala du Port. Walled medina in the background. Although along Morocco’s Atlantic coast, Essaouira looks more like a Mediterranean town with a North African attitude. The citadel is predominantly white, rising from a rocky shore, accented by cerulean boats. Gelato shops mark some corners, and European restaurants punctuate some streets. Yet, a walk is impossible without running into locals clad in djellabas and being treated to the aroma of cumin-mixed tagines. And while it is home to multiple ethnic groups, it is distinctly, undeniably Moroccan. Essaouira means “little rampart,” referring to the walls that surround the area. The fortress was built under the command of the Portuguese. Called by its old name Mogador at the time, Essaouira was one of the six Moroccan towns that the Portuguese seized and ruled. It is a great example of an 18th century fortified port city.   3. Chefchaouen Morocco’s famed blue city! Chefchaouen is best known for the blue-washed buildings that make it one of the most picturesque destinations in the country. Islamic and Andalusian architecture take centerstage here, if not overshadowed by the surrounding Rif Mountains.   4. Casablanca For many tourists, Casablanca rings a bell for the romantic Hollywood classic named after it. But the city itself stands on its own as a compelling tourist destination. Its most iconic structure is the impressive and enormous Hassan II Mosque and its minaret, the tallest in the world. Don’t leave the city without stopping at the Medina and the Corniche.   5. Tangier A post shared by Sydney (@sydney_btravels) on Jan 6, 2018 at 2:06pm PST Everywhere we went in Morocco, locals urge us to see Tangier on the Gibraltar Strait coast. This northern city has a very different character, having been the primary gateway to Africa for Europeans for centuries and a place where influences blend to create a distinct culture.   6. Fez A post shared by Felipe Cheik (@felipe_cheik) on Jan 7, 2018 at 3:39am PST Fez is Morocco’s second largest city, but it also cradles the world’s largest urban pedestrian (car-free) zone, Fes el Bali. Fes el Bali is one of its two medinas and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Also located here is the University of al-Qarawiyyin, “the oldest existing, continually operating university in the world” as recognized by both UNESCO and Guinness World Records.   7. Ouarzazate and Aït Benhaddou Aït-Ben-Haddou IRL. You might recognize Ouarzazate as the filming location for a lot of Hollywood movies: Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), and Prince of Persia (2010) among others. But in the Game of Thrones world, a nearby kasbah, Aït-Ben-Haddou is Yunkai, aka Yellow City and one of the three great city-states in Slaver’s Bay. For domestic and international tourists, it is also the jump off point for the Draa Valley and into the desert.   8. Merzouga A post shared by Sara Ramundo (@la.sara.mundo) on Jan 7, 2018 at 2:43am PST If you see photos of Morocco depicting endless sand dunes and camel rides, chances are their photographers once stayed in Merzouga. Situated on the edge of the Sahara, it is a tiny village best known for its proximity to Erg Chebbi, a Saharan erg.

Our driver dropped us off where the road almost meets the sea, and just left us there with no explanation, no suggestion on where to go or what to do, no fcks at all. I looked at my equally confused co-visitors and let out a gentle laugh. We all thought we signed up for a tour. Apparently, what they meant for tour was simply a ride. For a brief moment there, I doubted whether we were in the right city. Although along Morocco’s Atlantic coast, Essaouira looks more like a Mediterranean town with a North African attitude. The citadel is predominantly white, rising from a rocky shore, accented by cerulean boats. Gelato shops mark some corners, and European restaurants punctuate some streets. Yet, a walk is impossible without running into locals clad in djellabas and being treated to the aroma of cumin-mixed tagines. And while it is home to multiple ethnic groups, it is distinctly, undeniably Moroccan.       “So where do we go?” said one of the Londoners in our group. Shrugs were our response. It wasn’t really a problem. Essaouira is quite small, and many of the key attractions are within a few minutes’ walk. Some of us followed the crowd to the beach. Some followed the walls to the medina. But we followed the irresistible scent of grilled fish, which led us exactly to the place we wish to visit in this side of Morocco — the ramparts. Me having a photo op with the medina in the background Vins having his turn.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Essaouira Ramparts and Skala du Port Essaouira means “little rampart,” referring to the walls that surround the area. The fortress was built under the command of the Portuguese. Called by its old name Mogador at the time, Essaouira was one of the six Moroccan towns that the Portuguese seized and ruled. It is a great example of an 18th century fortified port city. The port area appears to retain its old charms. Many of the original canons remain in place, adorning the bulwarks. Its bastions are still standing. And its signature blue boats are docked at its feet. This ancient vibe is what has allowed the city to penetrate pop culture, having been chosen as locations for Orson Welles’s Othello and, more recently, HBO’s Game of Thrones. Yep! Essaouira is actually where most scenes in Astapor was shot, including the unforgettable and iconic scene wherein Daenerys Targaryen bought and freed the Unsullied. Dracarys! At the center of it all is Skala du Port, a square tower crowned with a turret in each corner and flanked by circular bastions. It is from the top of this tower that postcard-worthy views of the walled medina are best enjoyed while also dodging a flurry of seagulls that fly past and above it.

Walled medina in the background. Entrance fee: MAD10   Food Trip at the Fish Market Just down by the harbor lies a fish market that has become popular among tourists. Essaouira is a coastal city, which makes seafood a major part of the local diet and a must-try for visitors. Purchase their freshest catch at the market (per pack or kilo), have it grilled in one of the adjacent stands, and dine outside. It’s not much (especially knowing that it’s actually a bit more expensive here) but having lunch in the middle of blue boats can be quite a unique experience. Dining out! If your tastebuds aren’t itching for seafood, head over to one of the many restaurants in the medina.   Shopping at Medina Inscribed to UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 2011, Essaouira’s walled medina is incredibly well-preserved. A walk down any of its streets is a walk back in time. Its inner alleys are lined with whitewashed houses bearing colorful doors. Every block has a restaurant serving its own Moroccan, French, or Italian specialties, and vibrant souks selling dresses, slippers, souvenirs, and Berber carpets. It’s not as labyrinthine as the medina in Marrakech so a stroll around here is more inspiring than confusing. Essaouira Medina Beef Couscous at one of the restaurants in medina Seagull Overhead. Essaouira Medina Entrance Fee: FREE.   Gnaoua World Music Festival If you’re visiting Essaouira in May, don’t miss the Gnaoua World Music Festival, an annual event that showcases the music of foreign and mystical Gnaoua artists over four days. Over 500,000 people flock to the city and many performances are open to the public for free.   Sidi Mohamad Ben Abdellah Museum Named after the founder of the modern-day Essaouira, this gorgeously refurbished museum narrates the history of the city though numerous artifacts — pottery, jewelry, carpets, weapons, costumes — all housed in a 19th century mansion. Entrance Fee: MAD 10 Beach Walk Adjacent to the ramparts is a long stretch of beige to golden sand that laps up the restlessness of the Atlantic. To say it’s completely relaxing can be misleading as the wind can be strong and the waves turbulent. It may not be welcoming to casual swimmers, but it has become a haven for the more adventurous ones, particularly those who enjoy watersports. Kitesurfers and windsurfers add a lot of energy to what many consider the favorite hangout place for Essaouirans. Walk farther from the town end and you’ll find horse and camel rentals. Their owners will be following you around and insisting that you go on a ride, but just say no politely (and patiently) if you’re not interested. That’s a looooong beach. Entrance Fee: FREE.   The Village of Diabat Keep walking and you’ll find the Bordj El Berod, ruins of a watchtower half-buried in the sand. Legend has it that this was the inspiration for “Castles Made of Sand,” a song written and recorded by Jimi Hendrix, an American rock icon (in case you’re not familiar like some people, ahem ahem) and somewhat a local hero. Even farther is the Berber village of Diabat, located 3-5km south of medina and is accessible by taxi or on foot (if you have the time and the stamina). Here you can enjoy horse treks or horse rides around Essaouira, an interesting way of exploring the city. Zouina-cheval, a tour operator, offers rides for old-timers and beginners alike (even children). Rates are steep though, around MAD 160 per hour.   Goats on Argan Trees This is not actually in Essaouira but on the way there from Marrakech. Apparently, in this part of the world, goats can climb trees. I didn’t know they were realize until I noticed one of them move. I was like, “You did not, you goatee!” Goats on Argan Trees Goats on Argan Trees Food is so scarce that they have learned to rummage through Argan trees for their berries. And some locals have learned to turn curiosity into money. They would intentionally display the goats perched on the branches of trees just along the road. They charge for taking photos and holding one of the superstar goats. Argan trees are useful to locals. Its berries contain seeds from which argan oil is extracted. This oil is popular in Europe and is believed to be of higher quality than olive oil. I’ve never tried it, really, but there are a lot of argan oil shops in Essaouira, Marrakech, and even Casablanca. "https://hippie-inheels.com/best-of-albania/,albania,"Best of Albania From a Local: Beaches, Bars, and UNESCO sites This will contain a guest post from the wonderful Bena Mero, who was my tiny little superhero in Albania; she will let us in on the best of Albania, from a local’s viewpoint.  After leaving Corfu Island drunk as can be, and taking a very sickening ferry ride, Megan and I were in Albania. I usually keep close tabs with my parents while traveling, but decided I shouldn’t update them on this stop. For some reason they’d made me swear not to go there. In Barcelona while couchsurfing , two different hosts warned us not to head to Albania. A guy on a train told us we’d be “asking to be kidnapped” as “no girl who gets on a train in Albania gets off on her own”. We were told we would absolutely be sold into a sex slavery ring. Well, it was cheaper to get to Croatia through Albania, and when you’re on a budget that sort of becomes the main decision maker, not safety. A girl on the ferry, Bena, told us she was headed to Tirana , the capital, by bus and to go with her. She would help us get to Montenegro. We stayed with her at her dad’s house, went out to a couple bars, and then got a mini bus to head out. We switched rides from car to car throughout Albania, Montenegro, and finally Croatia. My regret wasn’t going somewhere unsafe, hitchhiking for 2 days, having nowhere to sleep, nor any correct currency to buy food and water… my regret was not having time to stay in Albania with Bena. The one night we were there showed a side of Albania that we were not told about. It seemed to be a modern, fun, and safe place to explore. Bena, has graciously given Hippie in Heels some tips on what to see in Albania! The Best of Albania from a local Sightseeing &amp; Nature   There are two don’t miss archaeological sights; one Durres is near the port, and the other, Butrint is near Ksamili in Saranda. You can see the Kruja Castle and museum of their National hero, Skenderbej: Kalaja e Krujes dhe Muzeumi i Skenerbeut . Want to see another castle? No problem. Kalaja e Rosafes (Rosafa castle) in Shkoder is amazing! Archeological site, Durres  via flickr  Butrint, the other main archeological site, via flickr  view from the Kruja Castle on flickr Between Gjirokaster and Saranda. Syri i kalter is a beautiful fresh water spring with stunning blue and green color. How about a visit to a small village to see how locals really live? Thethi , a village in the mountains of Northern Albania. A 4×4 vehicle is required to get there, but it is beautiful. The villagers have rooms set up for visitors and make home cooked food, which they grown.. If hiking is your thing, this is a great place to visit.  Another beautiful large lake, Valbona, near the border with Macedonia is a easy to get to by ferry. Syri i kalter on flickr Valbona Lake on flickr Eating &amp; Nightlife Piceri Era, Tirana Piceri Era (Tirana) is my favorite restaurant in Tirana. Everything is amazing.  Liro’s Hotel (Vlore) has good food and lots of water sports/activities, located on the edge of a cliff and right by the water. Other great restaurants are Sofra e Ariut (Dhermi) and Beer House (Saranda). Three great bars to check out are Sky (Golem), Folie (Tirane), and Mumia (Tirane). Sand Beaches (Adriatic Sea) worth a visit: Velipoje, Shengjin, Golem, Vlore Velipoje White Rock Beaches (Ion Sea) you must see: Dhermi, Jale, Himare, Ksamili — small island beaches near Saranda Himare beach on flickr There are three UNESCO Heritage sites They are the cities: Berati, Gjirokastra, and Kruja (where the castle is mentioned above).

Every Sunday, this spot will feature a new travel blogger. Some weeks it will be a really fun  interview about packing, fashion, and fitness  so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it’ll be a  detailed   luxury guide  to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.  E-mail me if you’d like to be featured. A Luxury Guide to Buenos Aires Tell us a little about Buenos Aires and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel there. Because of Argentina’s volatile economic system, the American dollar (typically) goes extremely far. This means that you can live like a queen on very little. When I lived in Buenos Aires for a year as a study abroad student, I lived it up. I ate at fantastic restaurants that foodies everywhere would die for, went out to the most exclusive bars with my Argentine and expat friends, and enjoyed spa services – nails and waxing alike – at ridiculously low prices. This is a “bougie on a budget” traveler’s heaven (as long as the exchange rate and inflation are working in your favor when you go). What makes Buenos Aires a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Imagine waking up to medialunas (croissants) and coffee at a quaint, European coffee shop situated in an ivy-covered garden. Spend your day walking around exquisite neoclassical French architecture through the neighborhood of Recoleta. Stop for lunch at a patio in trendy Palermo and spend your dollars at the many luxury high-fashion boutique shops, like Maria Cher. Enjoy the juiciest steak of your life at La Cabrera with a glass of Malbec. Dance the night away at the socialite river-front club Asia de Cuba on Puerto Madero. If that’s not glamorous, I don’t know what is. (source) Of all of the 5 star, which is the best in your town? There are many 5-stars in Buenos Aires, as very few cities does luxury like Buenos Aires. But, the most famous for design lovers of the world is the Faen a Hotel . Even if you’re not able to stay at this 5-star, head here for a cocktail in the all-white room and wander to admire this work of art. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? Buenos Aires is a big city, so you can find almost anything here. For our travelers who want to see what makes Buenos Aires so special, go to the San Telmo festival on Sunday. It’s full of street art, great food and incredible people watching. Or, head to the famous Recoleta cemetery – the most expensive property in the world, to hang out with some dead rich people. Where are the best hang outs during the day? Buenos Aires is definitely a café and park-culture type of city. You can spend the day people-watching and sipping yerba mate in the parks . Or you can take a coffee with a friend at one of the many – MANY- coffee shops in the city.  The city is brimming with festivals on the weekends. On Saturdays, the main parks in Recoleta and Palermo are the places to be while the San Telmo Sunday festival (in my humble opinion) is the best in the world. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Buenos Aires and what are their best dishes? There are so many “ best restaurants in Buenos Aires ” that it’s hard to pick!. Go to La Cabrera and order the lomo. Head to Il Ballo del Mattone and gorge on any of the homemade pastas.  Mix it up from the Italian influence and scarf some Mediterranean at the famous Sarkis or sushi at Nikkai. Finally, for a truly authentic, gourmet and unique Argentine experience, go to Café San Juan in San Telmo. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Buenos Aires is a GELATO heaven. Since about 75% of the city’s residents (portenos) are of Italian descent, you can find this Italian specialty on every corner. Volta, Persicco and Freddo are all BsAs staples for gelato. You also cannot leave the city without eating alfajores – sugar cookies with dulce de leche (a caramel-esque sauce) in the middle. You can get them at any bakery! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? While Alto Palermo, the major mall in Buenos Aires, carries every designer, I’m not much of a mall person. I’d rather wander a small neighborhood and go in and out of boutiques while sitting for a coffee or glass of wine in between. Go to Palermo Soho and shop around at the best – Maria Cher, Jasmin Chebar, Las Pepas. Do not leave Buenos Aires without a colorful leather jacket from Las Pepas and make sure you stop in Plaza Dorrego to have a snack and to pop into the up-and-coming indoor designer markets surrounding the plaza.   Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? The sunsets over the river front in the Puerto Madero neighborhood are magical. Take a stroll down the boardwalk around sunset and make sure to admire the incredible “Puente de Mujer” or the Woman’s Bridge. There are endless restaurants with outdoor patios for you to relax with a cocktail while watching the sun go down. If you have the time, take a little trip to romantic cobblestoned Colonia, Uruguay for the sunset. (source) Now the the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Buenos Aires comes alive at night. A normal dinner-time reservation is no earlier than 8:00p (that’s the early bird special) and most twenty-something’s are eating at around 10:00p. An 11:00p reservation is not uncommon. That being said, bars don’t really open up until 12:00p and clubs don’t get going until 2:00p. You can rage until the early hours. There were many mornings at 6:00a where I’d begin to see the sunrise from the bar windows and immediately jump in a cab home to get to bed! One of my favorite places to get started at is Milion in Recoleta. Nested in an old mansion, the cocktails are divine and makes you feel like you’re at a Gatsby-style house party. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? There is a true club culture in Buenos Aires. If you like to dance until the wee hours, you have many options. I did love the upscale Asia de Cuba just a little too much and spent my life’s savings on champagne and tequila at this hotspot. Word of advice? Go with an Argentine or don’t open your mouth (if you don’t speak Spanish) when you’re trying to get in. They try to keep this place tailored to upscale locals! If you’re really feeling like a wild night – go to Club 69 at Niceto Club on Thursdays. "https://hippie-inheels.com/all-about-lake-sevan-in-armenia/,armenia,"All About Lake Sevan in Armenia Armenia remains one of the most underrated travel destinations in the Caucasus region and the unbelievably blue, sparkling Lake Sevan its star attraction. Lake Sevan is a popular destination for Armenians who tend to spend their hot summers in the area enjoying the sandy beaches and cool waters. Elsewhere, in the more remote parts of the country, winding roads surrounded by snow-topped mountains lead up to spectacular, lonely monasteries set in some breath-taking scenic locations where meeting other tourists or travelers is a rarity. But not here. The lonely winding roads of Armenia With Lake Sevan taking up over 5% of Armenia’s surface, there’s quite a lot happening around its extensive shores. A little peninsula, which was once an island, is home to a 9 th century Armenian church called Sevanavank whilst the curious Noratus cemetery and solitary Hayravank monastery are close by. Getting to Lake Sevan The best way in which to get around in Armenia is by driving a rental car, which can be hired in Yerevan. We were actually on a road trip around both Georgia  and Armenia so we rented our car in Tbilisi, Georgia and crossed the border into Armenia with it. You can easily include a stay in Lake Sevan on your way to Yerevan from the border or on the way back. If you intend doing this, be aware that you will need to buy extra car insurance just after crossing the border into Armenia. Do not pay the first person offering insurance, you can find better deals if you take your time to check out different prices at the shops further down the road. If you are not driving yourself, you can get to Lake Sevan from Yerevan using public transport. Minibuses run from Yerevan to Sevan town quite frequently (travel time about 1 hour) from where you could then get another local bus or a taxi to Lake Sevan. We did not use public transport so we cannot comment about the ease of traveling this way. The possibility definitely exists though! A herd of cows grazing on the banks of Lake Sevan Where to stay in Lake Sevan The western and northern shores of Lake Sevan are home to a wide range of accommodation options. Many of the resorts have beachside cabins with beach access but the mid-range options seemed to be very hit or miss according to the online reviews. Because we were very flexible, we preferred staying a few kilometers out of the area in a little village called Tsakhkunk, which was home to a highly-rated guesthouse, from where we drove the short distance to Lake Sevan every time we wanted to go there. Beachside cabins at Lake Sevan What to do in Lake Sevan The popularity of Lake Sevan is partly due to the easy accessibility of the lake from Yerevan. Whereas many of the other more remote parts of Armenia have very little tourism infrastructure, Lake Sevan is well equipped for tourists, many of whom are local. The most obvious reason to come to Lake Sevan is to get away from the summer heat in other parts of the country. Lake Sevan is a lot cooler than Yerevan being almost twice as high in elevation and hence provides a very refreshing retreat from the capital city which can be both stifling and oppressive during the summer months.   Swim, surf or ski There are a number of water based activities happening around Lake Sevan. You can swim in the cool blue waters of the lake, worship the sun on the public beaches or jet-ski and wind-surf along the lake. Boat rides on the lake are also available if you would like to experience different parts of it.   Fish dinners Dining on Lake Sevan’s fish is a highlight in itself. Excellent fish restaurants line the lake’s shores or you can sample the fresh fish being barbequed right on the beaches. Either way, you’re in for a scrumptious experience! A selection of grilled fish and fish kebabs at one of Lake Sevan’s many fish restaurants Sevanavank Monastery This 9 th -century monastery is actually a two-church complex and is one of the most-visited sites in all of Armenia. The monastery is ancient and well-preserved making it interesting to visit, but the best thing about Sevanavank are the glorious views over the lake. The monastery can be accessed by means of some steep stairs, where little stalls selling drinks and all manner of souvenirs are located. If you’re lucky and the skies are clear, you can expect to get some great photo shots of the churches overlooking the lake. The road to Sevanavank Monastery overlooking Lake Sevan Noratus Cemetery This is by far our favourite attraction around Lake Sevan. Noratus is the largest khachkar cemetery in the world and if you’re wondering what khachkars are, well they are carved memorial stones in which crosses and other motifs are carved. Some of the khachkars in Noratus date back to the 10 th century. Despite it being a very fascinating place, there were few people around when we visited and we mostly shared the space with a flock of sheep who were happily grazing on the grass around the carved stones as their shepherdess looked on. Noratus Cemertey Hayravank Monastery We personally thought that the 10 th century church at Hayravank was more beautiful than that at Sevanavank, probably due its almost “forgotten” feel and the complete lack of tourists around. In fact, there was only a shepherd tending to his livestock whilst a herd of cattle was drinking from the lake water close to monastery at the spot where we stopped for a picture. Hayravank is also home to a few khachkars which are not as grand as those in Noratus. Hayravank Monastery overlooking Lake Sevan If you’re looking to travel off the beaten track, be sure to put Armenia on your bucket list! The country has still not been discovered by mass tourism and offers some wonderful authentic experiences which are difficult to find elsewhere. Spending some time in Lake Sevan, which is more accommodating than the rest of the country in terms of infrastructure, is a good way to end a trip to Armenia!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/06/things-to-do-in-darwin-holidays-itinerary/,australia,"DARWIN ON A BUDGET: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary When Captain John Lort Stokes of the Beagle reached a harbor in Northern Australia in 1839, he thought about a friend and former shipmate who would probably like the area had he been part of the crew — Charles Darwin. Yet, the Darwin himself never set foot in the port city that would later be named in his honor. When asked why the Captain named it after the renowned evolutionist, no one in our group was certain. “Perhaps he saw the many remarkable species that walked the land at the time,” our tour guide theorized. And it could be true. From the white ibis birds that roam the shores to the saltwater crocodiles that rule the rivers, Australia’s biodiversity is quite fascinating, to say the least. Despite its natural beauty, however, Darwin isn’t really the first that comes to mind when we think of Australian cities. It’s the Jon Snow among the Stark children, the Tyrion among the Lannister siblings, the Dorne of the Seven Kingdoms. Isolated. Outcast. Somewhat out of place. It’s laidback when the others are bustling, tropical when others are temperate. Yet, it survives, thrives, and leaves a unique imprint among the lucky souls who would come visit.         WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Darwin Since it was founded in 1869, Darwin has had its ups and downs. The town saw fast prosperity during the gold rush at neighboring Pine Creek that began in 1871, but growth slowed down after decades. Darwin has always been cut off from the rest of Australia, especially before the completion of the Stuart Highway. Darwin is also the first Australian city to be directly attacked by a foreign power. On 19 February 1942, 242 Japanese aircraft led two air raids on the city of Darwin. It was just the beginning of a series of attacks that pushed Australia to widen its participation in World War II. Today, much of what was left after the war has been turned into attractions for thousands and thousands tourists, who have been contributing heavily to the city’s economy. Darwin is the gateway to the natural wonders of what many refer to as the Top End, which is also composed of the Litchfield and Kakadu National Parks, Arnhem Land, and the town of Katherine. Mindil Beach faces west, allowing a fantastic view of the sunset.   When to Visit and What to Wear Darwin enjoys a tropical savanna climate with only two seasons: dry season (May-September) and wet season (October-April). The annual maximum average temperature stays around 32°C (90°F) all year-round. It’s the minimum that varies a little bit: around 24°C in December (the hottest month) and 19°C in July. This means you can pack light because tees and shorts are the most comfortable especially during sunny days. Humidity begins to rise in November and December. Rainfall peaks in January-March. The upside is that this is when the Top End’s natural beauty blooms to the fullest: waterfalls are grander, rivers higher, lands greener, and biodiversity livelier. You might want to throw in waterproof pouches and covers to make sure your gears are protected.   How to Get to Darwin Darwin International Airport is the only one serving the city and the biggest in the Northern Territory. It is directly connected to many of other Australian cities, but only a few international destinations.

More info: 10 FREE or Cheap Things to Do in Darwin   How to Get Around Darwin An AAT Kings mini-bus If you’re visiting a spot within the downtown area, you’ll find walking to be a good choice only when the weather conditions are favorable. It might not be a great idea during the wet season and in December, the hottest month. If you’re planning on seeing much of what the city has to offer (including those in the suburbs), it would be wise to pick any of the following options. Bus . Bus fare in the city costs AUD 3, which is good for unlimited bus rides for 3 hours. Unlimited all-day fares are at AUD 7. See more details below. Darwin Bus Fare Table You may check the bus timetable here . Taxi . Standard fare varies depending on the day and time. Rates are a bit higher during weekends and in the evening. See table below. As of June 2016 Note that cabs are ideal for downtown and suburbs trips only. Don’t take a cab to Litchfield or Kakadu. Unless you’re extremely wealthy. LOL. Car Rental . If you’re a group, renting a car is the best way to see the city because key attractions are actually far apart. Usual rates are around AUD 77 for a Toyota Yaris with a 100km/day limit, and around AUD 130 for an unlimited mileage arrangement. Make sure you read all the terms and conditions before signing any contract. Car Rental is also a great option for exploring the national parks (if you’re part of a group). Group Tour . If you are not interested in driving, you may join a group tour, which usually includes a tour guide and lunch.   Other Tips for the Poor Traveler Choose a hostel with a kitchen . There are a lot of dining options in Darwin, but meals are generally expensive. To give you an idea, a decent meal at a budget restaurant costs AUD 15-20 on the average and soda in can is at AUD 4. If you’re staying at a hostel with a kitchen open to guests, you can simply buy ingredients from the supermarket and cook for yourself. It’s your cheapest bet. Tour lunch is usually composed of cold cuts, salad, and beets. . If that’s not your thing, best to buy food (a sandwich or something) before the trip. Wear comfortable hiking shoes . If you plan on exploring the sites, know that there might be a lot of trekking and a bit of climbing. A good pair will make your trip more enjoyable. If you’re joining a Litchfield tour, bring extra clothes because there are swimming/dipping spots. There are plenty of currency exchange places in Darwin. It shouldn’t be a problem. Tipping isn’t obligatory . But if you like the service at the restaurant, 10% should be enough. For the taxis, locals just round off the fare. In case of emergency, call 000. . This will send an ambulance, firefighters, or the police. Be calm and clearly state your exact address.   Sample 5-Day Itinerary The plunge pool at the base of Florence Falls If you have only five days for this trip, here’s a sample basic itinerary. DAY 1 05:10 am: ETA Darwin06:00 am: Check in at YHA Hostel if possible (Drop baggage if not)06:30 am: Explore Bicentennial Park (or rest if checked in)09:00 am: Crocosaurus Cove12:00 pm: Lunch01:00 pm: City Tour07:30 pm: Dinner, sleep DAY 2 Litchfield National Park TourMindil Sunset Market (if Thursday/Saturday of dry season) DAY 3 Kakadu National Park TourDinner, Rest DAY 4 Katherine Gorge and Edith FallsDinner, Rest DAY 5 Check outFlight back to where you came from.   Budget Breakdown To give you an idea on how much the above itinerary will cost you, here’s a breakdown of possible expenses. Note that this list assumes that you’re traveling ALONE and joining a typical group tour instead of renting a car and DIY. This is meant to give you just a ballpark figure. Cost per meal at a restaurant: AUD 15-20 Darwin YHA Hostel (per night): AUD 34.50 Darwin Airport Shuttle: AUD 18 Katherine Gorge Tour: AUD 250 Kakadu Tour: AUD 245 Litchfield Tour: AUD 250 City Tour: AUD 95 You can bring down the cost of your trip significantly if you cook your own food, stay at dorms, and just rent a car.

A Luxury Guide to Queenstown Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Queenstown. I’m Petra, and I’m one half of The Global Couple travel blog (the other half is my husband Shaun). We have travelled to many parts of the world and have settled back in our home country of New Zealand (for now!). Queenstown is in New Zealand’s South Island. We have visited the town many times over the past few years, and we have tried out many luxury options that Queenstown has to offer! What makes Queenstown a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Queenstown has so much to offer luxury-oriented travelers. It’s a pretty expensive city to visit and as New Zealand’s tourism hub many companies catering to the luxury traveler have sprung up. There are 5-star hotels, amazing fine dining restaurants, spas, and many activities to keep you busy. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? We’ve stayed at the Hilton which is about 10 minutes’ drive out of Queenstown, but it is in a lovely setting right next to the lake. They even have jet boats to take you from the hotel to town and back again if you don’t want to drive! What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Blanket Bay , about 45 minutes’ drive from Queenstown in the small town of Glenorchy, is one of New Zealand’s top luxury hotels. It’s got a hefty price tag but from what we hear it’s an incredible place to stay. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? There are so many fun activities to do in Queenstown that it would take forever to list them all! One of the best activities we have done (and highly recommend) is a scenic flight to Milford Sound. The mountainous landscape surrounding Queenstown make it an ideal place to do a scenic flight – the views are just breathtaking. Landing at Milford Sound and doing a boat cruise is like being transported to another world. There are also jet boat tours, and the vineyard scene around Queenstown is great too – there are guided tours so that you can drink and don’t have to drive! Check out this article on 36 hours in Queenstown for more ideas of activities and places to go! Where are the best hang outs during the day? Sitting on the lakefront in a café or bar is one of our favourite things to do in Queenstown. With the mountains all around and a great coffee in hand it’s not hard to feel happy! Queenstown Gardens are right next to the town and are worth a walk around too. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Queenstown and what are their best dishes? We recently visited Madam Woo, on Mall St in Queenstown. This restaurant serves amazing Malaysian fusion food – our favourite dishes were the beef rendang curry and the pork hawker roll – kind of like a Malaysian-style taco! For a more fancy dinner, head to Botswana Butchery on the lakefront. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Patagonia Chocolates on Beach Street has a huge selection of ice cream and gelato, as well as dessert dishes. Their hot chocolate is to die for! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Queenstown? Onsen Hot Pools, about 10 minutes out of Queenstown, have private spa pools overlooking the beautiful Shotover River. You can hire the pools by the hour and you can add on extras like champagne and candles – it’s such a fun and relaxing experience! There are massage and spa services in all the good hotels in Queenstown. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Anywhere along the lake front has beautiful sunset views. You can also catch the Skyline Gondola up to the top of the hill above Queenstown for some excellent views over the town, lake, and surrounding mountains. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. There is a multitude of bars in Queenstown – there are so many travelers around that every night is party night! We love Bardeaux, it’s tucked away down a lane and it serves a wide range of whiskies and other spirits as well as renowned local wine."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2018/03/things-to-do-in-melbourne/,australia,"5 Fantastic Things to Do in Melbourne Melbourne, one of Australia’s most famous city – and rightly so.

Melbourne’s Festivals Queen Victoria Market Astor Theatre Nightlife Yarra Valley Finding the right accommodation in Melbourne Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Melbourne’s Festivals See all the wonders at one of Melbourne’s many festivals . This well-curated arts festival makes its city’s residents experience familiar spaces in all new light. Tourists will find Melbourne’s festivals to be truly festive and exhilarating. Never is this more evident than with the brilliant White Night festival in February, or the famed Comedy Festival every April, the grand Melbourne Fringe in September or Melbourne Festival in October. Queen Victoria Market Go and experience Queen Victoria Market . Sydney has Paddy’s, in Melbourne, it’s the splendid Queen Vic. The open-air Queen Victoria Market is something you won’t see every day, packed with stallholders who are zealous about fresh produce. The market is very popular with locals as their go-to for fruits, vegetables, meat and a fantastic variety of dairy and smallgoods. It has also become a ‘must visit’ for tourists. With a huge number of stalls selling anything from clothes, accessories and others, the markets have grown into more than just the place to get the necessities. Astor Theatre Visit the Astor Theatre and see a classic . The Astor is an Art Deco place that’s been opened back in 1936. It’s, in fact, the last single-screen cinema of its kind in operation in Melbourne. You’ll find beautiful gold curtains framing the screen, plus the entire experience will make you go back to old Hollywood. The theatre offers a program of new and classic films in 35mm, 70mm as well as digital formats, plus it’s a cultural hub for movie fans, with remastered classics, double features, new and independent movies, film festivals and other unique events. Nightlife Get your nightlife on and dance until dawn . Sydneysiders might fight the good fight against the nightlife-crushing lockouts, but you’ll find Melburnians dancing until the small hours nearly every night of the week – no joke. Do yourself a favour and visit one of the many nightclubs while in Melbourne. On a Saturday night, go to Laundry Bar for an awesome hip-hop party, or dance to some old-school disco at the Toff in Town. Check out which Melbourne DJs are playing at Boney, Howler and Ferdydurke if you’ll be outside the city. Yarra Valley Take a day trip to the Yarra Valley . With its serene rolling green hills, swaying vineyards and timeworn farmhouses, it can be easy to forget that the Yarra Valley is less than an hour’s drive from the CBD. You’ll have the time of your life visiting cellar doors of the region’s famous wineries that are open every weekend, and the winery restaurants have become perhaps one of the most sought-after dining destinations here in Melbourne. Our picks are Tarrawarra Estate, Giant Steps and Yering Station, and don’t forget to fill up on some cheese from Yarra Valley Dairy while you’re at it. Finding the right accommodation in Melbourne What better way to rest up after a day’s worth of adventure than to cosy up on a luxurious hotel that fits your wants and budget. There are many awesome accommodations in Melbourne so be sure book one nearest your chosen destinations.

It was one of the first places that the British settled when, in they founded a penal colony there. Today it has a population of just fewer than 5 million, of which approximately one third were born in a country other than Australia, and is always listed among the top cities in the world for tourism.       In 2013, the city received almost half of all the foreign tourists to Australia, which played a major role in helping the city make its $337.45 billion for the year, a figure that is more than some countries make, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Denmark. Although the city makes so much money from tourism, there are still a lot of free, fun things visitors can enjoy whilst they are there. Here is a list of 7 of perhaps the most popular free and fun things to do when visiting the city. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Experience Circular Quay. 2. Visit the Government House and the Royal Botanic Gardens. 3. Enjoy the Old World Charm of The Rocks. 4. Go Underground to Paddington Reservoir Garden. 5. Walk Across Harbour Bridge. 6. Be One of the ‘In Crowd’ at Darling Harbour. 7. Hit Bondi Beach. Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Experience Circular Quay. This is an area of the city that is always alive with activity as it is not just the place from where most of the different ferries leave from but is also the place where access can be afforded to many of the other city attractions like the Opera House and Royal Botanic Gardens, plus beautifully landscaped paths can also take you to the Rocks and Harbour Bridge.   2. Visit the Government House and the Royal Botanic Gardens. You can combine a visit to the spectacular Government House with its ground floor staterooms and upstairs rooms where the Royalty and other heads of state have had their quarters, with a visit to the Royal Botanic Gardens, which the house overlooks and surprisingly, both are free to enter, as is a guided tour of the gardens which house over one million species of plant. There is also a hop on hop off train that runs around the undulating hills that the garden occupies.   3. Enjoy the Old World Charm of The Rocks. The Rocks is located at the foot of the Harbour Bridge and is the oldest part of the city. Visitors are attracted to the Rocks because it houses some very vibrant restaurants, cafes, stalls and shops and is fun to just stroll around them as, the Rocks has been described as an open air museum with buildings dating back to the colonial days.   4. Go Underground to Paddington Reservoir Garden. Built in an old underground water reservoir below the street, the Paddington Reservoir garden contains a hanging garden and an ornamental pool which provides for a somewhat unique, free underground experience.   5. Walk Across Harbour Bridge. Although there is a toll charged for driving across the bridge and a fee for climbing the bridge, you can walk across it for free and thereby take in all the sights that this bridge, which took 6 years to build at a cost that took 62 years to pay for, has to offer. Painting this bridge has become a full time task for many painters, one of which was Paul Hogan before he became better known as “Crocodile Dundee”.   6. Be One of the ‘In Crowd’ at Darling Harbour. Although Darling Harbour used to only be the favorite place to visit by kids as it had a lot of kiddies attractions, according to many travel tips blog , it has now become the hub of attraction for any ‘in Crowd’. With recently added extra attractions added like the Chinese Garden of Friendship, the largest oriental garden of its type outside of Asia, the Sydney Aquarium, an 8 storey high, ultra HD Imax screen and Cockle Bay Wharf with its bustling assortment of both cheap and posh eateries, it has become Sydney’s must see place for most visitors.   7. Hit Bondi Beach. Although, for many, just watching the lifeguards on the beach would be enough fun, on this, one of the world’s most famous beaches, there are a lot of free things to enjoy as well as the view."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-sydney/,australia,"What makes Sydney a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Sydney is by far the most glamorous place to go in Australia. It’s a city of laid back, beautiful people who spend most of their time either at the beach or working on looking good at the beach. It is a haven for budding new chefs to open restaurants of all cuisines. There are boutique hotels, small themed bars, big night clubs, rooftop party places and stunning beaches to recover on. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? The Park Hyatt on the Sydney Harbour has to be the best spot. It has the best view in the city. It sits under the Harbour bridge and looks out over the Sydney Opera House. You can enjoy your breakfast as you watch the city wake up in front of you. Head up to the rooftop for comfortable chase lounges and poolside views of the entire harbour. There’s a fitness center and a spa to make sure you look all the bit a glamorous Sydney-sider before you head out the door. What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? I would definitely send my family and friends to QT Boutique Hotel in the center of Sydney. It’s housed in the historic Gowings and State old theater building. They have worked to retain the theater vibe from the moment you step inside. It feels luxurious while also being fun. All of the furniture is oversized and plush, there are antique pieces of luggage and re-upolstured cloth mannequins awaiting their next costume design. It not only has one of the best spas in Sydney, it was even voted as one of the best new spas in the world by Conde Nast in 2013. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? If you’re looking to do something totally lavish in Sydney, you should hire the Island .   Choose any spot in the harbor to lay atop this luxury barge with 200 of your closest friends. If the price tag is too steep, consider buying a ticket to their weekend parties or hiring a smaller boat to cruise around the harbour.     If you’re a bit more of a thrill seeker, you can always hook yourself to the Harbour Bridge for a clim b . Opt for the sunrise or the sunset walks and watch the colors change across the water. Where are the best hang outs during the day? There isn’t a bad place to hang out in Sydney if you’re by the water. My absolute favorite has to be Cremorne point . Just over the Harbour Bridge to the north sits a grassy hill overlooking the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Get there early on the weekend to get a good, shady spot. You can’t come to Sydney and not go to the beach for the day. Skip the crowded surf beaches of Bondi and Manly and head for the more secluded Balmoral Beach to the north or Milk Beach to the east. Both are better for swimming and sunning. You could easily while away an entire afternoon sitting in a cafe. There is one on almost every corner of every street in the entire metro area. Coffee is a religion here and people are very devout. The best collection of cafes is on Crown Street in Surry Hills where al fresco dining is always on the menu. That and good cappuccino. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Sydney  and what are their best dishes? Sydney is constantly opening new restaurants. One of my favorite chefs in the city is Colin Fassnidge . I saw him butcher a pig at a food festival before showing the audience how to confit it. He believes nothing should be wasted, especially a good piece of pork. Originally from Ireland, he has made Sydney his home, opening two of the best (in my opinion) restaurants in the city. Four in Hand , his first restaurant in Paddington, is full of simple, comforting food done incredibly well. His menu changes monthly in order to source local, fresh produce, but you can never go wrong with anything from a pig. Location: 105 Sutherland St Paddington NSW 2021 His second restaurant, 4Fourteen , is located in Surry Hills. This place is all about sharing. The menu is broken up into “Nibbles”, “Small Plates” and “Large Plates”. The wine list is extensive and all of the wait staff have excellent knowledge of what will go best with your food choice. Again, the menu changes seasonally, but luckily with all of the small plates, you can sample pretty much everything on the menu if you bring enough people. Location: 414 Bourke St. Surry Hills NSW 2010 Entrance via: 72c Fitzroy St. Surry Hills Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Messina Ice Cream is the best ice cream I’ve had outside of Italy. The dark chocolate sorbet was my first love until I tried the creamier versions. The tiramisu is heavenly. They are constantly adding new ones or doing seasonal flavors of the month. They now have several branches around Sydney – Surry Hills, Darlinghurst and the Star Casino. When it comes to dessert in Sydney, Adriano Zumbo is a household name. He’s a regular on Masterchef Australia, famous for challenging the contestants to complete his towering pastry creations. His location at the Star Casino is set up like a sushi train restaurant. Choose wisely.   Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? The main shopping district of central Sydney is at Pitt Street Mall . This pedestrian only street is surrounded by a large Westfield that forms the base of one of Sydney’s more iconic buildings, the Westfield Tower . It’s also home to all of your big name brands. But if you’re looking for local, Australian based designers, head across the street to the Strand . It’s an old arcade style building from the Victorian era and it has kept much of it’s charm. Start at the bottom with a coffee at Strand Espresso to fuel your shopping. Dinasaur Designs make stunningly unique clay jewelry as well as quirky and colorful homeware pieces.  Manning Cartel has quickly become one of Australia’s hottest design houses. Their fabrics are glorious and their designs and patterns can’t be found on the high street. Go to Lover for romantic dresses and gowns and anything lace. If you’re interested in meeting some of the designers in person be sure to shop during one of the year’s many “Evening with the Designers” , generally held at the start of every design season. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? My absolute favorite spot to head for a sunset is Camp Cove , a beach on the South Head of the harbour. It’s really easy to get to by bus and requires only a little bit of walking to reach; trust me, it’s worth it.  You can walk around to a lighthouse and stare out into the Pacific Ocean or look back at the city in the distance. To do it in true Sydney style, pack some snacks and a bottle of wine to enjoy as the sun goes down. If you come at the right time of year and you get lucky, you might even spot some migrating whales.   Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks. There are so many amazing little bars popping up all over Sydney. A few years ago the city center wasn’t the best spot to start a night out, but as licensing laws have begun to slacken, the night life has livened up. If you want somewhere with a view, head to the Glenmore in the rocks . It’s a great alternative to the busier, tourist bars around the Opera House and the view from the rooftop isn’t too bad either. Some of my favorite small bars around the city include Lobo Plantation, a rum bar styled to look like an old American sugar plantation and Since I left You , a tiny little bar with a stone walled courtyard and a long cocktail list. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? The place to see and be seen is definitely the Ivy in the city center. It’s tucked down a side alley, but all you have to do is follow the music (and the line) and you’ll know you’ve arrived. The Ivy is a chic spot for cocktails and dancing. Head down early to sip cocktails by the rooftop pool in summer. If you’re more interested in dancing than looking cute by the bar, head to Marquee in the Star Casino . Popular DJ’s are constantly being featured there. Different nights of the weekend generally play different types of music, so be sure to check up on what’s happening on their website before you head out."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-perth/,australia,"What makes Perth a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Perth apparently has the highest number of self-made millionaires in the world. When the mining boom hit, a demand for luxurious resorts, events, and restaurants followed as people adjusted to a more inflated lifestyle. So, there are a ton of options when it comes to luxury to-dos. What 5 star hotel is the best in Perth ? The Richardson Hotel and Spa is a boutique, five-star hotel near downtown, King’s Park, and the trendy neighborhood of Subiaco. If you’re someone who loves to be in the middle of it all, near public transport and a short drive from the beach, then this is the perfect place for you. The hotel also has a spa, indoor pool, and trendy bars in house. What about boutique hotels in Perth, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Sunmoon Boutique Resort in Scarborough Beach is a cute and reasonably priced hotel in an awesome location. It’s just behind the Rendezvous Hotel, a massive hotel with a little less personality. Both are located right near the beach and walking distance to cafes, organic food shops, boutique shops, and the ocean. It’s the perfect place to be if you’re looking to relax and stay somewhere you won’t have to leave for the duration of your stay. Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Perth? There are so many fun luxurious adventure activities around Perth, it’s crazy. You can join a whale watching tour or take a chartered yacht to Rottnest Island for surfing, scuba diving, and sightseeing. (Think twice about visiting Penguin Island!) Three hours south of Perth is Margaret River, where you can spend half of the day on a gourmet food wine tasting tour, and the other half of the day learning how to surf, kayak, and mountain bike. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Perth? Scarborough Beach has the most to offer with a white sand beach perfect for swimming and lounging, nearby restaurants, and shops. You can easily pack a sarong and spend the day there without getting bored. On the weekends, there are often free salsa dancing lessons or live performances in the amphitheater. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Perth and what are their best dishes? Il Lido is a fantastic Italian restaurant in Cottesloe Beach. A perfect date night includes grabbing a glass of wine and watching the sunset from the Ocean Beach Hotel, and then walking to Il Lido for delicious potato gnocchi. Locals love the ribs and views from Scarborough Beach Bar – personally, I like to go for the pumpkin salad. Coco’s is also a favorite place of mine, an upscale venue in South Perth with views of downtown Perth known for its seafood and prime beef. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Greens and Co. in Leederville is practically synonymous for coffee and cake in Perth. The atmosphere is filled with funky paper lanterns, old posters, cushy couches, and hosts a variety of games. The cakes offered change on a rotating basis, so what you see is what you get! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Perth; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  If you love quirky boutique shops, head to Hillary’s Boat Harbour, a shopping center with unique storefronts set to a backdrop of multimillion dollar yachts. Keep an eye out for sweet swimwear designers like Gypsea, Nu Swimwear, PALM Swimwear, and more. Western Australia is also known for its pearls, which you can pick up at the Kailis store downtown or in Fremantle. Someone to meet is Natalie Rolt, an inspiring local who took her love of fashion first to the marketplace and now has a shop in Fremantle. I’m also obsessed with Lydianne from Coup D’vent , who creates cute purses out of recycled kitesurfing kites. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Perth? Thirty minutes outside of Perth, in a forest, is the Hidden Valley Spa – perfect for relaxing with friends for the day. Also, don’t underestimate the Crown Casino that also has a day spa in house with talented masseuses! Friends also rave about Keturah Spa, a small chain that has locations all throughout Perth. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? If you’re a fan of skylines, be sure to pack a picnic and head to the top of Kings Park for a prime view of the city lights. If you’re more of a beach bunny, opt for taking a picnic down to either Cottesloe or Trigg for stunning views of Western Australia’s cloudscapes that create surreal sunsets. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. For something unique and fun, I love to join a Rivercat Cruise that serves drinks on a small boat that takes you along the Swan River. It’s located in downtown Perth, so once you’re done there, it’s great to head into the city and carry onward. If you end the night at a fancy club in Perth, which one do you head towards? The Brena Bar recently came under fire by having a “No Plebeians” policy, citing it only welcomes people dressed to the nines into its venue. Though that’s not really my style, I always have a great time sipping a few drinks at The Breakwater in Hillarys Boat Harbour, The Crown Perth near Victoria Park, or the Conservatory Rooftop Bar on Murray Street."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-newcastle/,australia,"What makes Newcastle a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Newcastle has the perfect mix of busy and chill. It literally has everything you could want, all within a 10-minute drive. Relaxing beach time, spas, shopping, nice places to eat, nightlife and even adventures like sand dune 4WDing! It is literally YOUR choice what kind of trip you want. Newcastle also boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in Australia, and you’ll have them all to yourself! What 5-star hotel is the best in Newcastle? Crowne Plaza is the best, simply because of the location. It’s right on the iconic Honeysuckle waterfront with gorgeous views to the shipping port. It’s only a few seconds walk to the harbour promenade and 5 mins into the city and main drag. It is also a short 15 min walk to a couple of great beaches. It has all the amenities you could want such as balcony views, a pool and a brilliant restaurant by the water. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? I could go on and an about all the cool things you can do in Newcastle… But here’s a list of my favorites! I love Blackbutt Reserve, a small reserve for an array of interesting Australian animals. Bring a BBQ or a picnic and chill by the duck pond. You can also pat a koala and hand feed the emus! For something adventurous, hire a 4WD and go sand-duning out on Stockton Beach. While you’re there visit Tin City or go shore-fishing. For something a little more luxurious try out Royal Day Spa with pamper packages set in their tranquil environment. They even have private Jacuzzis! For a seriously indulgent day – do a wine tasting tour in the Hunter Valley about 40 mins out of Newcastle. Tours with Tex Tours cost $65 for the whole day and you can buy delicious wines and cheeses at the vineyards. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Newcastle? My favourite weekend hangout includes a late breakfast at either Goldbergs of Three Monkeys on Darby Street then hitting Bar Beach to laze around on the sand. I like Bar Beach the best because there are less people on it, but I also really love the Bogey Hole. In the afternoon I would either walk south to Merewether Beach where there are some great waterfront cafes, or walk to the rock pools at the northern end of Bar Beach to check out the starfish. *Bliss* If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Newcastle and what are their best dishes? Literally, the best and fanciest place to eat is Subo Restaurant . This decadent restaurant ensures a memorable dining experience with a 5-course set menu for $85, which changes every six weeks. The menu boasts dishes such as ‘Broth of blue swimmer crab from Bateau Bay’ and ‘Gippsland oxtail braised in soy and star anise’. If you’re a foodie, this intimate restaurant is everything. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Newcastle; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? For local designers the best place to head to is the boutique stores on Darby Street. One in particular, Guanabana , has made quite a name for herself! Instilled with a penchant for all things exotic, the label fuses ethnic inspiration and bohemian luxe to create standout ranges that compliment the relaxed, free-spirited culture of coastal life. Guanabana is probably Newcastle’s most famous designer. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? There are three memorable places to see the sunset that I can recommend. First, walk along the break wall of Nobby’s Head and around the base of the lighthouse. The whole harbor will light up with pretty colours and illuminate the lighthouse. Secondly, meander along the harbour from Honeysuckle and up to the top of the tower next to Queens Warf Hotel. You’ll see far-reaching views across the city and the harbor from up here. And finally, one not to miss, check out the sunset over Bar Beach and the rolling hills behind from the ANZAC memorial bridge. It’s stunning! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Honeysuckle on the harbor is jammed with all the nicest bars next to each other. Cocktail bars such as Honeysuckle Hotel and MoneyPenny have great views of the coal ships and harbour and awesome relaxing lounge areas to sip your fancy cocktail on."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-hobart/,australia,"What makes Hobart a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Hobart is the vibrant and trendy capital city of Australia’s island state, Tasmania. South of the mainland, Tasmania is home to unparalleled beauty, rugged wilderness, picturesque coastlines, majestic mountains and luxurious vineyards, and at the centre of it all is Hobart. With its picturesque waterfront, exceptional food and wine scene, provocative art movement and Mount Wellington towering above it, Hobart is not only the ideal home base for all your Tasmanian adventures, but a perfect destination for luxury travel. What 5 star hotel is the best in Hobart? You can’t go past the iconic Lenna of Hobart Hotel. Located in the historic neighbourhood of Battery Point, this hotel is a meticulously restored sandstone mansion from the late 1800s and never fails to make me think I’ve stepped onto the filming set of Downton Abbey. It just oozes old world sophistication and charm! The rooms are gorgeous and overlook Salamanca Place and the Hobart waterfront, which is exactly what you want on a trip to Hobart. What about boutique hotels in Hobart, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Islington Hotel ! Snuggled into the foothills of Mount Wellington, the hotel is gorgeous, unique and very luxurious. Every guest room is adorned with fine arts and antiques, but the pi è ce-de-r é sistance in my opinion is the hotel’s immaculate garden, complete with glass pavilion and tranquil reflecting pool. Talk about serene! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Hobart? Where to begin – you’ll be totally spoiled for choice! Some of my favourite escapades (and my recommendations for visitors to Hobart) have been reaching Mount Wellington’s summit, feeding Tasmanian Devils at the conservation park outside Hobart, vineyard hopping through the Southern Wine Route, boating around Bruny Island alongside fur seals, dolphins and whales, gazing awe-struck at MONA’s provocative art installations and stepping back in time to Hobart’s colonial and convict era at Port Arthur. Incredible adventures await in Hobart! You also don’t want to miss the Southern Lights . Where are the best hang outs during the day in Hobart? Again, there are so many great hang outs in Hobart, but you absolutely can’t go past my three favourites: Sullivan’s Cove, Battery Point and Salamanca Place. Sullivan’s Cove is Hobart’s historic waterfront precinct. Wander the picturesque marina, visit Elizabeth Street Pier to indulge in all the food and wine you can handle and take a trip from Brooke Street Pier to MONA. Salamanca Place is the location for the Salamanca Markets held each Saturday. The markets are a true celebration of the sights and sounds of Tasmania, along with its finest produce so are great for wandering, sampling and picking up some local goodies. Every other day, it’s the perfect place to potter away the hours as you hop between cafes, art houses, boutique shops and trendy bars. Last but not least is Battery Point. This idyllic neighborhood is home to cute colonial cottages and my favourite bakery – Jackman and McRoss. Here, you’ll find all the unhealthy stuff. It’s delicious. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Hobart and what are their best dishes? I’m going to pick two of my favourite restaurants at completely opposite ends of the spectrum to cover either a casual or fancy date night. For something a little more casual, you absolutely can’t go past Fish Frenzy at Sullivan’s Cove. The fish and seafood is the freshest and tastiest I’ve ever had and the salads, soup and chips are awesome too. The waterfront location makes it even more perfect and   it’s easy walking distance to the bars at Salamanca after dinner. For a more upscale option, Frogmore Creek Winery is outstanding. The food, beverages and service are impeccable, and the vineyard setting is perfect for the romantics! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Hobart?   Salamanca Place is the shopping mecca for art and antiques. The Saturday morning markets are the place to go if you are after anything local, whether it be food, produce or other goodies. The arcades in the Hobart CBD have a fabulous mix of boutique, independent and chain stores, and the area is so walk-able – you can easily spend all day wandering and getting around on foot, which is always the best way to discover the hidden gems! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Mount Wellington for sure! With its 360 degrees view of the city and the entire surrounding region, the summit is the perfect spot to take in a sunrise or a sunset. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Salamanca Square and Salamanca Place are trendy places to go to socialise, with no shortage of cafes, pubs and bars all within close vicinity to keep you entertained for hours ;) The fun, lively atmosphere and fabulous live music just draws you in! Grape Wine Bar is one of my favourites!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2015/07/free-tourist-attractions-darwin-australia/,australia,"10 FREE or Cheap Things to Do in Darwin, Australia It didn’t take very long for it to dawn on me: Darwin is expensive. Well, Australia in general is expensive, but being the first stop, Darwin shocked me. Imagine how big my eyes got and how low my jaw dropped when I got hold of my first bottle of soda at a convenience store. Four dollars a bottle is quadruple the price I am used to. As a frugal guy who spent most of his life in Southeast Asia (where almost everything is cheaper than in almost anywhere else in the world), in my early days in Oz, I bled every time I wanted to eat. But you know what they say, stop converting, otherwise you’ll spoil the fun.       Despite the high price of almost everything in Darwin, she had come to snatch my fickle, cheap heart. While we initially treated her as our jumpoff point to Kakadu and Litchfield national parks, we slowly discovered her many simple spots. She’s unassuming, but she has a lot to offer. Yes, she’s a bit high-maintenance: some dates are hardly within the limits of financial capacity. But on some days, the bill was on her. Here are some of the places that she treated me to at no to little cost. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Mindil Beach Sunset 2. Mindil Sunset Market 3. George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens 4. Fannie Bay Gaol 5. Adelaide River War Cemetery 6. Bicentennial Park 7. City Walk 8. World War II Tunnels 9. Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory 10. Deckchair Cinema Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Mindil Beach Sunset As a peninsular city, Darwin’s coast is naturally glazed with supple beaches. But one of the most popular, and rightly so, is Mindil Beach. Swimming is not advised all months of the year (bummer, I know, blame the box jellyfish), but its west-facing, wide bed of beige sand makes it a front-row seat for that honey-colored sunset. Darwin’s heavenly show. Address : Maria Liveris DriveCost : FREE   2. Mindil Sunset Market And if your timing is just right, you’ll also get to partake in a feast (not free, of course). Every Thursday and Sunday, food stalls mushroom along Maria Liveris Drive, offering a smorgasbord of gastronomic delights. Darwin is a multi-cultural city, so expect a wide range of cuisines. The choices at the Mindil Sunset Market are endless! Pizza, burgers, seafood, Asian, Western, name it. Address : Maria Liveris DriveOperating Hours : Thursdays and Sundays of May-October, 4-9pmCost : FREE   3. George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens Just across the street from Mindil Beach is the 42-hectare George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens, just 2km north of the city’s central business district. Established in 1886, the 130-year-old gardens have survived many cyclones and even World War II. They showcase Northern Australia’s monsoon flora, including those found in Tiwi Islands and Arnhem Land. Address : Gardens RoadOperating Hours : 7am-7pm, DailyCost : FREE   4. Fannie Bay Gaol Not too far from the Gardens lies the historic Fannie Bay Gaol. Operational from 1883 to 1979, this prison had sheltered the Northern Territory’s offenders, including Jerry Coci and Jonus Novotny, the last inmates to be hanged here. Accessible to the public are the gallows, where these executions were carried out. My bestfriend Wikipedia describes the site, “A pit was dug into the floor at one end of the building, with brick walls either side to support the beam. A small trapdoor and flight of steps led down into the pit for the doctor to examine the bodies after the drop. The prisoners were held in wire cages at the other end of the infirmary prior to execution.” Address : East Point Rd &amp; Ross Smith AveOperating Hours : 10am-5pmCost : FREE   5. Adelaide River War Cemetery The Bombing of Darwin was the first and biggest direct attack on Australia by a foreign power. On 19 February 1942, 242 Japanese aircraft led two air raids on the city of Darwin. It was just the beginning of a series of attacks that pushed Australia to widen its participation in World War II. (Australia had been involved in the war against Germany as a British commonwealth.) Today, there’s hardly any reminder of that gruesome day, but its aftermath is felt the hardest at the Adelaide River War Cemetery, where Australian soldiers and civilians who perished that day were buried and are honored. Address : 97 &amp; 105 Memorial Terrace, Adelaide RiverCost : FREE   6. Bicentennial Park Like the War Cemetery, the Bicentennial Park pays tribute to the souls lost during the Battle of Darwin. War memorials and monuments dot the map of the park, which makes a walk in it all the more insightful and educational. The truth is, walking along these greens is like having a tour of the city, for it straddles the length of the waterfront, lying next to many of the area’s key landmarks. Follow the signs and you will find trails leading to small beaches. Several species of birds, including the sometimes intrusive Australian white ibis, can be spotted here. Australian white ibis birds walking around the park Address : EsplanadeCost : FREE   7. City Walk Darwin isn’t really known for centuries-old structures — the war made sure there won’t be much left — but it does take pride in a few historic gems. One of these is the Lyons Cottage, aka British Australian Telegraph House. The only remaining colonial bungalow building in the city, this stone house was built with quarried porcelanite stone. The Parliament is often referred to as “The Wedding Cake” On the other end of the spectrum is the quite modern Parliament House, dubbed by many “The Wedding Cake.” Completed in 1994, it is the seat of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Cost : FREE   8. World War II Tunnels If what’s on the surface doesn’t quite appeal to you, maybe you’ll be fascinated by what lies beneath. Following the Japanese air raid of 1942 which also bombed the oil storage tanks of the city, the government started the construction of tunnels that would safely shelter fuel oil. Today, only two of them are open to the public, and they house a photo exhibit depicting life in Darwin during the war. Address : Kitchener DriveOperating Hours : May-September: 9am-4pm, October to April: 9am-1pmClosed : 1-27 December, New Years Day.Cost : Adults AUD5, Children AUD3   9. Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory Popularly known as MAGNT, it showcases Northern Territory’s cultural and natural history, divided into five permanent galleries. Some of the key highlights are an 18-foot saltwater crocodile called “Sweetheart,” notorious for attacking humans decades ago; and accounts on Cyclone Tracy, one of Australia’s most devastating storms, killing 71 people and destroying over 70% of infrastructure. Address : 19 Conacher Street, The GardensOperating Hours : Monday-Friday 9am-5pm, Weekends, 10am-5pmClosed : New Year’s Day, Good Friday, Christmas, Boxing Day,Cost : FREE   10.

This is a favorite among locals and tourists alike. Address : Jervois Road off Kitchener Drive, Wharf PrecinctOperating Hours : Opens at 6:30PM, April-NovemberCost : AUD 13 Where to stay : Darwin is the closest major city. Darwin YHA Hostel offers affordable accommodations right at the heart of the city center and with fast internet connection. Day tours are also available. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/05/free-things-to-do-in-brisbane-australia/,australia,"10 FREE Things to Do in Brisbane, Australia The moment I reached Brisbane, a weird feeling took over my senses. There I was, at the sixth and final stop of our tour around Australia, but it felt as though I was just starting the journey. Weeks of being in the middle of flat, barren deserts and isolated, small islands had left me adjusting again. Suddenly, multi-story buildings and parades of cars are strangers that I needed to get to know or lost friends I would need to reconnect with. Perhaps the feeling was brought about by sheer exhaustion. By the time we hopped off the train from the airport, we were almost bereft of energy.       The more we walked, however, the less we wanted to stop. Brisbane may be a bona fide metropolis, but it isn’t as bustling or chaotic as other cities. If anything, it isn’t chaotic at all. Despite the concrete pavements and tangled streets, life here seems to move at a gentle pace. We discovered something pleasant at every turn. On our way to Riverlife at Kangaroo Point, for example, we stumbled upon many interesting sites including the Nepalese Peace Pagoda, the Streets Beach, and the Queensland Maritime Museum. Curious (sometimes out-of-place) artworks are scattered across the city and the suburbs. What’s more, many of these can be enjoyed at no or little cost. Here are some of ’em.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. King George Square, Brisbane City Hall, and Brisbane Museum 2. Albert Street Literary Trail 3. Queen Street Mall 4. City Botanic Gardens 5.

It is surrounded by many recognizable landmarks including the Brisbane City Hall, a recently refurbished building that you may explore on a free guided tour. Don’t miss Brisbane Museum and the Clock Tower tour!   2. Albert Street Literary Trail Rejoice, bookworms and poetry fans! Time to go for a walk. And a walk in Brisbane can be as educational and inspirational as it is relaxing. You know you’re on Albert Street when you see this church Brisbane’s Albert Street is punctuated with 32 brass plaques installed on the pavement, all bearing literary quotes from 32 Queensland writers, who have lived in the city at one point in their lives. The trail was launched at the 1996 Brisbane Writers Festival. Francis Adams, Andrew McGahan, David Malouf, Steele Rudd, and Kath Walker are just some of the authors whose words are immortalized in Albert Street.   3. Queen Street Mall Queen Street Mall Entrance Entertaining over 26 million visitors a year, the Queen Street Mall is said to be the most popular pedestrian mall in Australia. Situated adjacent the City Hall and just across King George Square, it is a vibrant lifestyle destination at the heart of the Central Business District. Flanking its streets are more than 700 choices of apparel stores, restaurants, and souvenir shops. Don’t forget to make a stop at the QueensPlaza, Wintergarden, Brisbane Arcade, and Tattersall’s Arcade.   4. City Botanic Gardens The oldest park in Brisbane, this was once a land tended by convicts to produce crops for the prison colony but was later transformed into a public space for recreation. Situated by the river, it allows a great view of the skyline, serves as a perfect picnic venue, and offers great walking and biking lanes. Two of the most visited sections are the Bamboo Grove, which showcases 23 bamboo species, and the Weeping Fig Avenue, planted in the 1870s. Other attractions include the ornamental ponds and the Jemmy Morrill and the Brolgas sculpture. You may take a free guided walking tour, available from Monday to Saturday (11am-1pm).   5. South Bank Parklands You know you’re in the South Bank Parklands area when the 42-gondola Wheel of Brisbane towers above you. Opened to the public in 1992, this complex of plazas, restaurants, greens, and rainforest cover what used to be the site of the World Expo 88. There’s a lot to see here, including the Nepal Peace Pagoda, constructed by German architect Jochen Reier as part of the Kingdom of Nepal’s participation in the Expo. The Wheel of Brisbane Nepalese Peace Pagoda If you’re dining here, beware of these birds. They’re terrorists! They’re ruthless! Grand Arbour Visitors may also choose to walk around and enjoy the scenery at the riverfront promenade and the Grand Arbour, a kilometer-long bougainvillea-canopied arched pergola that covers a pedestrian walkway linking the Cultural Forecourt to the Griffith Film School.   6. Streets Beach Part of the South Bank Parklands, the Streets Beach is a unique man-made lagoon next to the Brisbane River. Being here gives that illusion that you have left the metropolis, but it is the only beach within a city in all of Australia. It is a swimming beach, complete with glittering white sand, fringed with tropical trees. Swimming is allowed here. Streets Beach Streets Beach   7. Fashion and Art Weekend Markets Over the past years, Brisbane has seen pop-up markets sprout in its streets and parks.

Kangaroo Point offers not only fantastic vistas of the Brisbane River and the Central Business District but also free use of grills and tables situated atop the cliffs.   10. Live Music On the way back to the hostel from Kangaroo Point, we passed through South Bank Parklands once again, but we our attention was stolen by an acoustic act happening in one of the greens. Brisbane’s music scene has been exploding over the past years, and if you know where to go, you can actually join a gig at no cost.

Adelaide, and in particular the beach suburb of Glenelg, is an ideal place to experience the finer things in life. Home to a marina filled with yachts and amazing restaurants, picture-perfect beaches and surrounded by gorgeous scenery and vineyards as far as the eye can see, it has plenty to offer any traveller. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? My favourite hotel in Adelaide is the Stamford Grand , a hotel that’s full of class and with stunning views of the ocean. It has luxurious rooms and the greatest seafood buffet you’ll ever have, as well as a foodie’s dream of a breakfast. In the city, the Rendevous is modern perfection. Sleek rooms with amazing views of Adelaide and jaw droppingly fabulous bathrooms and make this a perfect city destination. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? If swimming with sharks is your idea of adventurous, then Adelaide is the perfect place! There are lots of water activities to enjoy, as well as skydiving and camping adventures in the bush. Check out even more things to do in Adelaide . Where are the best hang outs during the day? Glenelg is the best place to be in Adelaide, in my biased opinion! It has a lot to offer. There’s the main street, the epitome of a holiday resort that manages to be both kitschy and chic. The beach and jetty are gorgeous places to hang out. In the summer it’s packed with tourists and volleyball playing Aussies, people jumping off the jetty, there’s an open air cinema and spectacular sunsets. In the winter it’s just as beautiful, only you may want to swap your gelato for a coffee. The city centre has lots of parks which are perfect for picnics, and are really popular for weddings. In the summer, Adelaide has lots of festivals which are so much fun.   If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Adelaide, and what are their best dishes? For a date night, my favourite place is Pure , a laidback yet stylish heaven, with trendy décor, very cool waiters and possibly the best food and coffee in South Australia. For a more romantic setting, Cardones on Jetty Road is perfect. Their oysters are the best I’ve had. Any of the restaurants along the marina are also great spots for a date. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? I think for something sweet, Adelaide’s best offerings are found in their gelato shops, which tend to have queues out the door no matter what time you get there. Afternoon tea in the Grand is another winner, they even offer a take away version, so you can enjoy your cakes by the sea. In the city, there is a hole in the wall in Chinatown that sells only macaroons! They come in cute little individual boxes which makes them all the more enjoyable!   Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Sunset is all about the beach. Any patch of sand in Glenelg gives you a perfect view of the sunset. In Glenelg, the Grand (again) offers a great view, as do any of the bars along the marina. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot.   Well, a not-so-glamorous spot is the iconic Jetty Bar on Jetty Road. Filled with backpackers and Aussie holiday-makers, it’s a good spot for some pre-game fun. The Dublin is also great for a good time. The Sunset Bar and The Pier on Glenelg’s marina, and Casablabla in the city centre are perfect for cocktails."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-vienna/,austria,"What makes Vienna a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Vienna is one of the original ‘glamour cities’ of Europe. Historically it was home to royalty for centuries and even now it has an understated elegance and luxurious lifestyle. The most luxurious thing about the city is not the architecture, or the classical music, or the cuisine (although they are all fab!) but the calm, quiet atmosphere. Walking the city centre of Vienna you never feel rushed, or surrounded by crowds. It’s truly luxurious because it moves at its own, relaxed pace. There’s also so much to choose from – art, museums, fantastic outdoor activities, historic sightseeing….you cannot get bored here. What 5 star hotel is the best in Vienna? The Grand Dame of luxury hotels in Vienna is the Hotel Imperial . With original architecture from 1863, this is the ultimate in 5 star luxury. Butler service and views across the Ringstrasse included. This is the kind of place diplomats, Queen Elizabeth II and Brangelina stay in when they visit Vienna. Extremely traditional and a good option if you want to experience life like a European Monarch on your visit! For more info on where to stay in Vienna , click there. What about boutique hotels in Vienna, of them all, which would you send your friends or  family to stay at? The boutique hotels in Vienna are, to my mind, much more interesting than the traditional classic hotels. The best of them is the Hotel Altstadt which offers suites, single rooms and apartments designed by famous architect Mattheo Tun and local fashion designer Lena Hocheck. This place is in the über-cool 7th district, housed within a Viennese apartment block just a short walk from the Museums Quartier. The Altstadt has individually designed rooms, with works by   Niki de Saint Phalle, Annie Leibovitz and Andy Warhol scattered throughout. Its an art-design boutique hotel dream! I would recommend this to everyone to get a real feeling of artistic Vienna. Are there any fun activities in Vienna for the adventurous traveler? The Viennese are all about getting outdoors – there’s fantastic cycling paths, hiking trails in the national parks surrounding the city and loads of city parks and gardens to burn your energy. The best place to head in summer for adventure activities is the Donau Insel – you can go rock climbing, kayaking, try wakeboarding on a cable across the Danube, hire a Stand Up Paddleboard, cycle the length of the island and even go retro and try in-line skating.  Afterwards there’s some great bars along the canal to wind down and watch the sunset. Chilling beside the Danube Where are the best hang outs during the day? The cafe culture in Vienna is ingrained in the cities identity. You can spend hours in coffee houses where Einstein, Freud and famous artists of the 20th century hung out. Cafe Hawelka and Cafe Central are two of the best traditional coffee houses. For non-traditional, head to Zamm, Wirr or Liebling, the cities best third-wave coffee hipster cafe’s. Traditional Cafe Hawelka – philosophers hangout spot Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best desserts in Vienna? Vienna is a dessert obsessed city. I definitely put on about 5kg’s in my first months of living here, and I blame it entirely on the dessert options! Vienna is the birthplace of apple strudel and Sacher Torte, so you are never going to be short of choices here. The best traditional dessert experience is in Cafe Demel. They have been making pastries and chocolates for the Viennese since 1786 – and for centuries were the official bakers of the royal family. The mini-cakes are to die for and especially good if you can’t make up your mind! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Vienna; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? The Golden Quartier in Vienna’s 1st district is home to all the major international designers – Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Yves St Laurent and major luxury labels. But if you want more local luxury designers you are better off heading to the grittier 4th district. There you’ll find Mäannersache, an Austrian cravat &amp; shirt designer for men that sources and produces all products locally. Their classy and colourful shirts are not for shy guys. If you’re a luxury vintage fan Flo Vintage has a lovingly curated collection from the last 100 years of fashion. Wall in the 7th district offers the best in local and European designers – it’s especially good for leather jackets and accessories for the home. Wall in the 7th District Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Head for the hills and sit in a local ‘Heuriger’. These are little wineries that offer small tasting plates and delicious, locally made wine. There’s some gorgeous Heurigers with views looking over the city of Vienna and the Danube which are perfect for sunset views. My personal favourite is a tiny little hut on Wilhelminenberg – Heuriger Leitner offers killer views, and the best home-made desserts in all of Vienna. Their meals are excellent value and it is so small you can be guaranteed an exclusive view over the city. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening  drinks. There’s some excellent cocktail bars throughout the city but the absolute best is The Sign in the 9th district. They have award winning mixologists and make creative cocktails in a classy lounge setting. From sweet fairy-floss encased drinks, to concoctions in popcorn containers and the best damn martini’s in the city, you’ll plan on starting the night here, and probably end up accidently staying all night! I love this place for the atmosphere and surprising combinations in a really smooth setting – always good for a glamorous girls night out."https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,austria,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,austria,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-leuven/,belgium,"What makes Leuven a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Leuven is known as a university city but don’t let that fool you. It has some amazing restaurants, medieval architecture and even some UNESCO sites. Leuven is also home to the international brewing company AB Inbev and with the Belgian beer scene just being honored with the title of UNESCO World Heritage, it’s the perfect place to go for some quality beer tastings. Luxury in Leuven isn’t screamy or glittery, it’s classy, subtle and you need to know where to find it. What 5 star hotel is the best in Leuven? I would definitely recommend the Martin’s Hotel . It’s a four-stars, but perfectly illustrates the luxurious side of the city. Martin’s Hotel used to be a monastery with a history dating back 500 years. It’s a listed building combining historical charm with modern comforts. The hotel offers guests the option of booking a golf pass with which they can reserve greens at a preferential rate at no less than 19 golf courses in the area. What about boutique hotels in Leuven, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? I would tell them to check out Guesthouse Begijnhof. This too is a historical building, dating back to the 17th century, and it’s located right outside from the Big Beguinage , Leuven’s top UNESCO site.   The Guesthouse is tastefully renovated, offering guests all modern comforts as well as a homemade breakfast buffet every morning. In winter, you can socialize with other guests in the communal living with fireplace, while in summer the garden doors are wide open. Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Leuven ? Where I live, just outside the city center, Heverlee Woods starts. In this large forest you can go mountain biking or even go on a carriage ride. Leuven is also the town of the River Dijle, which means you can go kayaking, canoeing, or supping. True adventurers take part in the “Vaartchallenge” or “Canal Challenge” that takes place once a year in summer and tests teams by letting them do all kinds of tests on the water. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Leuven ? Leuven is home to many fun cafés but there’s only one real place to be: the Old Market. This square is also known as Europe’s longest bar as all except for one building on this square houses a cafe or eatery. For a trendy establishment, head to the back of the square where you can find bar Louvain Louvain serving great cocktails. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Leuven and what are their best dishes? Couvert Couvert on the Sint-Jansbersesteenweg 171 in Heverlee, just outside the city center, boasts a Michelin star. It’s refined French cuisine is served by an always- friendly staff. If you want to stay in the city center, head to Zarza on Bondgenotenlaan 92. The dishes look like artwork and what you get to taste here is true Belgian cuisine. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? There are lots of places serving a delicious dessert, but if you want to do it “the Leuven way”, you’ll go to ice cream bar ‘t Galetje in the Tiensestraat. This place is iconic and in summer it’s not unusual to find lines so long they block the street here. All the ice cream sold here is homemade. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Leuven who’s carrying the trendy local designers? The Diestsestraat and the Bondgenotenlaan are Leuven’s two main shopping streets, but that’s not where you need to be to find the trendy independent boutiques. Although… there’s one exception. At P.J. Van Benedenstraat 5, a small street connecting the Diestsestraat and the Bondgenotenlaan, you can find WEAR. They sell casual smart clothes for men and women that are hard to find elsewhere. Luz de Luxe at Parijsstraat 40 offers selected brand items for women who both want to look good and feel at ease, while Hippo Royale at number 44 is a must-shop for those who want a vintage look without shopping second-hand. LIV at Mechelsestraat 16 sells stylish, no-frills Scandinavian and French brands while Belva back at Parijsstraat 16 is the place to be for fashion by Belgian female designers. And if interior design is more your thing, head to Design District (Justus Lipsiusstraat 18), where you can find a nice selection of Scandinavian furniture and decorative elements. Where should art lovers go in Leuven? The M Museum always has some nice exhibitions on and often combines historical with modern art. The Schouwburg or City Theater puts on the bigger plays, while art center STuK is known for its experiential performances. The latter is also a great place to catch international (non-Hollywood) movies. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? I’d take the bus out of the center to Kessel-Lo, a borough of Leuven, where I’d go to the Kesselberg. From that hill you can see all over Leuven. It’s the perfect spot to catch a sunset! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. De Professor and Bar Entreprise (Naamsestraat 20 and 18) are two icons in Leuven’s cocktail scene, offering great drinks in a cozy ambiance. De Professor’s interior is rather basic, while the mood at Entreprise is warm, with comfortable couches, high chairs and wooden tables. For a more trendy place, head to Mattiz (Naamsestraat 53) where you can also get tapas or Bar Nine (Oude Markt 9), where you can enjoy your cocktail in a vintage interior and dance the night away on the weekends. If you end the night at a fancy club in Leuven which one do you head towards? Being a rather small city, Leuven doesn’t really have a club scene. People will be more likely to head to a dance café on the Oude Markt for some cocktails and shaking or attend a live show at a place like At The Bebop (Tiensestraat 82)."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-ghent/,belgium,"What makes Ghent a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? To answer this question, I have to tell you something about the Ghent mentality. Ghent despises pretentiousness. We do luxury in a different way. Forget about the glimmer and glamour and be ready to engage in a more down to earth kind of luxury. The kind without the bells and whistles, but featuring high product quality, authenticity and respect for history and nature. Ghent is one of the most romantic cities in Europe. It’s small enough that you can visit the entire old city in just a few hours on foot without feeling stressed about ticking off must-sees. To do so, leave your heels at home as you’ll only end up ruining them (and your ankles) as you wander in the cobbled streets. The city boasts plenty of cutting edge boutiques, fabulous restaurants, hip coffee bars and has a vibrant night life. Romance, food, shopping, and people watching in hip cafés, doesn’t that sound like pure European glamour? What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? I would certainly not recommend staying in a 5 star hotel during your visit to Ghent as you’d be missing out on what gives the city its character. Instead, stay at a bed and breakfast or a picturesque boutique hotel. Try “ Snooz Inn ” for comfort and luxury in the heart of town or “ Ganda ”, an 18 th century townhouse turned charm hotel with unique deluxe rooms. If you’d like to stay somewhere with a sauna and a gym, I’d suggest “ Hotel Verhaege ”, another redesigned 18 century townhouse with ornate high ceilings and attention to detail in its design. Do check out the Mariott hotel in the centre of town, it’s the most unique one I’ve seen so far. The hotel is set in a renewed historical house which used to serve as a brothel in the Middle Ages. Even if you’re not staying there, pop in for a quick look or have a drink in the lobby bar. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous ? For the culinary adventurous, Ghent will not disappoint. Go on a beer tasting adventure and discover some of Belgium’s finest or strangest beers, which are always served in their matching glass. Watch out though, Belgian beers are very heavy! Have a meal at “ Bugs&amp;Lunch ” where, you can sample the latest urban culinary trend: insect based delights. If you’re looking for something more active, you can rent a kayak, a SUP board or a motorboat to cruise down the city’s waterways, it’s a great way to marvel at the city’s architecture or to visit the beautiful suburbs. Where are the best hang outs during the day? During the summer months there are lots of outdoor hang out places in the city. Head to “ Park Café ” for a drink in a fairy-like park or get a shot of contemporary art and music at “DOK Gent”. The city is full of parks, squares and terraces where locals love to catch some rays as soon as the sun is out. Just sit back, relax and do some people watching. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Ghent and what are their best dishes? With 653 restaurant in this tiny city of 100 000 inhabitants, you can imagine choosing a few favorites is not an easy task.   Try the refined 7 course meal at “ Volta ”, a foodie’s favourite. For some modern Flemish cooking by a Michelin starred chef, head to “ JEF ”.   If you’re looking to be more spontaneous, go to the charming medieval neighbourhood of “ Patershol ”, its winey cobbled streets are full of fantastic restaurants. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Belgium is internationally known for its exquisite chocolate but did you know it also boast an insane amount of fine pastries? A true desert-lover’s paradise! An all time favourite for old-fashioned Ghent delicacies is “ Temmerman ”, a sweetshop that has been around since the 19 th century. Real chocoholics should try to find “ Yuzu ”, an off-the –beaten track chocolate boutique showcasing the unusual and sophisticated chocolate creations of a talented local chocolatier. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? If you’re looking for trendy local designers and unique pieces, you should definitely steer clear of the two main shopping streets: Veldstraat and Langemunt , which is where you will find the big commercial, international brands. For great boutique shopping head to “ Brabantdam ”, “ Sint-pieters Nieuwstraat ” and “ Vlaanderenstraat ” where you will find lots of great shops featuring brands by local as well as international designers. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? The best place to end the afternoon and start an evening in Ghent is at the “ Graslei ”.   This is the main hang out spot on sunny days. The riverbanks fill up with all sorts of people, drinking an “apéro”, eating, singing and having a good time with friends. Most young people sit on the ground by the river, but if you prefer to do it the luxurious way, there are plenty of higher end terraces along the water where you can enjoy the view and atmosphere with a drink in your hand. Relax as the sun sets and watch the city lights turn the old city into a magical place. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? As many bars and restaurant as there are in Ghent, the clubbing scene is quite low key. Don’t get me wrong the nightlife is absolutely popping but fancy clubs are just not what the people of Ghent care for. Start with an exclusive cocktail at “ Jiggers ” (best to reserve in advance) or have a drink at “ Bar des Amis ”. Once you’re ready to bust a move, see if anything is going on the “ Culture Club ” or the “ White Cat ”. There is live music in several bars every day of the week. The best way of knowing where to go is by asking a “cool-looking” local what is going on that night and take it from there."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,belgium,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-cochabamba/,bolivia,"What makes Cochabamba a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Cochabamba, is not a very well-known destination, and therefore maybe not the most obvious destination if you look for glamor. However, here you can get a lot of luxury for little money, and there are many opportunities. Cochabamba is also called the food capital of Bolivia, and it is in this city you find all the best restaurants. The city is also surrounded by beautiful enormous mountains. And what can possible be nicer than driving up there at night, having a glass of wine looking down at the beautiful lights of the city!? What 5 star hotel is the best in your town?   That must be Gran Hotel Cochabamba . Whenever I am there I really feel like a queen. The hotel has everything! Comfortable big rooms, good service, great food, gym and spa. My favorite is the temperate pool, which lights so beautifully up in the night. A stay at Gran Hotel Cochabamba, is like being in the countryside in the city due to the big gardens. It has an elegant style, and they have preserved the original marble, and decorations from 1940. Other parts are more modern, but still have that elegant style. The location of the hotel is also the best you can find. It is right with the best shopping area, museums, nigh-clubs and restaurant area in town. The hotel have hosted many celebrities. Bob Dylan, and Michael Jackson, are just two worth to mention. And a stay here will for sure make you feel like a famous person as well! A double room for two people cost 117 USD per night. However, I would recommend to pay a bit extra to get a bigger room. If you really would like glamour and luxury I recommend the presidential suite. That is the biggest and nicest room I have ever had on my travels.   Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?   Hiking in the beautiful and gigantic mountains or up to the Jesus statue, which is even bigger than the one in Rio de Janeiro. Cochabamba is also a perfect location to try paragliding, due to the big mountains. Cochabamba also have the biggest outdoor marked in South America, here you can find everything, and it is a big experience walking around in “La Cancha”.   Where are the best hang outs during the day?   There are many awesome cafes to hang out on during the day. My favorite is Casa Blanca, which is located a few blocks from the main square, 24 de Septiembre, and one block from one from the beautiful El Prado. Here you can enjoy a cup of coffee, cake, read a book, use internet, or just have a good time with your friends.   If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Cochabamba and what are their best dishes? Hmm, this is a bit hard, as Cochabamba have so many great restaurants. However, I think it must be Paprika . It is one of the most fancy restaurants in the city. The fondue is my favorite dish, and the garlic bread they give while waiting for the food is the best ever tasted. The service is outstanding.   Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? The brownie with ice-cream at Tuesday is the best dessert I have tried in Cochabamba, so far. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Are there designers we should make sure to meet? The best and most trendy shopping spot is Quero Quero. Here you can find everything from designer clothes to brand clothes. The most well know designer is Edita Vojikova. She designs beautiful clothes, I especially love her dresses. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Cochabamba? Seriously, they are everywhere, and I have never gone wrong. They are all pretty good, as long as you do not go to the cheapest. Nails, hair and make-up they will do it all well. I do not have a favorite, and try out new salon and spas all the time. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Up with the Jesus statue. Here you have a gorgeous view of the whole city and the sunset. Believe me, here you can sit for hours, it is view that you will never get tired. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Oasis, is one of my favorite place to go for an evening drink. However, in the area around the main square (city center) there are many good bars, and just walking around you have a ton to choose between. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Mandarina, is the fanciest club. Remember to dress well, if not you will feel out of place. Be prepared for Latin music, and having a good time."https://hippie-inheels.com/crazy-party-guide-to-rio-carnival/,brazil,"This guide to Rio Carnival will hopefully help you plan your trip to Rio de Janeiro. Guide to Rio Carnival Glitter clung to every part of my body, my eyelashes were stuck together and the smell of dancing, intertwined bodies with sweat glistened skin hung heavy in the air. Nobody else in my hostel dorm stirred. This was the morning after the night before, Carnival (Carnaval in Portuguese) had claimed us as it’s victims and carried us into the early hours. I’d danced the soles off of my Havaianas, clinked caipirinha glasses with newfound friends into dawn and filled my ears with the sound of samba. I’m now reliving my time in Rio de Janerio to bring you my crazy guide to Rio Carnival, the most famous and celebrated festival on Earth! Taking place over five electrically charged days, forty days before Easter, Rio de Janerio Carnival attracts over 500,000 tourists per year and is known as the carnival capital of the world. The party officially gets under way in the laid-back beach city on Friday and finishes on Fat Tuesday, just before Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. In all its grandeur, Carnival is an act of farewell to the pleasure of flesh and now engulfs the whole month of February. Carnival for the Ultimate Partier Prepare to have gravity-defying feather headdresses, extravagant beaded costumes, and rhythmic percussion bands encircle you with their contagious energy in the highlight of the festivities, the Rio Samba Parade in the Sambodromo. It is the most OTT party on the planet and it will leave you completely mesmerized. The best samba schools from across the city battle it out in front of a panel of judges, sequins flashing, smiles brimming and hips swinging. Time to take the party outside, Brazilian style. Street parties take place all over Rio, but there isn’t a party like a Lapa street party. Vendors line the central nightlife spot with free flowing cachaça, samba music floating hazily from the surrounding bars. To get a true sense of the flavor of Brazil, you can’t leave without courageously throwing back a few caipirinha’s, Brazil’s signature cachaça cocktail. After the after party, try Rei do Limão Caipirinha, which is just near the Lapa steps. The small, inconspicuous takeaway bar takes the art of caipirinha creation seriously, making sure to keep spirits high as you dance your way into a new day. After the after party, try Rei do Limão Caipirinha, which is just near the Lapa steps. The small, inconspicuous takeaway bar takes the art of caipirinha creation seriously, making sure to keep spirits high as you dance your way into a new day. For something more civilized, make a reservation at Bar Astor, a glamorous bar in Ipanema with panoramic views. An ideal spot to enjoy your last night, reminiscing on the culture, the glitter and the glam that carnival encircles around you. Where to Sleep At Rio Carnival Tired, weary, hung-over, Carnival will test even the most religious partygoers. Take a much-needed forty winks in neighboring Santa Teresa. Santa Teresa is filled with talented street art, modern art galleries and quirky cafés. Whilst the allure of the legendary glitz and glamour of Copacabana is tempting, save yourself several Reals (the official currency of Brazil, although US dollars are also widely accepted) and check into to Alma De Santa Guest House and leave with a whole host of global travelling companions at this bohemian inspired pousada (Brazillian guest house). Alternatively, check out Airbnb for apartments in friendly neighbourhoods such as Flamengo or Botafogo, often equipped with hammocks, neighbours that will welcome you with samba blaring from 80’s radios and freshly baked pão de queijo (cheese bread). What to see and do in Rio Step away from the street parties and readily welcome a little R n R. Join the throngs of bikini-clad, bronzed Brazilian bodies and head to the beach. Kick back with a revitalizing açai bowl before embarking on a football or volleyball tournament with the locals (I lost, epically, every time I was challenged). Copacabana, Leblon and Ipanema all provide the ideal spot for snap-worthy #NoFilter sunsets framed by towering palm trees however, it’s Arpoador beach that really steals the show. Hangout with fishermen, cute couples and other budding photographers on a rock that juts over the water providing an unrivaled spot to have an evening picnic watching the sunset. Travelers Tip: on a Sunday the roads adjacent to Copacabana beach are shut off from traffic and instead are overrun with scantily-clag skateboarders, rollerbladers and runners. Brazil has no shortage of beautiful people and it is safe to say I resembled Bambi as opposed to a Brazilian- blading expert… Visit the 3 most iconic sites in Rio A visit to Rio de Janerio wouldn’t be complete without visiting three of the most iconic sights in Brazil. Head out early in the morning, after you’ve finished your super-food, staple açai bowl breakfast of course, and check out the notorious Christ the Redeemer statue. The panoramic views from the top make battling with other selfie-loving tourists completely worth it. Also, the location for Pharell’s ‘Happy’ music video, The Selarón Steps , nicknamed the Lapa steps, are one of Rio’s most visited attractions. 125 meters of intricate mosaic tiles constructed by Chilean-born artist Jorge Selarón who claimed it as “my tribute to the Brazilian people”. The steps embody the freedom and passion of the city with their video patterns and patriotic murals. Finally, I opted to step aboard the Sugarloaf Mountain cable car just before sunset and I wasn’t disappointed. Rio comes alive at night and as a kaleidoscope of orange, yellows, and pinks are replaced by the navy night sky and twinkling lights litter the mountainside, you see it as a truly beautiful, captivating city. Secret Suggestion: A five hour bus journey and you’ll reach the waterside town of Paraty, a hidden gem in the Rio de Janerio state. Locals paddleboard out to the fisherman to haggle over todays catch, men argue over chess games for hours and children chase kites through the streets. It’s a tranquil time warp peppered with authentic colonial buildings and cobbled streets, the perfect contrast to the notorious debauchery of carnival!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/05/siem-reap-cambodia-travel-guide/,cambodia,"SIEM REAP ON A BUDGET: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary Last updated: February 2018 I wasn’t supposed to return, but it was just too irresistible. The first time I set foot in the Angkor Archaeological Park, I was on a solo backpacking trip across continental Southeast Asia. Siem Reap was not part of my original route, but it would be such a shame to travel across the region without stopping at the world-famous Angkor Wat. I went out of the way, and it was a good decision. Not only was Siem Reap visually stunning and historically significant, it was also a delightfully affordable city. It didn’t put a dent on my usually fragile finances.       Two years later, my friends and housemates wanted to go backpacking across ASEAN with me, and I was tasked to build our itinerary. This time, I tried to make sure that we won’t be stopping at destinations that I had already visited on my previous journey. But as much as I wanted to skip Siem Reap, I couldn’t deny this experience to my friends. Angkor is a must-see for a reason, and they must see it too. So I returned. The upside, I get to update this travel guide!   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Siem Reap In native Khmer language, Siem Reap means “defeat of Siam,” another name for Thailand. The name was said to be bestowed upon the city by King Ang Chan, after a glorious victory over its neighboring kingdom. Thailand and Cambodia have a long history of conflict. Siem Reap used to be a small village until an expedition into the surrounding forest began in 1901. It was also the year the Angkor was rediscovered, thus changing the fate of the quiet town. Siem Reap gained worldwide attention as the gateway to the archaeological heaven. Since then, the city has enjoyed rapid development. Accommodations from budget hostels to high-end hotels and restaurants from sidewalk eateries to lively dance clubs mushroomed along the streets of the city, lodging, feeding, and entertaining tourists, who are eager to lay eyes on the ancient structures.   How to Get To Siem Reap Siem Reap is easily accessible from many other cities in Southeast Asia. Direct flights from Manila, Phnom Penh, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh City are available. You can also travel by land from other parts of Indochina like Bangkok, Phnom Penh, and Ho Chi Minh City. From Manila . Note: Philippine passport holders can enter Cambodia visa-free. . The cheapest direct flights to Siem Reap from Manila are by Cebu Pacific Air, but AirAsia offers competitive rates too, although it makes a stop in Kuala Lumpur, thus entailing a much longer travel time. One-way fares below if you book way in advance can go as low as P4500. From Kuala Lumpur . AirAsia offers the cheapest fares, which start at USD 27. Malaysia Airlines’ rates, starting from USD 56, aren’t bad, either. From Bangkok . From Bangkok, you have three options: by plane, by bus, and by train. Obviously, the plane is the fastest but most expensive option. The lowest fares are offered by Thai AirAsia (travel time: 1 hour) and Thai Smile Airways (travel time: 1 hour and 25 minutes). If you book in advance, the rates are around USD 57. If you take the bus or train, know that you will have to go first to the border town of Aranyaprathet, go through Immigration, emerge in Poipet on the Cambodian side, and take the government bus to Siem Reap from there. We created a separate post for it here: Bangkok to Siem Reap by Train or by Bus Search for Cheap Flights Here   Where to Stay in Siem Reap While biking around the city, I noticed that most of the high-end hotels lie along the road going to Angkor from the city proper. But the more budget-friendly ones are just around the Old Market area. Aside from the budget, another thing to consider when picking a place to stay is how you plan to spend your time in the city. If you’re the type who likes getting drunk and dancing at the club at night (like me), you might want to consider choosing a hotel or hostel near Pub Street. Actually, I highly recommend this location (around the Pub Street area) because there’s so much to do. The Angkor Night Market is also just around the corner. But here are the top budget hotels and hostels as rated by online users as of May 2017. We considered only properties with at least 20 reviews.

Where to Exchange Currencies While the official currency in Cambodia is the Riel (KHR), US dollars are widely accepted in Siem Reap. Most of the restaurants I dined at displayed USD instead of KHR although they accept both. On my first time in Siem Reap, I ended up spending waaaay too much because I carried Philippine pesos (PHP). Many money changers in Siem Reap accept PHP but the rates are terrible, soooo far from the real forex rates. When I returned, I learned my lesson. Armed with US dollars, I got to experience Siem Reap at a much lower cost. Bottomline, if you’re visiting Siem Reap, bring US dollars .   How to Get Around Siem Reap Siem Reap by Bike Biking . It’s the best and the cheapest way to explore the city. Bikes will cost you $1 per day, and it includes a map and a bottle of water. Tuktuk . One day tour costs $12 to $15 if you’re alone or a couple, $18 if you’re a party of 3. If you really want to save money, form a group of 3 and just split the cost so you only pay $6 per person. You’ll find bike rental shops and tuktuks all around the city, but if you want to make sure you won’t be scammed, ask the staff of your hotel or hostel for their trusted contacts. I simply just find someone parked at the Old Market. Done it twice and I never ran into any problem. Feel free to tip your tuktuk driver if you enjoyed his service. Just round off the fare. For example, the last time I was there, we paid $20 instead of $18. Vins while on tuktuk tour of Angkor.   Places to Visit in Siem Reap Angkor Archaeological Park Like most tourists visiting Siem Reap, my guess is that the primary reason you want to go here is the Angkor Wat so let’s focus on it first. Angkor Wat is such a humongous site that it will take half a day (if not the whole day supposing you’re into the smallest details) to see all its galleries, libraries, corners, and towers. But that’s not the whole picture. It is just the centerpiece of the vast UNESCO inscribed Angkor Archaeological Park that hosts dozens of other temples that are equally captivating and interesting. Bayon Temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia To get a ticket, you just need to go the Ticket Counters near the entrance to Angkor. Here are the costs as of 2017: 1-Day Pass: $37 3-Day Pass: $62 7-Day Pass: $72 Do you need a tour guide? Well, you don’t really need it. You can explore the park on your own easily. However, if you want to appreciate the structures better, I highly recommend that you get one. DO NOT get a guide at the site itself. Some people, sometimes children, will offer their services as tour guides on the spot. Many of them are scammers. I fell victim to one. They charged exorbitant fees! To be sure, you can join a small group tour. Emphasis on SMALL. You don’t want to be part of a big horde that come in bus-fuls. Small, intimate groups ensure a more pleasant experience.

Note that these are just based on my personal experience (so this list depends heavily on the establishments I tried): Angkor tour by tuktuk (3-4 temples): $15 Airport Transfer: $9 Usual cost of a meal (rice/noodles): $2 Usual cost of a drink (shake/coke): $0.75-$1 Here’s a sample 4-day itinerary with breakdown of expenses. This assumes you’re a group of 2 and you’re staying at a budget hotel with free breakfast (like Golden Gecko Villa) for $25 per night ($12.5 per person).

That’s not yet including the airfare and airport transfer (if you’re flying) or the bus/train transfers (if overland).   Other Tips for the Poor Traveler Don’t lose your tuktuk driver . If you’re exploring Angkor by tuktuk, always agree on a meeting point before entering a temple. There are so many tuktuks swarming in front of major structures that it can be difficult to find the one you hired, especially after sunset. Use a good pair of shoes . Trust me, Angkor can bring so much pain to your feet if you’re not wearing good hiking shoes. Avoid getting dehydrated! This whole Angkor tour can be quite exhausting and draining. Bring a bottle of water or buy fresh coconut juice. Read up on Angkor and Khmer history in general before your trip if you don’t have a guide. This will allow you to appreciate the temples and its many features better. Be wary of “guides” offering to tour you around the temple. Most of them will ask for a big “donation” after. Pace yourself . At first you’ll be like, “Oh! So many temples! I’m gonna see them ALL!” But when you’re actually doing it, the temple fatigue kicks in and you might find yourself not wanting to visit any other temple anymore. The key is to just take your time and not rush.

As soon as I stepped on the temple grounds, I felt weirdly belittled but not in a bad way. Angkor Wat is immense, and I’m not talking about just its size. From the intricacy of the bas reliefs in its galleries to its role in the history and culture of Cambodia, everything about this colossal structure must have required tremendous amount of time, resources, effort, and patience. And standing in the middle of the site, I could not help feeling insignificant compared to the surrounding grandeur made of sandstone. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? The Angkor Wat Exploring Angkor Wat: Layout and Architecture Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts The Angkor Wat Angkor Wat literally means “temple city,” and judging by the sheer size of the site, no other name fits better. It is constructed with five to ten million sandstone blocks over 500 acres (208 hectares) of forest. Built in the 12th century under King Suryavarman II of the mighty Khmer Empire, the temple complex was originally used to honor Vishnu, a Hindu god believed to be responsible for the sustenance and preservation of the universe. In the 14th century, however, the site was converted for Buddhism. The largest religious monument in the world, Angkor Wat is a testament to the glory and power of the Khmer Empire, which at one point covered modern day Cambodia and most parts of Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Today Angkor Wat is not only the most popular tourist attraction in Cambodia but also the most important symbol of the country that it appears on the national flag and every possible merchandise in its major cities. Outside the galleries of Angkor Wat Exploring Angkor Wat: Layout and Architecture Truth be told, yes, I was expecting a gigantic temple. What greeted me, however, was a gigantic temple complex . The plan of the site looked simple at first glance but its elaborateness combined with its vastness not only amazes but also disorients tourists, who will often find themselves picking up their jaws on the floor. The complex consists of the central tower, surrounded by three rectangular galleries, surrounded by an outer wall, surrounded by a moat. Confusing, eh? Angkor Wat Layout A closer look at the layout of the Central Sanctuary and the Outer Galleries From the main entrance, a sandstone causeway extends over the moat, piercing through the outer wall, across courtyards, right to the center of the site. The courtyards are also peppered with several much smaller buildings (libraries). Ponds (basins) also cover some parts of the area. Buddhist monks on the causeway to the temple Stone lions guarding Angkor Wat! Stone lions flanking the mouth of the causeway were first to welcome me at the site. Tourists were already flooding the entrance so I decided to stay outside for a moment and watch the water that fronted the temple complex. While most medieval castles had moats as defense from enemy attacks, that of Angkor Wat’s must have served a different purpose. Some say it was just part of a more expansive system of canals that could have been used to regulate irrigation. The water here was so still during my visit that they mirrored the walls and the trees almost perfectly. The only disturbance was the lotus plants that thrived in its waters. The walkway ends at the entry gate, part of the bordering outer buildings, topped with three towers. Their upper portions had already collapsed. From the outside, these front towers block the view of the central quincunx of towers. Once I made it past the gate, I walked on the causeway that stretched from the gate, cutting through a spacious courtyard that was carpeted by grass. To the left was a series of stores selling souvenirs, postcards, and drinks. The entrance to the galleries was fronted by a cross-shaped area known as the Terrace of Honor. The galleries are divided into three layers (or levels) that are arranged to form rectangular borders. The levels rise considerably from the ground as you go inward and, of course, the upper levels are smaller. The lowest levels are roofed and colonnaded galleries featuring magnificent, intricate bas reliefs that depict scenes from religious, historical, and literary texts. These scenes are the following: North : Battle of Gods and Demons, Victory of Krishna East : Victory of Vishnu, Churning of the Ocean of Milk South : Heaven and Hell, The Grand Army West : Battle of Kurukshetra, Battle of Lanka The bas reliefs caught me off-guard. I did not know about this part of the temple and I was mercilessly blown away by the tortuous carvings that crept on the walls. Of all the nooks and spots of the site, it was probably here at the outer galleries that I stayed the longest. I just couldn’t believe how they were able to etch such intricate yet delicate images and patterns on the solid wall on such a massive scale. I stood there with my mouth open, in utter awe the whole time. Bas reliefs at the West Gallery Some carvings of devatas around the site Middle galleries One of the libraries on the second level The topmost level is where the central temple is located. It is crowned with a quincunx of towers, the one at the center being the tallest, said to be as tall as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. These multi-tiered towers take the form of stone lotus flowers that taper to the top like celestial pinecones. All these towers share the same base in the middle of a concrete courtyard of the upper level where most exhausted tourists choose to rest. Guests are allowed to climb the tallest tower provided that they are in good physical condition. There is a newly constructed staircase that visitors may use to reach the top. A word of caution, though — the flight is very steep, the steps small, and the height daunting. At the top, you’ll find two things: the most sacred image in the temple, and a spectacular view of Angkor! The Central Sanctuary. See how small people are compared to the structure? Angkor Wat’s tallest tower View from one of the towers A tourist and her guide at the highest accessible part of the temple Angkor Wat is definitely a hundred times bigger than I expected. Considering that I decided against checking out the libraries and the other galleries due to time constraints, I still ended up completely drained out. Just walking around the site can be quite a test of stamina and sanity. The illustriousness, grandeur, significance, and the size of the site will surely blow your mind as it crushed mine. Indeed, no other man-made structure had made me feel so small.   How to get to Angkor Wat : From the city center of Siem Reap, hire a tuktuk for an Angkor Tour for only USD12. This will take you to three different temples at Angkor Archaeological Park including Angkor Wat. You can also rent a bike for USD1, then hit Vithei Charles de Gaulle, the main road to Angkor Wat. You’ll see the Ticket Office on your right. After getting a ticket, continue taking the same road. Turn left when you reach the moat, then turn right. You’ll see Angkor Wat immediately to your right. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2012/12/siem-reap-food-cambodian-cuisine/,cambodia,"A Taste of Siem Reap, Cambodia Siem Reap is not exactly a food destination. While neighbors Thailand and Vietnam have already gained worldwide popularity for their delectable cuisines, Cambodia is not as well-known for its food as it is for its temples and historical sites. Well, at least here in the Philippines. Thus, I did not have much expectations of my tastebuds bathing in utmost delight during my stay in Siem Reap. Still, this Cambodian city did not disappoint. Many dishes that I tried were cooked simply, prepared fast, and cost cheap! For  someone who isn’t really an adventurous eater anyway and whose budget is very limited, sometimes they are enough.       Actually, during my stay, I found a new appreciation for Khmer cooking. Its simplicity is its greatest strength. Other Southeast Asian cuisines rely heavily on spices and herbs but Khmer cuisine uses them in moderation, not as vital ingredients but as mere flavor-enhancers that they can do without. For example, chili pepper isn’t as popular here unlike in nearby Thailand and Laos. I’m not a big fan of spicy food so I really had a good time dining in Siem Reap. A restaurant at the Old Market in Siem Reap Amok Shrimp. Shrimps in a coconut-based sauce, wrapped in banana leaf and steamed. I wanted to try a freshwater fish but it was not available at the time. I had to settle for shrimps which was fine. Pork spareribs with egg. It reminded me so much of Korean beef stew except that this is pork. Sadly, this bowl did not have much meat in it. I liked the soup, though. Fried noodles with chicken and vegetables. Typical but tasted good. Fried beef. It’s their version of tapa. I forgot the name of this dish but this is eggplant and it’s fantastico! Chicken barbeque sold at street sidewalk! Chicken curry. But it tasted like chicken pastel. Fried rice with beef This one’s actually a Vietnamese dish but I tried it nonetheless. It was the only noodle dish with soup served at a hawker stall I frequented. Tom Yum. Cambodian-style. Mango shake and Rambutan shake. Yep, RAMBUTAN shake. Tried it for the first time and I fell in love with it! If there’s anything that I did not enjoy very much, it is the limited options available. Most of the eateries I tried served only fried rice, fried noodles, some fried meat dishes, and a little bit of amok and freshwater fish. But that was about it. Since more often than not I ate at kerbside restaurants during this Southeast Asian backpacking trip, I could not help comparing the quality of the dishes that I got from each city. Definitely, the streets of Chiang Mai, Bangkok and Hanoi gave me the most delightful time with their scrumptious dishes at a much lower price. However, Siem Reap isn’t bad at all. But then again, I’m not that hard to please. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2012/09/biking-around-siem-reap-cambodia/,cambodia,"Biking Around Siem Reap, Cambodia If you’re the type who sees the glass half-empty, you can say that I crashed and fell from the bike on the way back to the hotel from Angkor Wat, leaving me with two big, nasty wounds on my left leg. If you see the glass half-full, then you can say that after a whole day of biking in the crazy streets of Siem Reap, I’m still alive!       In all honesty, the streets of Siem Reap are not really  that  crazy. I’m just an awful biker. To be fair, it was my first time to ride a bike in 15 years. I was still in primary school when I last rode one, and I just could not get it together anymore. My bike kept on wobbling and my body wiggling, as my arms refused to relax. Still, I survived getting around Siem Reap and even reached Angkor Wat in two wheels in spite of! I don’t think I would be doing it again in the near future, though. Not until I get rid of the wobbling. And the wiggling. That’s my bike! WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Bike Rentals in Siem Reap Learning How to Bike Siem Reap City Tour To Angkor Archaeological Park Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Bike Rentals in Siem Reap The description of biking around the city on the brochure that I got was not very encouraging. It says, “The traffic rules here are slighy different… i.e. whatever they are, everyone ignores them anyway.” Under normal circumstances, I would have dropped the idea especially that I had not tried biking in over a decade. But it was not a normal circumstance. Bebs, a friend of mine who has been living in Bangkok, was so convincing. He promised to teach me how to bike again until I relearned the whole thing. Biking is probably the cheapest way to get around the city. It costs USD1 per day. And it comes with a bottle of water and a map, too! (Compare that to a tuk-tuk tour, which costs USD 12 per 3 stops.) Bike rental shops abound in the streets and alleyways of Siem Reap so it’s NOT difficult at all to spot one. In fact, we found several within the 100-m radius of our hotel. Biking in Siem Reap Bike Rental Shop in Siem Reap Learning How to Bike While the highways of Siem Reap are unforgivingly busy, they stem to the inner streets, where vehicles seldom pass through. I found one parallel Siem Reap River and thought it would be a great place to reclaim my lost biking skills because there was hardly anything there. The street was half paved and half rocky and for over a couple of hours, I struggled to bike on either surface. (Surprisingly, I found the rocky part more favorable.) When the sun scorched the pavement signaling the midday, we decided it was time to hit the highway. For the first time, I rode my bike through busy streets where both drivers and pedestrians seemed to be oblivious to everyone else, and they turned and crossed from all directions like it’s nobody else’s business. My heart pounded so hard every time I hit an intersection. It was like I was dragging my bike around. And many times, I was literally dragging my bike around. Siem Reap River Siem Reap City Tour Because much of the day I spent learning, I only had very little to go around. I had lunch at a cheap restaurant at the Old Market area, exchanged currencies, and visited some interesting places such as the Preah Promreath Pagoda, the Angkor National Museum, and the Shopping Center. (I will be writing about these places in detail on a separate post but here are some photos.) A Restaurant at the Old Market in Siem Reap Street food stalls in Siem Reap. That’s my friend Bebs buying something Preah Promreath Pagoda A bas relief image on one of the pagodas Angkor National Museum   To Angkor Archaeological Park Here’s the thing: A 1-Day Pass to the Angkor Archaeological Park costs USD 20. While most tourists prefer going in the morning, we decided to bike to Angkor to buy tickets at 5pm, which is valid for that day and the next day. So it’s like a pass for more than a day. Yes, the temples close at 6pm but you could still visit at least one within that period and explore the surrounding landscapes. The Road to Angkor Wat Angkor Ticketing Office We actually arrived at the Angkor Ticket Office at 4pm so we had to wait for over an hour for the counters to start selling tickets for the next day. (Again, while the tickets sold from 5pm are for the next day, it can already be used on that day.) It was surprising that so many people turned up despite the time. After acquiring a ticket, we traveled by bike to Angkor Wat , where a gazillion tourists were on their way out. I was able to explore the outer grounds of the temple but chose to leave the inner area for tomorrow’s visit. While there was a temple that gives better view of the sunset, I stayed at the Angkor Wat, by the moat, and watched the ripples that disturbed the peace of the still water that painted a perfect reflection of the ancient stellar landmark next to it. Lotus in the lake surrounding Angkor Wat Statues by the entrance to Angkor Wat The sun was still sinking when we agreed it was time to head back downtown. It was getting dark and the wind cold. Tourists coming from the Temple Complex flooded the street, as motorists rushed to the city. The speed of the overtaking vehicles got me anxious and messed with my head that before I knew it, my bike crashed and I fell from it quite violently. I was lucky that I was at the very side of the road. I was able to get up immediately but my knee and ankle were badly hurt. Despite the accident, I was content that I was able to experience something like this. Never in my life had I imagined that I would go biking around a foreign city. I had always been afraid to try new things even when everyone seems to have no problem doing it and I’m just being a wimp for not trying something so mundane. But that’s what I’m here for. I’m traveling to learn more, experience more, and grow more. The goal is that at the end of this backpacking trip I become wiser, stronger, better. But hopefully, no more accidents."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-phnom-penh/,cambodia,"What makes Phnom Penh a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Phnom Penh may not be known as a glamorous destination, but that is quickly changing. An influx of foreign investment and expats has meant a lot of new businesses geared toward foreigners. There is no shortage of amazing restaurants with cuisines from around the world, luxurious hotels with fabulous pools to beat the heat, huge shopping malls full of popular international brands, trendy bars and even breweries. You can live in luxury for very little money, so we can live and travel much more comfortably here in Phnom Penh than we could in the USA. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? That would have to be the Raffles Hotel Le Royal . This iconic hotel has been a haven for travelers, journalists and entrepreneurs since 1929. From their stunning pool grounds, gourmet restaurants, famous Elephant bar, and luxury spa, this is a truly world class hotel. Though we haven’t stayed here yet ourselves, it has a great reputation throughout the city. Even if you don’t end up staying there, it’s worth going into the Elephant Bar for a drink just to check it out. What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Our moms are coming to Phnom Penh this fall, and we will definitely send them to stay at Amanjaya Pancam , a gorgeous hotel suite located in the heart of the Riverside, a very exciting area of the city. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated plus every room has a balcony overlooking the Mekong river. There is a lovely restaurant on the ground floor offering multi-course meals, and a rooftop restaurant and bar with delicious cocktails, food and some of the best views in the city. Some nights they bring in live music on the rooftop. You can also book a masseuse to come to your room! If you are looking for a quieter location still close to the action, The Pavilion Hotel is the perfect little oasis in the city. It is located behind Wat Botum, just steps from the Royal Palace. However, once you step inside you are transported into a jungle paradise. There are several pools, two poolside bar-restaurants, a gym and a spa. Rooms are $75 per night in low season and $95 in high season, and guests receive a 25 minute complimentary massage on arrival. The hotel also owns two fabulous restaurants in the city, Tepui at the Chinese House and Naturae, a gourmet vegetarian restaurant, and they offer free transportation to both. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? We recently went on a boat cruise at sunset and loved it! It was great to take in a new perspective of the city and witness the activity on the Mekong river closer up. Cambo Cruise offers a sunset cruise with dinner and a large cocktail every day from 5:30-8pm. Be sure to book one day ahead. Another great activity is spending a day on nearby Silk Island . Families living on the island make silk using hand-powered looms. You can purchase beautiful scarves, table runners, bed covers and more, all with a unique story to tell. The island is a beautiful little getaway in the city, just a short ferry ride across the Mekong river. Your hotel or a travel agency can easily make arrangements for you. Some eco-friendly boutique hotels have also popped up on the island if you want to stay the night. Where are the best hang outs during the day? During the day it’s wise to be out of the heat with a cold drink in your hand. Pop into just about any cafe or restaurant in the city for a glass of iced coffee with sweet milk, a Cambodian specialty. If you’re in the Russian Market area, Joma Cafe makes a strong brew and has strong A/C. The Riverside area is a great spot to hang out in the late afternoon. Locals gather to do group exercise, kids run around feeding and chasing pigeons, vendors are selling everything from drinks and snacks to balloons and birds, it’s a lively scene. There are some small temples close to the river across from the Royal Palace where you can observe people praying, burning incense and purchasing lotus flowers. It’s a really bustling area, and we often go there to people watch and take photos. People are so friendly, and if you want to take a picture of someone you can ask in the local language, Khmer, “Som tot moy?” You are almost guaranteed to get a big smile and a lovely photo. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Phnom Penh and what are their best dishes? If you want to splash out on a fabulous five star meal, look no further than Van’s Heritage Restaurant , a French-Cambodian fusion restaurant that is highly regarded in Cambodia. Our friends recently went for their anniversary and were raving about the food, especially the desserts. The restaurant is located at #5 Street 102. Our favorite place for a date night is Romdeng restaurant . Their menu is made up of classic and modern Cambodian dishes, and more adventurous fare like fried tarantulas and beef with fire ants! The setting is romantic and the decor is lovely with carved wood furniture, rich Cambodian silks and vibrant art on the walls. We like to sit outside enjoying the breeze and view of the pool. Not only is the food delicious and the decor beautiful, Romdeng also works to build the futures of former street children and marginalized young people. Sometimes your server will be accompanied by a student who is training in hospitality, making the experience all the more memorable. Romdeng’s location is #74 Street 174. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Cambodia is a former French colony, so there are French quality pastries available all over the city! Our favorite place for dessert has got to be Bloom Cakes. They have 48 flavors of cupcakes, and we’re making our way through trying them all :) Highly recommend the Bailey’s latte and carrot cake with vanilla cream cheese. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Phnom Penh boasts some unique fashion. While you’re here, check out the latest Cambodian couture and local bridal fashion at Rasmei Thirika , a renowned tailor in the city since 1985, located at #58BC on Russian Boulevard. They create gorgeous Cambodian and western style dresses for special occasions, and the beadwork is stunning! For every day wear, up and coming Cambodian fashion designer, Neou Leakhena, designs stylish dresses with a vintage couture influence. You can find her pieces at Lost N Found, a vintage clothing shop located at #321 on Street 63. If you’re looking for high-end international brands head to Aeon Mall or Naga World , two of the largest malls in the country. Aeon even has a cinema playing the latest Hollywood movies. The malls are also great spots to hang out mid-day when it’s too hot to be outside. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Phnom Penh? Champei Spa at #38 on Street 57 in the trendy BKK1 district is my favorite. They have very professional staff who do a variety of massages, facials and body scrubs at really reasonable rates. I went for a Traditional Khmer massage this week-a bit painful like Thai massage, but feels so good afterwards! They also do mani-pedis and there’s a hair salon. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Phnom Penh is very flat. There is only one hill in the whole city! So the best place to take in a gorgeous Cambodian sunset is from a rooftop while sipping a delicious cocktail. Our favorite spot along the Riverside is Le Moon Terrace Bar located on the roof of Amanjaya Pancam Hotel . It’s corner location boasts some of the best views in the area. If you’re in the Russian Market area, The Frangipani Fine Arts hotel has stunning rooftop views and their cocktail menu is stacked with flavorful specialty drinks. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? A great spot for pre-dinner drinks is the Mansion Heritage Bar , located in a beautiful French colonial building across from the National Museum near the Riverside. They open at 5pm and occasionally they have live music as well. Pontoon is a popular nightclub in town. They have events seven night a week, including ladies night, international DJs and even drag shows! We aren’t big on the club scene, but we do frequent some great bars around town. One of our favorites is Che Culo , Italian for ‘lucky bastard’, for the ambiance and great selection of small bites and tasty drinks."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-tofino/,canada,"One day I’ve been told by a fellow traveller there exists a magical place on Vancouver Island called Tofino. A place of surfers, artists and nature lovers. A place of rainforests, rocky beac hes, orcas and eagles. So when I went to see the place, I immediately fell in love with it and ended up living there and exploring the area for almost five months. What makes Tofino a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Tofino is a charming coastal town on the west coast of Vancouver Island. It’s called “the end of the road” because it’s as far west as you can drive in Canada. No Starbucks, no golden arches, no Wal-Mart. It’s truly authentic and unique in world terms. Along pristine beaches there are many luxurious lodges and resorts built in harmony with the nature , some of them awarded as the best in the world. The culinary community is famous not only across Canada and while you may know it as Canada’s surfing paradise, Tofino offers far more than just great waves. What 5 star hotel is the best in Tofino? If you’ve never heard about The Wickaninnish Inn , now it’s the time. This beautiful resort is built on rocks where the strongest waves crash, where eagles fly and nest around. It’s built in harmony with nature, a lot of driftwood was used to carve unique furniture and decorations. Nothing will sing you to sleep more sweetly than the roar of the Pacific just outside your window. What about boutique hotels in Tofino, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? There are many other unique affordable places to choose from and thanks to the geography they all are facing the Pacific ocean. Like Cox Bay Beach Resort with wraparound floor-to-ceiling windows. Sleeping with your sliding doors open is highly recommended. (From $156 per night.). You will love cute cabins of Middle Beach Lodge or Ocean Village Beach Resort . Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Tofino? If you are an adventurous soul, Tofino is a mecca for many different kinds of activities. Take a trip to Hot Springs Cove. There, geothermal pools are naturally heated up to 50°C (that’s hot!) and sit between rocky crevasses in Maquinna Marine Provincial Park. It’s a trip to get there (about an hour and a half boat ride alongside seals, otters and — if you’re lucky — whales and black bears, followed by a 1.2-kilometre stroll through the rainforest atop a floating boardwalk). Take the float plane back to soak it all in from above; it takes Tofino’s magical ruggedness to a whole other level. Walk some of beautiful and easy trails leading through lush rainforest to secret coves or hike a challenging steep trail up to Lone Cone to witness unforgettable view of snow covered mountains and small foresty islands. If you want to get wet, try surf or SUP lessons or go scuba-dive to see amazing marine life of this archipelago. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Tofino and what are their best dishes? The culinary community has always been good out there. There’s a lot of great restaurants. Place everybody buzzing about, multi-awarded Wolf in the Fog in the heart of Tofino tempts guests to gather around a 14-foot communal table made of fir for more locally-inspired eats. Try seaweed salad or the Humboldt squid, caught 300 metres deep off the coast and charred and sliced like a flank steak. Or why not to try smoked oysters wrapped in potato and fried till crispy? Another place to mention is The Pointe Restaurant at the Wickaninnish Inn. It is truly a place for romantic fine dining. With amazing ocean view and cozy fireplace in the middle of the restaurant, people from all around the world are getting engaged there and also coming back years after to celebrate their anniversary. The menu is changing frequently and offers fresh local ingredients from the ocean and woods. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Be sure not to miss Chocolate Tofino, an exquisite chocolate shop and gelateria that uses local ingredients such as foraged blackberries and Vancouver Island honey. Ask owners Kim and Cam Shaw about the secret menu, featuring special flavours such as salted caramel and what Cam describes as a “pretty un-kid friendly” rum raisin. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Tofino? The art in Tofino is just as beautiful, and meaningful, as the nature. Spend any time in a local restaurant, coffee shop or resort and you will see the art. The paintings, carvings, sculptures, statues, jewelry and prints represent the spectacular, diverse land, people and region in vibrant colour, beautiful woods and coarse, often raw materials and glass. Many galleries represent (and sell) native, contemporary, abstract art and everything in between. If you would have to visit just one gallery, go to Mark Hobson Gallery, where you can see Mark’s incredible paintings showing the nature of the area. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Tofino? The Ancient Cedars Spa by the Wickaninnish Inn is balm to your soul. Already arriving to beautiful setting between wild Pacific Ocean and old-growth forest. Their nature inspired treatments, like the 90 minute hot stone massage in the beach cabin will send you to heaven. You can enjoy various treatments together with yoga lessons, eucalyptus steam cave or just chilling out on beach patio right in the spa. Time for a great sunset view in Tofino… where would you go? Tofino is the right place for romantic souls. Once the sun goes down head to some of beaches on the west side of Tofino peninsula. North Chesterman Beach with an island far in the background and dreamatic rock formations is unbelievable place to watch colourful sunsets (and surfers). If you are lucky you can even spot whales, orcas and eagles! In the town head down to Tonquin Beach and while waiting for sunset, explore this beautiful cove and its mysterious caves. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Do you like live music? Lots of many Canadian as well as international musician coming to Tofino to perform. There are amazing live concerts in Jamie’s Inn every week or twice, so why not to sip your drinks while guitars gently weep?"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-toronto-financial-district/,canada,"What makes the Financial district  a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?

Honestly, in Toronto you have some cute boutique hotels but truthfully, I would recommend friends or family to either stay at my place or to rent a guest suite in my building; a cheaper alternative than a hotel room. The Hazelton Hotel in Yorkville, is a swanky boutique hotel where it is known for housing celebrities like the Jolie-Pitts, J-Lo, J-Biebs, Blake Lively and Ben Affleck. Perfect time to celeb spot?

Maman in First Canadian Place is a great place for a “non-corporate” café environment as it transports you to a sweet European café where you can order pressed coffee, loaves and even a cocktail should you feel like it ☺ Take a walk around the downtown area and you will find spots that you will enjoy, the green spaces can be rare but when you find a patch take advantage of it. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in the financial district and what are their best dishes? Special occasions, I would recommend The Chase . These are two of my favourite restaurants for special occasions. The Chase offers incredible food, and an extensive but pricey wine list. The menu switches up, but is never disappointing with a great little patio with a better view than post places. Big date night? Mercatto on Toronto Street is a sweet spot with great Italian food and ambience. Feel like ramping it up a bit more? Check out George Restaurant which providing patrons with a great tasting menu. You don’t know what you’re doing to get but it is always exceptional! Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Oooh, that’s a tough call. If you feel like a creative twist on ice cream..there’s a great spot for it called Sweet Jesus . They serve up killer lattes and churros! If you’re looking for sophistication, and something more bougie take a quick walk to Butter Avenue and check out their gorgeously presented tarts, mini cakes, macarons and dessert options. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? You can never go wrong with shopping in downtown Toronto. Whether you’re looking for designer handbags, couture dresses or well-made pair of jeans. Eaton Centre should be able to satisfy most people, but if you want the Chanel, Givenchy, Tiffany’s, Gucci and Prada; Yorkville is where you need to be. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in the financial district? Elmwood Spa is perfection in the city, one of my favourite “spoil me” spas where you are pampered from beginning to end. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Rooftop of the Thompson hotel ! If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? What tickles your fancy? Tequila lovers, go to Reposado which has a fantastic array of tequila that doesn’t make you feel like you are 19. Pravda is a well-known vodka bar that plays the Russian national anthem at midnight, then you get the samba group up on the bar and if you’re still standing, maybe you will get to do a vodka tasting in their chilly vodka room. New to Toronto, CC Lounge is a whiskey bar but turns into a club on the weekends. It’s more chilled out during the weekdays but if you are looking to party.. these would be some places near financial district."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-whistler/,canada,"Let’s move on to the scenic town of Whistler nestled in the mountains of British Columbia. I have lived here since May of this year and honestly it’s the prettiest place I’ve ever called home. There are hundreds of reasons why you should make Whistler your next luxury travel destination. What makes Whistler a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Whistler is picture-perfect, it’s one of those places that has you saying ‘wow’ every 10 steps. It’s renowned the world over for its skiing, but for me there’s so much more to Whistler. From luxury hotels back-dropped by snow-capped mountains to some of the best restaurants in the world – Whistler has everything you could ask for of a luxury travel destination. What 5 star hotel is the best in Whistler? The Four Seasons located in Whistler’s upper village provides an epic panorama of Blackcomb Mountain. Inside the hotel massive open fireplaces welcome you with open arms and the rooms although luxurious provide a home away from home experience.

All once-in-a-lifetime experiences, I promise you won’t be disappointed. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Whistler? In the summer a walk to Lost Lake is a must-see.   A beautiful nature trail that offers a true Pacific Northwest nature experience. Sit on the banks of the lake and take in the magnificent views or if you’re feeling brave take a swim in its refreshing waters. The best cafe in my opinion is Camp Coffee &amp; Lifestyle Co. in Function Junction – fantastic coffee in a modern lifestyle store. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Whistler and what are their best dishes? My number one choice is Rimrock Cafe near Creekside Village. It is continually ranked as the top restaurant in Whistler, it provides both a unique dining experience and the best fish dishes’ in all of British Columbia, in my opinion. A close second is Araxi in Whistler village which has some very innovative dishes including Quebec Rabbit dish (which is my personal favourite) . Also, worth a mention is Bearfoot Bistro with its famed wine cellar – it has one of the most extensive wine cellars in all of Canada. Their butter poached Atlantic Salmon is amzing. Let’s talk desserts in Whistler- what place makes the best? Purebread is famous in Whistler. You won’t miss it, as there is usually a long winding queue out this small Cafe’s door. Their tantalising display of sweets has everything from Sticky Toffee Pudding to Raspberry Cheesecake Brownie. Pure mouth-watering bliss. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Whistler? Scandinave Spa allows you to relax in the heart of nature. A nordic-inspired 20,000 square foot outdoor spa surrounded by cedar trees. Soak in the outdoor hot tub and experience the beautiful vista of Whistlers natural beauty. Time for a great sunset view in Whistler… where would you go? Lost Lake, in particular the huge pier along the right-side of the lake is an amazing setting to catch the sunset over Whistler Mountain. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Bar Oso offers a profusion of Spanish-influenced small plates and fantastic cocktails in a cosy yet sophisticated environment. With 20,000 plus wine bottles, Bearfoot Bistro’s wine cellar is a must-see, you can also try your hand at sabering a bottle of champagne."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-vancouver/,canada,"What makes Vancouver a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Vancouver is the ultimate glamour destination in Canada, hands down. They don’t call it west coast best coast for nothing! The city has everything you could ever want in a big city, with a breath-taking mountain backdrop, and the ocean always only a few steps away. What 5 star hotel is the best in Vancouver? The Pan Pacific Vancouver is the perfect luxury hotel to be spoiled at. It’s located right downtown, at the harbor front, steps away from luxury shopping. Every room provides the most breath-taking , mountain views. There’s also an outdoor heated pool on the roof that is an absolute dream! What about boutique hotels in  Vancouver , of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The OPUS hotel in Yaletown is the cutest hotel I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Yaletown is an excellent area to be located in, with tons of shopping nearby and great proximity to the water front. The OPUS hotel also provides iPad’s in their guest rooms for use on and off property! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in  Vancouver? Vancouver has got to be the prime spot for adventure travelers; there’s an endless array of options here. One of the top spots for heart racing adventure is the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park. Here you can walk across the 450 foot Capilano suspension bridge over the Capilano River, or if you really want to get your heart pumping, stand on a glass platform on the edge of a glacier. Speaking of glaciers, another absolutely amazing thing to do is take a helicopter ride through the mountain ranges. There are also dozens of whale watching tours that depart between April and October for those who want to catch a glimpse of Vancouver’s incredible wildlife.  Where are the best hang outs during the day in  Vancouver? If you’re feeling outdoorsy, definitely head to Stanley Park! The over 1000 acre park is the perfect for a scenic stroll and a picnic. An alternative hangout option is Buzz Café in Yaletown. The café has unique lattes such as the Lavender Latte, and there’s an art gallery on the upper level. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Vancouver and what are their best dishes? Blue Water Café &amp; Raw Bar is by far the top restaurant in Vancouver. They are well known for their sustainable and tasty seafood. Be sure to make a reservation early, as the waits for walk ins can be rather long, however if you don’t mind sitting at the bar instead, I’ve never encountered kinder bartenders. Another restaurant I absolutely have to mention is the Wildflower diner. They cater to vegans and vegetarians and make the most amazing vegan poutine! Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? I personally love Edible Flours. They’re a vegan bakery making incredible cupcakes, loaves, donuts, and cookies. For non-vegans, I’d recommend Rhino Coffee House. Technically this is a little bit outside Vancouver, in Tofino, however it’s well worth the trip. This donut shop makes up the crazy donuts you can think of from maple bacon donuts to peanut butter and jelly donuts. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Vancouver? If you’re looking to shop until you drop Robson Street is the place to be. There’s over 100 shops ranging from outlet stores to high end designers, boutique stores to department stores, and the Pacific Mall can also be found here. High end brands such as Ferragamo, Tiffany’s , and Gucci can be found scattered through this area. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in  Vancouver? If you’re looking to get a haircut or colour I’d definitely recommended Axis hair salon. I don’t know how they do it, but they work magic when it comes to colouring hair. If you want a truly unique and memorable spa experience, go to Miraj Hammam. They offer a range of Middle Eastern treatments including the signitaure cleansing and purification ritual of the Hammam bath. The hammam is a centuries-old Turkish bath experience to revel in. It’s recorded that there were more than 4,000 private and public baths in Istanbul in the 16th century. During the Hammam at this spa in Vancouver you’ll get to lie on gold marble from Jerusalem in a room filled with eucalyptus steam while you’re exfoliated and purified.  Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? English Bay Beach is one of the most stunning places in Vancouver to watch the sunset. However, if you want an untraditional sunset view, head up to the peak of Vancouver; Grouse Mountain. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Guilt &amp; Co is a great place for pre-gaming. The lounge gives off a really laid back feel, but the life size Jenga and live music keep everyone buzzed! It’s definitely unlike any other lounge in the area and the perfect spot to hit up with some friends. If you end the night at a fancy club in  Vancouver , which one do you head towards? The Roxy is definitely the go to place in Vancouver. This nightclub plays a variety of live music 365 days a year, from country to hip hop, there’s something different every night so you’ll definitely find something you like. Another spot I think everyone should check out at least once is Celebrities night club. This nightclub is a cutting edge dance club that caters to the LGBT community. They do have straight nights, however any night is as fun as any here. You can dress up and be as wild as you like. They’re known for playing unreal tunes by international DJ’s and have a different drink special every night. I’d highly recommend making sure you’re on the guest list for this club as the wait can be very long."https://hippie-inheels.com/family-vacation-in-toronto-things-to-do/,canada,"A family vacation in Toronto – I think the reasons mid-western families go south are that 1) it’s familiar 2) it’s hot 3) we miss the ocean. Plus, if you haven’t been to Chicago or NYC, you might think going to Montreal or Toronto sounds scary or like it’d get too confusing trying to get around. Toronto is the 4th largest city in North America, but honestly you can’t tell because it’s so spread out. In case you’re curious the top 3 in population are Mexico City, NYC, and LA. We went for 3 days and 3 nights and had a blast. There is so much to do in the city and there’s even a beach for SUP and boating/fishing on Lake Ontario. That’s a good way to talk your dad into going! Going to Toronto is great because it’s an international trip and you get to see lots of cultures all in one place. Stats say that 50% of people in Toronto are born outside Canada, with over 130 languages spoken in Toronto. There is a Little Italy, Little Portugal, China Town, Little India and more plus international markets and huge museums with artifacts from all over the world to explore. Things to do on a family vacation in Toronto (Prices on everything will be in Canadian dollars as the exchange rate is always changing.) 1. The ROM The Royal Ontario Museum was a very cool place to stop by. We only stayed two hours because it was such a gorgeous sunny day to be outside. It’s open 10 am to 5:30 pm and later on weekends. Absolutely worth a visit with artifacts from all over the world. For the special exhibitions you do have to pay extra than the general admission ticket. Price: Tickets for adults at $17 and $14 for children, although they have discounts on Fridays. Getting there: 100 Queens Park. It’s on the intersection of Avenue and Bloor, easily walkable if you’re staying on that side, or you can take the metro to the museum stop. 2. CN Tower The CN Tower is the 2nd tallest building in the world at 447 meters high and shows great views from the city. We went at night and it was pretty cool. You can eat up there but we just had a look and went back down. Price: $35 for adults, $25 for children for general admission Getting there: 301 Front St W. Most likely you can walk here from your hotel. 3. St. Lawrence Market The St. Lawrence market was ranked by Nat Geo as the best in the world. I did expect it to be a bit bigger! It was really cool, easy to see it all, and partially indoors. The thing to try is the peameal sandwich which is a Canadian specialty (get the honey mustard on it). I’ll tell you which places we tried later in the article. Price: free to enter Getting there: 92-95 Front Street East. Take the metro to Union or King Station on the University line and you can walk from there. 4. Evergreen Brick Works See where Toronto was built, literally. The bricks for most of the major buildings came from here. You can have lunch, rent a bike, take a hike and bring your dog along. It’s also called Don Valley Brick Works or Weston Quarry. A local told us this is her favorite place in the city. Price: free to enter Getting there: 550 Bayview Ave. Take the green metro line out to Broadview then walk to your left to a bus stop where a neon shuttle will pick you up for free and take you, every 30 minutes.  5. Eat International food We tried all kinds of restaurants! You can get EVERY nationality of food here. I’ll share just some of the places we tried. Chinese at Luckee Restaurant (328 Wellington St). This was our big dinner out as it’s a little bit pricey. There were 3 of us so we ate quite a lot! We tried their famous starters: chicken Cheung fun, steamed spinach, Chinese celery dumplings, and Taro &amp; turnip cake. For mains we had the bakes soy cod with green beans, the very famous duck with Chinese pancakes, and the beef tenderloin. The beef was so tender and the duck was delicious. I know Ben was really bummed to miss this meal! We don’t usually eat “real” Chinese food so most of the dishes were totally new to us. We liked it all, although the textures took some getting used to. For dessert we tried the passionfruit &amp; pineapple coconut pudding and rice donut. We loved the pudding. The chef here, Chef Lee, is a judge on chopped and very famous. Italian at Pizzeria Libretto (221 Ossington Ave or other locations). The rice balls (arancini) were better than the pizza in my opinion, and they were delicious. The pizza was really good but I guess I don’t get what all the fuss is about with this famous place. It’s real Italian style, and tasty but nothing to go nuts over. Canadian at   Paddington’s at St. Lawrence Market. We had the most scrumptious juicy turkey sandwich outside the market and tried the burger with peameal bacon. Canadian at  Carousel Bakery . at St. Lawrence Market. We tried the peameal sandwich here which is probably the most famous place to have it. Polish on the street. Go ahead and get a hotdog or Polish sausage from anywhere between 3-6 bucks on the streets. Canadian/American at Jack Astor’s (chain restaurant). We wanted a good burger but all the famous little joints were packed for the Pan Am games, so we went here to a popular chain restaurant. The food was great. Local beer at Mill St. Brewery . My parents tried the one on tap, the Mill Street Pilsner. One of the famous beers we saw in Toronto was Steamwhistle which we had at other places. Chocolate at SOMA Chocolatemaker in the Distillery district. They had gelato, homemade chocolates, and nuts. My parents bought the spicy pecans and they were so good.  6. Kensington Market Vintage shopping and food from all over the world can be found at Kensington Market . Everyone on my Instagram said to go, but we just didn’t have enough time! It’s one of the things we wish we had done. Everyone says to check out the “Pedestrian Sunday market” there. Price: free to enter Getting there: Kensington Road. From University metro, take the Dundas streetcar west, and get off at Spadina. 7. Shop Queen Street West Surprise, surprise this is the first thing we did. We had some beer between shopping at the famous H orseshoe Tavern and looked in shops like LUSH, Lululemon, American Apparel, Urban Outfitters, lots of boutiques and hipster shops, and coffee shops. Man, the 90’s are so in style! Price: depends how much of a shopper you are ;) Getting there: Queen Street West. You can walk from most places downtown or take University metro to Osgoode. 8. Visit the Beaches “The Beaches ” was great to walk around in the early morning. We were meant to have a SUP class but got stood up. Bummer! But we still enjoyed seeing the area and to be honest, the water was a bit too cold anyways. There were so many cute dogs being walked! Perfect people watching place, if you’re a creep like me. Price: free Getting there: we drove, jumped on the Gardiner Expressway to Lakeshore Blvd, about 15 minutes. There was a lot of street parking. 9. Grab a drink where the Rolling Stones play The Horseshoe Tavern on Queen West is pretty famous and the Rolling Stones do surprise performances. The Police, Ramones, and Conway Twitty have all played here. Price: typical Getting there: 370 Queen West.  You can walk from most places downtown or take University metro to Osgoode. 10. Shop &amp; in Greek Town Greektown is easy to hit up on your way out to Brick Works (#4 on this list) because it’s just near Broadview metro stop. We walked around here after we got off the shuttle from Brick Works. There are loads of restaurants and shops. Price: free Getting there: Danforth Ave. You can take the green line out to Broadview. 11. Check out City Hall City Hall or Nathan Phillips Square tends to have a lot going on. We were there during the Pan Am games, so stumbled into a couple of concerts. Check out the website to see what’s happening while you’re in town. Price: free Getting there: You can probably walk. It’s at the Osgoode stop on the yellow (University line) at Queen Street and University intersection.  12. Distillery District This was my favorite part of Toronto! The Distillery District is a brick lane with old buildings full of vintage treasure and boutique shops. We loved SOMA chocolate and Mill St. Brewery and all the shops were very cool and trendy although expensive. Price: free Getting there: Mill St. We took a taxi here but you could walk from the Union Station stop, although it’s quite far, maybe 35 minutes. You would pass St. Lawrence market on the way. 13. See a Show We considered seeing Kinky Boots but it online only found tickets at $350 per person so we didn’t go. They have 4 theaters playing shows and options were Motown, Newsies, Phantom of the Opera and more. It’s a big “thing to do” in Toronto, but I guess we should have planned ahead more. Price: in my experience, it was quite expensive Getting there: There are four theatres so you’d have to buy tickets, then look up the theatre on maps. 14. Sports! There wasn’t anything going on while we were there, but our hotel was right outside the Air Canada Center where the Toronto Maple Leafs play hockey. You could also catch a Blue Jays baseball game at Rogers Centre (which also has concerts). Price: I’m not sure the best place to book sports in Toronto Getting there: Air Canada Center is just of the Union station metro stop, you can’t miss it and the Rogers Centre is on 1 Blue Jays Way. 15. Hockey Hall of Fame If you’re really into hockey, this is worth a mention although we aren’t huge Hockey people and didn’t go to the Hockey Hall of Fame  on this trip. Price: according to the website it’s $18 for adults and $12 for children Getting there: 30 Yonge St. We passed this on our way walking to St. Lawrence market. You can walk from downtown or take the metro to Union or King and walk from there. For the kids: 16, 17, &amp; 18. Casa Loma, Science Center, and Zoo I’ve put these together because we didn’t go for a variety of reasons, although they are famous attractions in Toronto. Casa Loma is a mansion you can tour, the Science Center we were advised was best for children, and I’m not crazy about Zoos. You can find more information about all of these on the Toronto Tourism website . Just because I didn’t go doesn’t mean they aren’t great options, especially for kids! 19. Take a Street Car The 501 street car “red rocket” is a famous way of getting around the city. It goes along Dundas Road. We took this to get out to Ossington. You can ask your hotel for a metro map or print one online and you’ll see the getting around is very easy and you can walk almost everywhere if you’re not into taking street cars or metros. 20. Stay Downtown There are SO many hotel options downtown, even a Holiday Inn, that you can surely find something in your budget. Driving to Toronto from Ohio was easy and the Highways are really organized with a HOV lane for 3+ people. Even with the Pan Am games we didn’t get into any bad traffic. Parking is expensive so it’s best to leave your car rather than take it out and pay over and over, or valet so you can have multiple take outs with no extra charge. We stayed at both the Le Germain Maple Leaf Square and the Four Seasons."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2015/09/off-the-beaten-path-destinations-china/,china,"5 Lesser-Known but Must-Visit Places in China Where I’m from, when you say traveling to China, it means touring one of these five cities: Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Guangzhou. Outside the travel circles and blogging communities, only a few have heard of other Chinese destinations. Everything else can already be considered “off-the-beaten-path.” But if there’s one thing that my journey from Guilin to Zhangjiajie has taught me, it’s that this vast, vast country has a gazillion surprises tucked in its provinces. We asked travel and food enthusiast Wai Zhou, co-founder of Eating Adventures Food Tours , for other marvelous places in China that every explorer must experience. She has traveled extensively throughout the country with a particular interest in Yunnan, Guangdong and Xinjiang provinces. Here are her recommendations, words and photos by her.       WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Wan Feng Lin (10,000 peaks) in Guizhou Province 2.

Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Far Western China Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Wan Feng Lin (10,000 peaks) in Guizhou Province Wan Feng Lin, which means “ten thousand peaks”, is a collection of around 20,000 karst peak formations that stretch over a length of 200km in southern China. We stumbled across this near Xingyi in Guizhou province during one of our overnight stops on a leisurely train adventures between Guangzhou and Kunming. Like most Chinese tourist sites, the government has a very well set up and structured way of viewing the site, with shuttle buses taking loads of domestic tourists to and from the viewing point. Not being fond of sticking with the hordes of tourists, we decided to follow a dirt path that weaved through some small farms and then up into the mountains. Wan Feng Lin Wan Feng Lin The walk through the farms immediately connected us to another world, with friendly old ladies attending to their crops, local people drying chillies outside their front doors and keeping pigs near their homes. A family was building their new home – it was mansion by Western standards. We started walking up one of these peaks. For a long time, we did not see anything of interest. Just when we were about to turn back, we persisted a little longer and arrived at a small Buyi village hidden between the peaks. Most of the Buyi people live in Guizhou province. They have their own language and normally live in small villages and work as farmers. We saw a young man in front of a simple old house and yelled out “Ni Hao” which means “hello” a few times but he didn’t turn around. We thought what unfriendly locals! Then the young man turned around and we could see the surprise and delight in his face. He ran into the house to grab his elderly parents. They invited us into the house and insisted we stay for lunch. We witnessed true hospitality from these people who live such simple lives themselves. We found out later that the young man was mute and deaf. How to get there: Xingyi is on the train line from Guangzhou to Kunming.From Xingyi, take bus no.19 (40 minutes) or take a taxi to Wan Feng Lin (costs around CNY35)Entry fee: CNY80 (Shuttle bus ride extra CNY50)Opening hours : 8:00 – 18:00Contact number : 0859-3342299 2. Shangri-La in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province Shangri-la City, China Shangri-la is a fictional place featured in Lost Horizon, a novel written in 1933 by British author James Hilton. He describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains. Shangri-La is actually a Tibetan word which means “sacred and peaceful land.” People associate the word to an unearthly paradise, a utopia. In 1996, the search for Shangri-La in Yunnan province began. In 1997, the Yunnan government declared they have found this utopia in Zhongdian. Zhongdian was then formerly renamed to current Shangri-La in 2001 to attract more tourists. With many snow-capped mountains and glaciers, hundreds of alpine lakes, gorges and meadows, I think it is well worth the title. When we arrived Shangri-La town, we felt the effect of Shangri-La has instantly. We were more relaxed but could not think properly. We felt a bit light-headed and sleepy. Well, that was probably due to the high altitude – Shangri-La is 3450m above sea level. The town itself is very interesting with a large Tibetan population. You see groups of Tibetan women dressed in traditional dresses with their bright pink hair wraps shopping together, all carrying a basket on their back and snuff in their hands. We saw Tibetan men running antique shops, where you can find Tibetan prayer flags and prayer wheels to silver snuff boxes, mingling with other locals. We were expecting the Tibetan monks to be simple vegetarians and do not indulge in the materialistic world. However, we saw them driving nice four-wheel drives, smoking, talking on their fancy mobiles and eating meat in the best restaurants in town. While we were in this restaurant enjoying our yak hotpot, we saw a group of monks and out of curiosity we asked the waitress what the monks were eating. She replied “Everything! Same as you.” Just 5km outside town, there is a big Tibetan monastery called Gadan Songzanlin Monastry. It is the biggest Tibetan monastery in Yunnan province. Built in 1679, it is often referred to as “Little Potala Palace”. If you are not visiting Tibet and are interested in seeing a Tibetan monastery, it is worth a visit. The best way to explore and enjoy the beauty of Shangri-La is by hiring a bicycle and start riding away from the town. You are not going to only ride through beautiful meadows and lakes but you will meet a lot of friendly locals. On the day we went riding, it was raining and the local Tibetan invited us into his house for a tea to get out of the rain. We helped out some locals who were trying to move a log and we got invited into their grand Tibetan house, an impressive two storey structure elaborately decorated with Tibetan wooden carvings with the tea making stove at the centre of their living room. Shangri-La is living museum with so much to offer. How to get there: You can fly into Diqing Shangri-La Airport from Beijing, Chengdu, Kunming, Lhasa, Shanghai and Chongqing.However, most people will be coming from Lijiang. From Lijiang, you can either take a bus (4 hours) or hire a car with driver to take you to Shangri-La.Bicycle rental : There are several places to hire bicycles or mountain bikes in town. Please check the condition of the bikes carefully.Songzanlin Monastry : 5 kilometres north of town. You can either take bus no. 3 or a taxi (CNY10). Entry fee is CNY115. Open from 7:30 – 18:30.

There are 13 peaks in total and Shanzidou is the highest peak with an altitude of 5596m. It stretches 35km long and 20km wide. It is the southern-most glacier in the Northern Hemisphere. As such, you can experience scenery from a Subtropical zone, Temperate zone to Frigid Zone all in one place. It is also a holy place for the Naxi people who lives in this region. There are few scenic spots in the area. The most important experience is undoubtedly the trip on the Long Ropeway. The Long Ropeway departs from an elevation of 3356m. We were there in September and the temperature was not too low and quite pleasant. However, I can imagine in winter, you probably want to hire one of their thick down jackets before going up the ropeway. We weren’t sure how we will cope with the high altitude so we bought a small tank of oxygen each to bring with us. Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Jade Dragon Snow Mountain The ropeway took us from an elevation of 3356m to 4506m and the scenery changed very quickly. At the bottom, we could still see green vegetation but they quickly turned into barren charcoal colour mountain faces with glaciers embedded in the valleys, sometimes hidden behind clouds. When we got off the ropeway, we walked up the wooden path to an altitude of 4680m right into the glacier. At the top, you can see a shrine from the Naxi people’s religion standing strong in the wind. Ganhaizi (Dry Sea) situates at the foot of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. It is a beautiful meadow formed after an alpine lake dried up. You will see local shepherds herding their yaks, sheep and cows in the meadow in spring. At an altitude of 2900m there is also a wide variety of plants. From here, you can see the full view of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain with all its 13 peaks in sight. After a long day in the mountain, head back to Lijiang town to enjoy a donkey meat hot pot. There is a saying in Chinese “There is dragon meat in heaven and there is donkey meat on earth.” It is full of protein and low in fat and cholesterol. It claims to cure back pain too! How to get there: Best to charter a taxi there for CNY100-200 a day. There are public buses from Red Sun Square (Hong Tai Yang Square) in Lijiang which cost CNY15 per person. Entry fee: CNY125 to enter the scenic areaCNY180 to take the cable to the highest pointOxygen tanks are also for sale at CNY50 per tank and you can hire down jackets also.CNY80 entrance fee to Ganhaizi Opening hours: 7:30 – 16:00Contact number: 0888-5161501 5. Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Far Western China Xinjiang, China Officially it is part of China but it is located in far western China which borders Russia and all the “stan” countries, it feels like a world away. Think Chinese temples replaced by grand old mosques, motorcycles replaced by donkey carts and lamb on the menu instead of pork. One other thing that is hard to get used to is the time difference. Here they still run on Beijing time, however, geographically it is about 2 hours behind Beijing so the sun sets here at around 10pm in summer. Xinjiang is the largest province in China and it is mostly populated by the Uyghur minority people who are a Turkic ethnic group and believe in Islam. They have their own Turkic language but also speak Chinese with a thick accent. Their cuisine is of Central-Asian style distinctly different from other Chinese cuisines. The capital, Urumqi is a busy, bustling city. You can see kebab stands and outdoor lamb butchers everywhere. Fruit vendors selling the best looking melons you have ever seen. Freshly baked naans coming out from the round stone ovens and shops selling Islamic skull caps. A short flight will take you to Kuche where suddenly cars are replaced by donkey carts. We visited a mosque in Kuche old town. The keeper there was very welcoming and friendly. We were the only people there and he showed us around the mosque. We were invited into a small room at the back where he proudly showed us an Islamic book dated back in 1298. In any other countries, this book would be kept behind glass in a museum but this book just sat in the open and we were allowed to carefully flip through it. We also held the leather baton which was used for enforcing Sharia law punishments in the past. From Kuche, we took the slow train to Kashgar. This train is really basic with open windows and wooden benches but the friendly locals made the train trip felt short and much more tolerable. When we checked into our hotel in Kashgar, I opened the windows and my breath was taken away. Just behind our modern hotel, there lies an old town with sand-coloured brick houses that stretches as far as I can see. We took a walk into town and realised it was Friday afternoon. We heard calls to prayers and flocks of worshippers were heading to the biggest mosque in China, the Ida Kah Mosque. All the women had their faces totally covered with a thick brown cotton cloth so not even their eyes were showing. Xinjiang, China No visit to Kashgar is complete without going to the Sunday Livestock Market. Truckloads of fat-tailed sheep, goats, donkeys and cows are being transported to the market from early morning. When I say “truck”, I am referring to both real trucks and donkey “trucks” and it is hard to find a “car-parking” spot here. There are a lot of activities going on – traders inspecting the sheep, buyers and sellers haggling on the price, buyers test-riding the horses at the back of the market and locals taking a break from business to get a shave and a hair-cut in the open. How to get there: Urumqi the capital is connected by direct flights from most major cities in China as well as international flights Moscow, Almaty, Istanbul and other Central Asia cities. There are direct flights from Urumqi to Kuche and Kashgar. There are also trains connecting Urumqi all the way to Kashgar which takes around 20 hours. Kuche is about half way between Urumqi and Kashgar. A note on security : There has been some security concerns in Xinjiang in recent years. Please check your own government’s website for up to date security warnings before going to Xinjiang."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/08/kaifeng-china-itinerary-things-to-do-day-tour/,china,"Kaifeng, China: 5 Things to Do in a Day (Our Itinerary) To say that I didn’t know much about Kaifeng would be sugarcoating it. The truth is, I didn’t even know this city has existed until I was already there.       Where I’m from, Kaifeng is unheard of. It is not mentioned in our history textbooks. We don’t see it in the news. Much of what we know about China is limited mostly to Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong (and our ongoing dispute on the Spratlys). It’s no wonder that in Kaifeng, every sight I beheld was a surprise. Every turn I made was an enlightenment. Yet, it somehow felt strangely familiar: good street food, historical temples, a thick language barrier, and the warmth of the locals. I may have been unfamiliar with Kaifeng, but it is an important city to the Chinese. It is one of China’s eight ancient capitals, being the political, economic, and cultural center during the Song Dynasty (960-1127). But its roots can be traced back to over 2700 years ago, making it one of the earliest continuously inhabited settlements in China. Unfortunately, we only had a full day to explore this historic city. Here are the places we were able to visit. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Get Acquainted with an Icon at Lord Bao Temple. 2. Go Back in Time at the Millennium City Park. 3. Song Royal Street 4. Sample Local Delicacies. 5. Forage the Drum Tower Night Market. Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Get Acquainted with an Icon at Lord Bao Temple. Lord Bao Temple A household name in China, Lord Bao Zheng (or Bao Gong) was a government official who was in position during the reign of Song Dynasty’s Emperor Renzong. Over his years of service, he demonstrated fairness and honesty by prosecuting even the rich and powerful and sentencing his own uncle, so much so that he has become the icon for incorruptible justice. In Kaifeng, where Lord Bao served, stands a memorial built in his honor. The temple complex has a number of buildings that house an exhibition hall, a second temple, and a room showcasing a wax figure of Lord Bao and a scene from one of the legends about him involving copper and bronze guillotines. 2. Go Back in Time at the Millennium City Park. Also known as Qingming Riverside Landscape, the Millennium City Park recreates a famous painting by Song Dynasty realist artist Zhang Zeduan called “Riverside Scene.” Think of it as a theme park with lessons on history and culture on every turn. Instead of rides, you are introduced to the local way of life back in the day. Instead of action-packed stunt show, you are treated to ancient forms of entertainment including chair-gripping stunt performances. At the Millennium City Park At the Millennium City Park At the Millennium City Park At the Millennium City Park A stall vendor playing a board game. 3. Song Royal Street Due to time constraints, we drove on this street without making a stop, so, uhm, yeah we practically skipped this place. (We took too much time eating!) Built in 1988 to mimic the real Royal Street during the Northern Song Dynasty, it showcases the architectural styles of that era along 400 meters of over 50 stores selling handicrafts, paintings and local products. 4. Sample Local Delicacies. Kaifeng’s unique qualities also show in its cuisine, adding twist to some Chinese classics including the “Carp on Noodles,” which is basically sweet and sour fish wrapped in noodles; Steamed Stuffed Buns, which is a bigger and thicker-doughed version of the famous xiao long bao; Almond Tea Soup, a dessert-ish soup which, according to our guide, is made from almonds, sunflower seeds, apricot, and sesame seeds, and topped with sprinkles (Don’t worry. I’m confused, too); and Donkey Meat Soup, a soup with donkey meat as the main ingredient. Carp wrapped in noodles. Kaifeng-style steamed stuffed buns 5. Forage the Drum Tower Night Market. Save the best for last. Our little food trip around the Drum Tower Night Market was definitely the highlight of our day (primarily because I’m a pig and I love street food). Situated at Gulou Square, surrounding the Drum Tower, Kaifeng’s Night Market has a lot to boast. Not only is it one of the oldest night markets in China, it is also the only one in Henan Province that is open year-round, even in winter. There’s a lot to sample here, with snacks being the top priority. From global crowd-pleasers like fresh oysters to local favorites like Kaifeng-style xiao long bao to the more unusual acquired tastes like grilled cicadas and scorpions, this has everything a foodie would consider stuffing their face. Colorful desserts like yogurt and iced fruit mixtures are also available. Along one street, the food stalls turn into kiosks selling clothes, toys, and trinkets. It was pretty crowded during our visit. Fresh oysters. Some fried bread. Fried Tofu Scorpions on Stick. Who wants to try? Waiting for customers Kaifeng Drum Tower Snack kiosks just adjacent the Drum Tower. More treats on stick! "https://hippie-inheels.com/9-hiking-trails-that-offer-the-best-views-of-hong-kong/,china,"9 Lesser Known Hiking Trails That Offer the Best Views of Hong Kong I have mentioned hiking as one of the top 5 things to do in Hong Kong because it has some of the best urban hiking trails in the world. What do I mean by urban hiking trails? It means they are close to the city and offers a spectacular view of them, in this case the best views of Hong Kong. You might be impressed by the views from Rio De Janeiro and Table Mountain of South Africa, but Hong Kong’s hiking trails not only offer awesome views, there are plenty of them and most aren’t that hard to hike. If I don’t convince you to pack your hiking shoes to Hong Kong with this post when you visit, then I don’t know what will! Finding the Best Views of Hong Kong While on a Hike! Suicide Cliff (Kowloon Peak) This is taken from the trail looking down – not by a drone! If you want a spectacular city backdrop against a rock platform, then look no further than Suicide Cliff en route up Kowloon Peak. In fact, a photo taken here has won a 19-year-old a National Geography photography competition. While it is beautiful in the daytime, it’s even more so at night when the city lights up. Hong Kong seen from the top of Kowloon at Suicide Cliff The name Suicide Cliff comes from the almost vertical cliff face that makes it even more dramatic. As part of the trail that goes up to the highest peak in Kowloon, one requires a certain level of fitness and preparation to conquer this hike. If you are interested in how to hike this, I have a detailed night hike up Suicide Cliff guide .   High Junk Peak High Junk Peak on a clear day! Number three on the three sharp peaks of Sai Kung, High Junk Peak is the easiest one to hike and you get to see all of Sai Kung at the top. Located in the Sai Kung region near Clear Water Bay, you see more nature than city along here. Its highest point offers a clear view of the golf course and Ninepin Islands from afar. In fact, it would almost feel like you are not in Hong Kong at all! The tallest building in the far distance middle is IFC. Lion Rock Mountain can just be made out on the right, the third with a slight kink. One of my favourite view of this hike is that of the whole of Kowloon and part of Hong Kong Island from the first stretch of the trail. You can see the Lion Rock Mountain, IFC, and the Victoria Harbour – though it looks a lot smaller in photos.   Lion Rock Mountain Lion Rock has a close up cityscape view of Kowloon! The Lion Rock Mountain is a popular trail in Hong Kong since it is the symbol of Hong Kongese’s spirits. While I prefer the view of Suicide Cliff, Lion Rock Mountain is an easier climb and a lot closer to the city. It also offers a clear view of Kowloon on its highest points and a hotspot for rock climbers. It’s a must hike for many because of its symbolism and ease.   MacLehose Trail Stage 4 How can you resist this view? It’s the Sai Kung sea! By far one of my most favourite hikes, the MacLehose Trail Stage 4 runs from Sai Kung to Ma On Shan. The first hour of the trail is boring, but the reward when you reach the viewpoint is great. You get to see the view of Sai Kung and Shatin and the scenery gets even wider when you reach the ridge before the Pyramid Hill. On the weekend, you can even catch some paragliders drifting in the sky. In fact, Sai Kung is a great area to hike in general! For more hikes around Sai Kung, you can see them on my Hong Kong hiking page .   Devil’s Peak We are now looking towards Hong Kong Island from the east In the western part of Kowloon on the Wilson Trail Stage 3 is the Devil’s Peak and its abandon fortress. Because it’s right by the coastline, you get a closer view of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon than from High Junk Peak. Its view also comprises of less wilderness and more cityscape. You can find a lot of rocks either side of the trail to take shots from, we certainly pop all over the place on our visit.   Twins Peak The endless stairways down towards Stanley. Despite the weather, we could still see the peninsular clearly! Despite the brutal thousand steps of stairs that are required to conquer the top of the peak, many still choose the hike the Twins Peak. Why? Because it gives you a completely unobstructed view of the Stanley peninsula. Part of the Wilson Trail Stage 1, the Twins Peak amounts to the equivalent of 60 storey’s staircase. So you best get your keen brace on if you want to hike this beast.   Dragon’s Back Facing the village of Shek O, Dragon’s Back is an easy hike suitable for beginners! The award-winning urban trail is the most popular trail on Hong Kong Island because of its view and ease to hike. One can’t deny the beauty of a ridge trail and the view of Shek O. However, it gets overcrowded on a weekend. So if you hate hiking in a queue, then try to go on a weekday.   Sunset Peak Hiking the Sunset Peak around November means you’ll hit silver grass season! Less strenuous than the Lantau Peak, Sunset Peak on Lantau Island is beautiful in fall when the silver grass bloom across the entire mountain top. Again, hiking to the top involves a lot of stairs and its popularity means many people heads there unprepared. It is the best place to admire the silver grass and if you have the time to spare, go further up to Lantau Peak to camp overnight to view the sunrise the next day.   Pineapple Mountain A landscape that’s not often found in Hong Kong and reminiscent of Grand Canyon! Technically not a hiking trail since it’s well paved most of the time, the Pineapple Mountain in Tuen Mum is the shortest hike on the list. It also stays on one path only and aside from being very hilly in the beginning is easy to get to. It is dubbed as the Grand Canyon of Hong Kong with its weathered surface and sandy ground, however, it is a lot smaller than it looks. The weathering of the hill makes this a unique landscape not found often in anywhere else in Hong Kong If you have been to somewhere similar then chances are this won’t impress you. But since it’s unique in Hong Kong which is made of mostly igneous rock. Since it’s so far in New Territories, when I went hiking there I ended up eating in the Yuen Long town center, too."https://hippie-inheels.com/guide-to-hong-kong-best-hidden-eateries/,china,"You’ve Got Me Wonton More: A Guide to Hong Kong’s Best Hidden Eateries Hong Kong has an overwhelming amount of choice for a quick bite to eat, but with this guide to Hong Kong’s best hidden eateries, we’re letting you in on all the secrets. guide to Hong Kong’s best hidden eateries I frowned at the mystery meat floating in my broth and looked at my friend, Jeff, questioningly. He shook his head and smirked, and I steeled myself to take a nibble. Ah – pig lung. An unpleasant chewy texture, accompanied by a violent urge to spit it out again immediately. We were in Jeff’s favorite restaurant, in Kowloon Bay, eating a selection of popular classic local dishes. Apart from the pig lung broth, we were tucking into some delicious crispy fried white fish with a chili sauce, soft tofu seasoned with salted fish, steamed water cabbage with soy sauce and a big tub of steamed white rice. The rice is served with a tall glass of lard that you spoon into your bowl and then mix with soy sauce. The whole meal was basically a heart attack waiting to happen! But as with most unhealthy things, it was unbelievably delicious (well…apart from the pig lung!). The restaurant itself was packed, filled with chatter, arguments, and laughter – so much so that we basically had to shout to hear each other. A classic Hong Kong scene. 粗菜館Tso Choi Restaurant , G/F 17A Nga Tsin Wai Rd, Kowloon City To truly visit Hong Kong, you need to see it through what it is best known for – it’s food. There is a wealth of variety and deliciousness in the cuisines available here. Although visitors should beware that traditional Cantonese food is known for its utilization of every part of the animal, which can bring up some interesting dishes! In my quest to find the best truly local Hong Kong eateries I enlisted the help of 3 local foodies; Jeff, Justin, and Chia. I asked each of them to take me to their best-loved restaurant, to try their favorite dishes – leaving myself entirely in their hands. The second must-visit eatery is in Tai Po Market, deep in the New Territories. Justin assured me that their famed clay rice bowls are well worth the long journey. Clay rice bowls are a Cantonese delicacy, dating back almost 2000 years, where rice is slow cooked in clay bowls with dried meats that infuse their flavor. There is a constant queue for the restaurant, so I would recommend getting there early if you’re going for dinner (aim for 6ish). You order while waiting in line, for maximum efficiency – we ordered a cured meat pot and a beef pot. We were soon settled in and ordered our starters; rice noodle rolls (cheong fun) with bbq meat and the seemingly ubiquitous Cantonese mystery meat broth. The cheong fun served with sweet soy sauce was the best I had ever tasted – the perfect mix of sweet, salty and sticky. The mystery meat turned out to be beef tripe and pig intestines. After intense internal debate, I once again bullied myself into trying a bowl. The chewy texture of the tripe was unpleasant to begin with, but the taste was so good that I was soon able to overlook it and wolf it down. The intestines were a whole other story and were left untouched. Then came the clay pots. The beef pot was served with a raw egg cracked over it that was cooked by the heat of the rice. Tasty, but nothing extraordinary. The star of the show was definitely the cured meat pot. Cooked with sweet Cantonese sausage, salted duck and bbq pork, the rice had soaked up all that salty, oily goodness. There was fierce competition for seconds and no hope for thirds! 陳漢記 Chan Hon Kee –  G/F, No. 91B Wan Tau Street, Tai Po The next day we came to my favorite eatery, chosen by Chia. Concealed in the back streets of Sham Shui Po, with not another non-Chinese face to be seen, this little dai pai dong (open air food stall) was overflowing with character. The kitchen was set up on the road with tables and chairs taking up the sidewalk surrounding it. Chia, my sister Katie, and I grabbed a table near the kitchen and ordered dishes entirely based on the waitress’s recommendations – although Katie firmly vetoed the stir fried seafood intestines (I was so glad to have brought along someone significantly less adventurous than myself!). While we waited for our food we washed our bowls, plates, and chopsticks in the hot tea provided. This wasn’t a reflection on the cleanliness of the place, it is a custom performed in all traditional restaurants – typically by the youngest of your party. After only a couple of minutes, a large plate of steamed ginger chicken arrived, served with a deliciously salty ginger sauce. This was closely followed by a plate of piping hot, deep fried battered white fish with a soy-vinegar dip, and stir fried kailan with steamed squid. All the dishes were shared and disappeared speedily down our gullets while we caught up, shared stories and people watched. The best thing about this dai pai dong? Watching the sun go down over the city, the streetlights and neons signs light up and knowing you’re right at the heart of it all. 強記大排檔 , G/F, No. 219 Kei Lung Street, Sham Shui Po As you’ve probably guessed, this foodie exploration is not for the faint-stomached. Had it not been for my local foodies accompanying me, I doubt I would have been able to find these places myself.  However, despite all the restaurants being in a totally Chinese environment, each of these places has either an English menu, or a picture menu that you can point at (so you don’t have to worry about accidentally ordering 5 plates of chicken brains).  Each of them is worth visiting not only for their food but also for their uniquely Hong Kong setting. It really is adventure at its best – through the stomach!"https://hippie-inheels.com/things-to-do-in-hong-kong/,china,"Hong Kong is known as the Pearl of the Orient and a mix of Eastern and Western world.

It has a huge statue of Tian Tan Buddha (which means “Giant Buddha”). The statue is about 85 feet (or 26m) in height. This place is well connected by roadways as well as railways. So, getting there is not a problem. This place is accessible and open to all outsiders between 10am to 5:30pm (local time). Day 6: Hiking At Dragon’s Back Ridge On the sixth day, pack your backpack and head towards one of the most exciting parts of the trip. If you are crazy about hiking, then nothing can be better than the spectacular hiking trails . For exploring the natural beauty of Hong Kong, this is the best time. Day 7: Don’t Miss Their Cuisine And Street Food If you visit Hong Kong and do not try their authentic Chinese cuisine and street food, then your trip to Hong Kong will remain incomplete. You can try different options of Chinese cuisines which are delicious. You can also try their teas, as tea is a big part of the local culture. Don’t miss an opportunity to try dim sum and fried morning glories for a great food experience. Now it is time to bid goodbye to the awesome memories that you will create in Hong Kong. So, make sure to make the most of your one week Hong Kong itinerary. You can leave for Macau after Hong Kong is done. It is called the Monte Carlo of the Orient. It has a big casino industry and if you love casinos then this is the best place. It is one of the China’s Special Administrative Regions other than Hong Kong. It is also famous as one of the best gambling destinations in Asia. To reach Macau you can take a ferry from Hong Kong which will take an hour to reach your destination."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-chengdu/,china,"Chengdu is the largest nearby city, only 90 minutes away by the high speed train. I loved teaching in a smaller area, but I frequently escaped to Chengdu to relax and explore. Sichuan as a whole is a more adventurous place to travel so being in Chengdu is the ideal time to enjoy a bit of luxury before diving into the next adventure. I love Sichuan fiercely and Chengdu really is the heart of it all. What makes Chengdu a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?   While many westerners may not have even heard of Chengdu it is one of the largest cities in China, located in western part of the country, its often considered the “last outpost” before you get into much less developed areas. As a city it has one of the highest qualities of life in China, with lower levels of pollution, easy access to many beautiful areas and amazing food. Unlike many other Chinese cities, it’s pretty relaxed and has attracted many foreigners. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? If you’re going to splurge in Chengdu I would do it at the BuddhaZen hotel , the third highest ranked hotel in Chengdu. A breakfast is included with the room, which has a western breakfast so you won’t need to eat spicy rice noodles in the morning. The place is decorated in a traditional Chinese style and it is located on a pedestrian road so you won’t hear constant traffic. It also tends to be surrounded by food vendors so you can get a delicious snack while coming/going and they have an in-house spa. Its located across the street next to the Wenshua monastery. I have visited that temple frequently as it is an incredibly peaceful place. In the rush of modern Chinese life its definitely worth walking through their garden area to relax. Admission is free. What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Loft is a boutique hostel in Chengdu , located near the city center. Its a fun and quirky place but very comfortable. They offer a free meal to guests once a week and will often teach you come Chinese cooking skills if you ask nicely. Holly’s Hostel also a good choice, though a bit less cozy. It is a Tibetan place with a rooftop café and is located right in the center of the Tibetan District, so you’ll be able to try some butter tea and buy some Tibetan jewelry. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? Chengdu is often a base for adventurous travelers, people heading out to Tibet, or to the mountainous Northern areas of Sichuan. Those are often a day long bus ride away but if you want to stay in the area then going to climb QingCheng shan is just a 30 minute train ride away. You can take cable cars to the top and walk down or hike the whole way but it is a really lovely area and a famous Taoist mountain. If you’re looking for a longer trip I always recommend people check out Juizhaigou for the bluest water you’ll ever see. If you’re not interested in a 10 hour bus ride you can fly there from Chengdu and make it a day trip after all. Where are the best hang outs during the day? Pandas are largely considered the number one thing to do in Chengdu. There are over 50 pandas (including the very cute red ones). Even if you’re not an animal person, its a really nice place to walk around. Go as early in the morning as you can, almost every hotel/hostel will arrange a ride for you. In the mornings the pandas are eating and they’re ridiculously cute. You can also pay to cuddle a baby panda if that’s a dream of yours. If you haven’t been in China long then I would suggest going over to the park (Renmin Park) and just walk around. The park is lovely but what is most entertaining is the number of people you will see dancing, singing, writing calligraphy, doing Tai Chi. Mornings are best for this. There are also a lot of teahouses so you can relax with endless cups of green tea and wait out the heat during the summer afternoons. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Chengdu and what are their best dishes? For Western food I’m a big fan of the Bookworm because I’m a huge nerd and I love eating at a place with books in it. They have a huge range of English books for decent prices. Their menu is pretty decent with good salads, a rare find in China. I also like that they mix western/sichuanese ingredients. They have delicious cocktails with book inspired names and I quite enjoy drinking a Gone with the Gin. (2-7 Yujie Donglu, 28 Renmin Nanlu) Sichuan is famous for its food though and you should not come here without trying some its deliciousness. mapo dofu, kung pao chicken, spicy green beans, and fish flavored pork are my favorite dishes. You can read more about Sichuan food here . Even better though, go out for hot pot. Sichuanese hot pot is a vat at your table filled with boiling broth and peppers and you order a wide range of foods to be cooked and eaten. My favorite things to eat in hot pot are cauliflower, lotus roots, mushrooms, quail eggs, shrimp dumplings, and cow stomach. Make sure you try something crazy, you are in China after all. For Sichuanese food try the restaurant Mapo Dofu (2 nd fl, 197 xi Yulong Jie) or better yet, just ask staff at a hostel/hotel and they’ll probably be able to point you to a good place. For hot pot I’d try Yulin Chuanchuan Xiang (2-3 Kehau Jie) Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet?   Chunxi Lu is a famous pedestrian shopping street and the largest one in Sichuan. You can find basically anything here including many western chains. There is a pretty wide range from H&amp;M to Prada. For more designer stuff you can walk along Kehua Road and there are any cute shops, many with a serious middle eastern flair. If you want to buy a Qipao (traditional Chinese silk dress) then try going to Wide and Narrow Alley and be prepared for an audience because Chinese people love seeing foreign women in traditional clothes. I love buying silk scarves here and you will see shops everywhere. Just remember to haggle. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Chengdu? One of my favorite things to do in China is to get my hair washed. It sounds lame, but they’re rub your head and give you a scalp massage which feels amazing. They’ll also clean your ears, and rub your shoulder/neck before they’ll style your hair. I will warn you that if you have curls like me, sometimes the “styling” comes out a bit wonky since they’re not used to it. I would suggest asking your hostel/hotel for a recommendation because there are places everywhere and they’ll know the best ones. Have them write down “hair wash” and “gentle” in characters for you (Chinese like rough massages) If you’re feeling adventurous you can visit a tea house to get your ears cleaned. There will be men walking around clanging chimes together. The cleaning is…. Intense. While it wasn’t painful, it wasn’t exactly pleasant either. It’s very Chinese and interesting experience either way. sunset over lake via flickr Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? While you won’t actually see the sun go down, its definitely good to head over to Jinli alley at night. Its definitely a touristy area selling all sorts of crafts, but you can find some very cute Tibetan jewelry, Chinese traditional paper cuttings, silk scarves, and you can buy a lot of traditional snack foods. Really the highlight is seeing all the Chinese lanterns at night. There are lots of place to get a drink and often there is live music. There are lots of places to eat/drink and often live music. It’s a good place to either end your day or to pre-game for the night ahead. Just beware if any men offer you a glass of “white wine”. Its not wine, its baiju, China’s most infamous alcohol. It can be 100 proof and is definitely an acquired taste. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Jellyfish is Chengdu’s most infamous club and is beloved by expats and travelers. Often there is live music and can be a lot of fun."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-beijing/,china,"Beijing, the bustling capital of China, is the center of Chinese culture and politics. From hiking the Great Wall, to shopping in Sanlitun, there’s so much to do and see in this sprawling city. With delicacies like Peking duck, to cheap street food dumplings, you’ll be sure to leave with a full stomach and a smile on your face. I studied abroad in Beijing a few years ago, and moved back after graduation to teach English. Beijing is one of my favorite cities in China, and is a must-see for any traveler. What makes Beijing a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Beijing is much less expensive than other cosmopolitan cities around the world, meaning you can have a luxury vacation on a budget. Snap a photo of yourself conquering the Great Wall, get pampered with a cheap massage or purchase a custom-made suit. The opportunities are endless! What boutique hotel would you recommend to your friends that are stopping through? I would definitely recommend The Orchid . A self-described “hostel for grown-ups”, The Orchid regularly holds free wine tastings for gests to get to know one another. Located in one of Beijing’s hutong neighborhoods, there are only ten guest rooms, all furnished in Qing dynasty style surrounding a quaint courtyard. Rooms start at 680 yuan per night (just over $100 USD). Click here for rates and availability.  What about 5 Star, of them all, which is the best in your town? If you’re looking for luxury, be sure to check out the Shangrila’s World Summit Wing Hotel . Located on the top floors of the tallest building in Beijing, this luxurious hotel hosts Bill Gates on his trips to China. There is even an infinity pool on the 78 th floor, as well as a rooftop bar on floor 80. With spacious rooms, giant bathtubs and feather-down pillows, Shangrila is the definition of 5 Star. Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? Looking for an adventure? Hike the Jinlingshan section of the Great Wall. With almost no other tourists, a steep hike will lead to breathtaking views. Just be sure to bring good hiking shoes! Are you an adventurous eater? Wander through Beijing’s Wanfujing night market where you can find fried scorpions, sheep testicles and snake kabobs among other things. Where are the best hang outs during the day? If you’re an early riser, be sure to head down to Beijing’s Temple of Heaven. In addition to the beautiful architecture, you’ll find locals practicing Tai chi, singing songs and toting around small toddler grandchildren. This park is by far the best place for people watching in all of Beijing. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Beijing and what are their best dishes? While in Beijing, be sure to head to Hai Di Lao, a famous hotpot chain. A large pot of boiling broth is placed in the center of the table, surrounded by raw vegetables, meat, noodles and more. Patrons can place items in the simmering broth and remove them when they’re cooked. Hai Di Lao offers both spicy and non-spicy versions, so everyone can enjoy. Be aware that on a weekend night you may have to wait over an hour for a table. While the wait can be long, Hai Di Lao offers complimentary snacks, tea and even shoeshines and manicures! Best of all? Taking your significant other to Hai Di Lao won’t break the bank. I usually spend about $15 per person and leave completely stuffed. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? While in Beijing, be sure to explore the small Korean-style bakeries that dot the city. Relax with a coffee and a small cake or pastry in the afternoon. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Beijing is the place to go for fake designer goods and custom-made clothing. The city is covered in bargaining markets, which tend to look more like bargaining malls . Here you can buy souvenir trinkets, jade jewelry, silk, fake designer bags, and much more. Looking for a new suit or a custom made coat or dress? The tailors here are skilled and much less expensive than those in America or Europe. My favorite bargaining market is the one at the Jianguomen metro stop. They have an amazing selection and are less aggressive than the Sanlitun market, which is more common with tourists. Just be sure to bargain hard . Don’t worry if you don’t speak Chinese , all of the shops will bargain with a calculator! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Beijing? The best place for pampering in Beijing is Green T House. Part spa, part upscale restaurant, Green T House is chic and modern with unique spa packages. The signature Bamboo special combines four hours of spa treatments, including a green tea bath, meditation, steam scrub, a facial and their signature ten-handed massage. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? One of the best and most unique sunset views in Beijing is in Jingshan Park. Jingshan Park contains a large hill that overlooks the Forbidden City. Hike up a bit before sunset to get a snapshot of the sprawling Forbidden City, then watch the sun set behind old imperial Beijing. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. When the sun goes down, head out to Sanlitun and enjoy a nice cocktail. If you love beer, be sure to check out Beer Mania, which serves a vast array of specialty beers with a generous happy hour. Afterwards, feel free to grab a local Tsingtao beer from one of the many convenience stores and wander down the narrow streets filled with tasty street food. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Sanlitun is also home to the best clubs in Beijing. If you want to experience a crazy Chinese nightclub complete with dance performances and bottle service, check out MIX. Sanlitun is packed with bars and clubs, so feel free to wander around and explore. My personal favorite club in Beijing is Sensation, located in Wudaokou. A bit out of the way, Sensation is a more American or European style club, with a large dance floor and an active bar. They also offer three free cocktails to ladies on Thursday! Be sure to grab some Mexican food at La Bamba next door before you head home for the night."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2013/11/best-free-attractions-macau-budget/,china,"10 FREE Things to Do in MACAU The cost of living in other major cities may be much lower, but Macau is definitely one of the most budget-friendly urban destinations in this part of Asia.

We couldn’t wait to get to Dubrovnik, hoping to stay at a sobe in Old Town. Here’s the prequel: Megan and I had been traveling for over 2 days from Corfu, an island in Greece through Albania and Montenegro before we finally reached Croatia. It was all a nice little accident; we originally thought we could take a ferry from Corfu straight to Croatia. We were silly. The journey- ferry, bus, mini-bus, hitchhike, taxi, bus- was exhausting but exhilarating because we felt like explorers, only, we didn’t know the language, currency, or where we were located on a map. At one point I wasn’t sure which country we were in. I was pretty into Carmen Sandiego when I was little, but obviously never won that computer game. At this time, Albania, Montenegro, and Croatia were not part of the EU (Croatia now is). That means we should get our passports checked at border control. Ha, so that wasn’t quite how it went down, maybe because while racially profiling, they decided we were awesomely sweet and innocent, therefore welcoming us into the country with open arms regardless of our nationality. This post is really hard to write because Dubrovnik, the Pearl of the Adriatic , was one of my favorite cities in Eastern Europe, but there was so much more in Croatia I want to experience! Like usual, I hadn’t done enough research. We knew there were some other options like Split, Zagreb, Ljubljana, the many islands, and the Plitvice Lakes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But with little time allowance, we chose Dubrovnik, along the beautiful Adriatic coast, and stayed for 4 days. The “staying” is where it gets really exciting. Where do you stay in Croatia: a guesthouse? Hostel? Hotel? Nope. Just women from the bus stop. They’re selling rooms in their homes to make a living, like the new airBnB . The rooms are called sobes, but the women offering up these rooms aren’t all as cute as you’d think. They can be quite aggressive, swarming the bus and ferry arrivals, each one hoping you pick them, and angry when you don’t. “you want room? Sobe? Good price! Near old town! Map map! Good price!” they all tell you in unison. Although, not unlike any other tout at a bus stop, it’s strange coming from these little old ladies. We initially checked out a campsite- 20 E with no tent provided… no thanks. So we went back to the bus stop and chose our sobe after some horrible negotiating. We settled on 500 kuna, about 16 bucks, split between the two of us. That was her original offer. She was a tough old broad. We got lucky with an awesome private room at a good location overlooking old town. She drove up to the house from a back road, and showed us from the front how we could simply walk down approximately 500 stairs and be in the city. I only fell face first down them once (maxi dresses had just become popular, my legs were confused).   yep, fell down these. view from our room  Another “easier” ways to stay with at a sobe is to go to any tourism office in town to have it arranged. The benefit for you is an easy booking with photos to guarantee what type of place you’re staying in. The downside is, you usually pay a little more in booking fees, plus the middleman will take even more off the top, meaning the sobe gets less money. Obviously, an alternative option is to not stay at a sobe at all. There are hostels, campsites, and hotels, but sobes are an interesting and fun part of Croatian culture. These women are hardened from years of war, and actually being around them is a little intimidating. You can see in their faces and bodies they have worked hard their whole lives and seen such intense things- how silly they must think us backpackers are! Although seeming unapproachable, they are welcoming… maybe only because that’s their business. Our lady made us tea and juice, and even offered us dinner that we refused, so that we could go out into town. Are the Sobes safe? It’s really unregulated. In Eastern Europe, even places we stayed in from Hostelworld were simply someone’s home. Could you get everything stolen and leave with bedbugs crawling all over your luggage? Maybe, but come one that’s probably not going to happen. You can book through the Croatian site that sobes should register with.  but it will probably cost you more than just showing up. photo credit: flickr What To Do in ‘Old Town’ of Dubrovnik Eat a Mea Culpa. Delicious, enormous pizzas for about 5 euros. I got the four cheese with corn, scrumptious! Then get some gelato. Check out the Castle’s Ancient City Walls. You can pay to walk the castle walls, which I didn’t do, but I’m sure would offer even more amazing views of the Adriatic Sea. The “Walls of Dubrovnik” have protected Croatia since the 7 th century, and were never breached during the Middle Ages, making them the best! They became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Even as late at 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, This wall prevented Yugoslavia from completely demolishing the Old Town. Free Walking Tour, which I didn’t do. But I LOVE a free walking tour so it’s a shame I missed this one, seeing as though the history in Croatia is not so far in the past. Wander around Old Town.  All cities with a castle are magical. I’m going to go ahead and make that bold statement. Dubrovnik is no exception. The city is magnificent; the stone streets, amazing views, and couples there on destination weddings. The shopping is a little pricey, but the food is on the cheap! The streets are full of entertainers… and stray cats. Use Dubrovnik as a hub to an island. Popular destinations are Mljet (a national park) and Korcula. Take a cable car ride to see views from above the city. The restaurant is pricey but worth the views!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/04/hbo-game-thrones-filming-locations-tourist-spots/,croatia,"15 Game of Thrones Filming Locations that You Can Visit It’s that time of the year again! You know that another Game of Thrones season has begun when your Facebook news feed is flooded with cheers of excitement, cries of anger, and death threats for friends who are posting spoilers. It is not difficult to understand why HBO’s highly entertaining and often wildly brutal adaptation of the George RR Martin novels has reached the legendary status in pop culture. It has all the right ingredients: compelling characters, convincing production, unpredictable plot twists, and the right amount of fantasy. And dragons! Put it all together and you get a weekly serving of wonder. Brutal at times, but still pretty mindblowing. But there’s one more thing that always captivates me about this phenomenal hit. On the Season 6 premiere, for instance, when the khalasar made their way to Khal Jhaqo with Daenerys Targaryen in tow, I was so drawn to the arid landscape that surrounded them that I googled it right away. Bardenas Reales in Spain, it turned out. I have been so fascinated with GoT’s choices of filming locations that I have come up with a mission: visit as many of them as I can. The first that I set foot on was Essaouira in Morocco, which was where all Astapor scenes were shot (including that part where Khaleesi freed the Unsullied and ordered them to kill their masters). And when I backpack across Europe later this year, I’m certainly making stops in Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Spain.       So I decided to make a list of the fictional places in the series and their real-life counterparts, where they were primarily filmed. But before we begin, some notes: This list covers exterior shots only. Many of the interior sequences were actually done elsewhere. For example, Dobrovnik’s streets and coastal walls are used mainly for King’s Landing, but interior shots (Red Keep, Iron Throne, etc.) are done in sets in Northern Ireland. This is not 1:1. King’s Landing may be filmed mainly in Dubrovnik, but they also took supplementary footage of Essaouira and Malta as the Westeros capital. Dubrovnik also stood in for the City of Qarth in Season 2. Many of these sites have been digitally modified or enhanced by the show. Winterfell, for example, is almost unrecognizable as Castle Ward. This is not complete. I will update this as the series moves forward. Now that we got the caveats out of the way, here it is: a Game of Thrones fan’s travel bucket list! WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1.

King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia The ancient port city of Dubrovnik has seen a steady increase in tourism since they first used it to depict King’s Landing in Season 1. Executive Producer David Benioff said, “The first time we saw Dubrovnik, I was in shock, because the whole city really looked the way we pictured King’s Landing looking.” 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland Castle Ward tower digitally modified to create Winterfell The vast 1000-acre grounds surrounding Castle Ward has hosted the production team as they bring to life many of the series’ key moments, including scenes featuring Winterfell, seat of the House Stark and capital of the North. Much of the first 2 seasons took advantage of the sheer size of its grassy farmyard, perfect for army camp sequences, and ancient structures including Audley’s Castle. 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland The Magheramorne Quarry is an abandoned limestone quarry in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is where the Castle Black set was installed. (It has also been used as Hardhome and the city walls of King’s Landing in Season 2’s Blackwater episode.) It is currently not accessible to the public, but there are pending plans of reopening it as a mountain biking center. Fingers crossed. 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland Iceland as Wildling and White Walker territory Iceland in real life Most of the events north of the Wall of Westeros are realized in Iceland. This includes the glacier at Snæfellsjökull (I don’t even know how to pronounce that properly) which was used as the Fist of the First Men; Mývatn Lake, a frozen lava lake close to the town of Akureyri, which was where Mance Rayder’s wildling group dwelled; and Grjótagjá Cave, where Jon Snow and Ygritte had a very wet consummation of their love. 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain Alcázar of Seville as Sunspear in Dorne Alcázar of Seville in reality Dorne was actually what I was so excited to see on television. I just thought it had the most character. Dorne, the southernmost region of the Seven Kingdoms, in the books was actually inspired by medieval Spain, so it totally makes sense that they chose Seville as location, including Sunspear, seat of House Martell, which was actually the Alcázar of Seville in reality. This season, fans are also excited to see the Tower of Joy, which was said to be Castillo de Zafra, a 12th-century castle in Guadalajara. 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland Also known as “raised beach,” Ballintoy Harbor in County Antrim can take pride in being real-life Iron Islands. Images of this picturesque harbor were digitally enhanced to mimic the jaw-dropping seascape of Pyke and Lordsport. You remember that scene where Theon Greyjoy first meets his sister Yara? That was shot here. 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland Stannis Baratheon’s bailiwick is actually Downhill Strand, a beach destination in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It’s where Stannis and Melisandre set the Seven idols on fire and where Davos allowed Gendry to flee. 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland Kingsroad Do you remember when Arya, Yoren, Gendry, and Hot Pie were on the way to the Wall after escaping King’s Landing? Did you notice the beautiful avenue flanked with rows of eerie but beautiful trees? That’s the Dark Hedges of Armoy, which in the GoT world is Kingsroad. It is actually a road of beech trees, which according to Northern Ireland’s tourism website , were planted in the 18th century by the Stuart family “to impress visitors as they approached the entrance to their Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.” 9. Pentos: Malta See that arch in the background? That’s the Azure Window, a famous feature of the Maltese Island of Gozo. Azure Window IRL. And now we go all the way back to Season 1. The Mediterranean archipelago of Malta has been home to the GoT team for many days, too, mostly during the filming of Pentos. In particular, the 16th century Verdala Palace, the official summer residence of the Maltese President, stood in for the mansion of Illyrio Mopatis, the merchant-prince who sold Daenerys to Khal Drogo in marriage. The wedding feast then took place in Gozo Island, the second largest island in Malta. 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia Meereen, the largest city that Daenerys Targaryen has conquered and ruled so far, is the Croatian city of Split in real life. Situated on the coast of Dalmatia, this picturesque city faces the Adriatic Sea. Among the sites used in the series is the Diocletian’s Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site, whose cellars provided replacement for the underground passages in Meereen. 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia Šibenik, a quiet medieval town in Central Dalmatia, Croatia, made its GoT debut in Season 5 as the free city of Braavos, where Arya Stark found herself after sailing from Westeros and where the Iron Bank is located. 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco Essaouira as Astapor Essaouira in real life The port city of Essaouira along the Atlantic coast of Morocco serves as Astapor, one of the cities in Slaver’s Bay. Essaouira is where most scenes in Astapor was shot, including the unforgettable and iconic scene wherein Daenerys Targaryen bought and freed the Unsullied, and then ordered her dragons to attack. Dracarys! 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco Aït-Ben-Haddou as Yunkai Aït-Ben-Haddou IRL. Also in Morocco is the old city of Aït-Ben-Haddou, a fortified city on the edge of the great Sahara desert. It’s no stranger to movies as it has been the setting for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), and Prince of Persia (2010) among others. But in the GoT world, Aït-Ben-Haddou is Yunkai, aka Yellow City and one of the three great city-states in Slaver’s Bay. 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain Vaes Dothrak has yet to be featured, but rumor has it that the team tapped the exotic charms of Almeria, a city in Andalusia, Spain, for this. We’ll see in the coming episodes. 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Many places have been used to depict the many parts of Dothraki Sea, but in the Season 6 premiere, the place we casually refer to as “wherever the fuck Drogon dropped Daenerys” is Bardenas Reales, the 100,000-acre badlands in southeast Navarre, Spain. "https://hippie-inheels.com/one-month-itinerary-for-cuba/,cuba,"Havana More than likely you’ll be flying into the Cuban capital to start your trip, and there’s no better place to step through the Cuban time portal. Suggested time: 4 days What to do: Stroll the Malecón The city sea wall which stretches on for 8 km is an emblematic symbol of Havana and Cuban street life. At any given hour of the day, you can find potentially hundreds of Cubans &amp; tourists playing music, drinking rum, fishing, or simply just enjoying life. Get lost in Habana Vieja This is the most beautiful section of Havana, and likewise the most touristy. By all means explore the many museums, churches, and bars that are highly concentrated here, but for me, the best thing to do is simply wander the streets and lose yourself in the aging decadence that only Habana Vieja can offer. Take a break from the sun at La Bodeguita del Medio , the birthplace of the mojito &amp; the late Earnest Hemingway’s favorite jaunt. Explore the Forts By the late 16th century, Havana had become the largest port in the region, so naturally the Spanish armada wanted to protect their gem of the New World. So what did they do? They didn’t just construct one fort, but four MASSIVE forts (and a few smaller ones) to defend the port from invasion. They are well-preserved and have fantastic museums inside. Plaza de la Revolución A tribute to Los Heroes de la Revolución (Heroes of the Revolution) like Che Guevara, Camilo Cienfuegos, &amp; Jose Martí, this plaza was stage to some of Fidel Castro’s memorable speeches that galvanized the country against imperial powers. Viñales Everyone knows Cuban cigars are the best in the world. Viñales is where Cuba produces the finest of its cash crop. But it’s not just any old honey-pot, La Valle de Viñales (Viñales Valley) is surrounded by sugar-loaf shaped limestone mountains, forming a spectacular backdrop for any tour through the valley. Suggested time: 2 days What to do: Take a horse-back riding tour of the tobacco farms Touring the tobacco farms that dot the valley floor can be done on foot as well, but I recommend the horse-back riding tours because the distance is substantial, it’s usually hot as hell, and you can’t beat the price ($4CUC/hour!). It’s very interesting hearing the farmers explain the entire harvesting &amp; packing process, so if you don’t speak Spanish you may want to hire a bilingual guide. Bay of Pigs (Bahía de Cochinos) Widely considered as being the best scuba diving on mainland Cuba, taking a short detour to explore the underwater paradises of Playa Girón and Playa Larga is much easier &amp; cheaper than chartering a flight or boat to Isla de Juventud or Jardines de la Reina. A few meters off shore, a coral wall plunges into an ominous, deep blue abyss – it was some of the best diving I’ve ever done! There are also various cenotes &amp; caves to dive in the area. Suggested time: 1-2 days Cienfuegos The city of Cienfuegos is ok, it has some cool French architecture and serves as a good example of the real, working class Cuba. But it’s the sites around Cienfuegos that make it a nice stop on your Cuba itinerary. Suggested time: 2 days What to do: Go snorkeling at Rancho Luna It’ll cost you $6 &amp; 20 minutes from the city center to have the sand between your toes. The snorkeling &amp; scuba diving is quality out here too. Cool off at El Nicho If you want some waterfall time during your trip to Cuba, El Nicho is the one. Crystal-clear blue swimming pools &amp; multiple cascades wash the backpacker scent off in beautiful fashion. Taxis (about $40 roundtrip) can be procured from Cienfuegos, so find others to share the costs with! Trinidad Trinidad is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Cuba, and for good reason. It’s colonial architecture, cobble-stone streets, colorful atmosphere, &amp; close proximity to the beach are sure to keep the tourists coming for years to come. Suggested time: 3-5 days What to do: Bike Ride to Playa Ancón An idyllic beach, located about 12km away makes for a nice hour-long bicycle pedal, or $8 taxi ride. Sweat out those mojitos at Casa de la Música My favorite Casa de la Música in Cuba (they’re in every city), Trinidad’s version has a big beautiful staircase out front with steps so wide they double as dance floors. You can boogie every night of the week if you want. Don’t like your dance partner? Hop down to the next step &amp; find someone else! Cliff jump and swim through a cave at Javira waterfall A unique, waterfall/cave combo with a refreshing green pool to take a dip in or cliff jump. For more in-depth information about Trinidad, see another article of mine about the 5 Best Things to Do in Trinidad, Cuba. Santa Clara For history buffs, &amp; or those looking for a quick crash course in Cuban Revolution history, go to Santa Clara. This is the city that Che Guevara liberated, turning the tide in the Revolution &amp; changing the fate of the nation. Suggested time: 2 days What to do: Pay your respects at the Che mausoleum &amp; memorials The remains of the world’s most famous guerrilla can be visited directly beneath his statue, and beside a very interesting &amp; informative museum with exclusive photos. There are also other important, historical sites around town that those interested in better understanding the Cuban Revolution should visit. Get funky with the university scene nightlife With a history so rich, and a thriving university nowadays, it’s no wonder that Santa Clara remains radically revolutionary. Political protests by day turn into funky fiestas at night, which begs the question – when do these kids sleep? Camagüey Located smack-dab in the middle of the island, Camagüey is a worthy stop to break up your cross-country haul. Nicknamed “La Ciudad Confusa,” Camagüey’s streets were purposely designed like a maze to confuse pirates and other potential invaders. Spend a day here meandering through the many parks and plazas, and taking in the interesting architecture before jumping back on the bus the next day. Suggested time: 1 day Guardalavaca Cuba has countless beautiful beaches, but many of the best ones are strictly regulated by the government, only accessible to people staying in expensive, beach resorts, &amp; therefore lacking in true Cuban authenticity (I’m looking at you Varadero). Guardalavaca is unique because despite being one of most beautiful beaches in all of Cuba, and despite having massive tourist resorts constructed on it, it remains open to the public. Cuban families &amp; extranjeros (foreigners) are free to interact, adding a humble &amp; authentic aire to the paradisiacal atmosphere. They are nearby casa particulares to stay at as well for the budget-minded. Suggested time: 3 days What to do: Chilllllll  Santiago de Cuba Santiago de Cuba is hot, loud, and assaults all of your senses simultaneously, but you’ll love it. The birthplace of the revolution, this city is surrounded by lush, green mountains, and filled with culture, music &amp; street life. Suggested time: 4 days What to do: Wander through El Morro Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca (as it’s officially known) is a UNESCO World Heritage site. This castle was constructed at the mouth of the Bay of Santiago de Cuba to defend the city from naval invasions. It gives you great perspective of the entire bay, and lots of interesting exhibits in the museum. Cuartel Moncada Where it all started. The young Señor Fidel Castro &amp; his motley crew assaulted these military barracks in 1956 in an attempt to overthrow the US-backed dictatorship. They failed, and Castro fled the country after being released from prison, only to return years later in spectacular fashion to spearhead La Revolución, take his country back, &amp; change the world forever. Now the barracks are home to a grade school &amp; one of the best museums in all the country. Climb La Piedra Grande Translated literally as “The Big Rock,” it is…well, a pretty big-ass rock. This 70,000 ton boulder looks as if it was placed by the hand of God himself on top of a 4,000 foot mountain. Not only are the views of the city &amp; ocean great, but the nearby Isabelica coffee farms are a UNESCO World Heritage site. Dance, dance, dance Everywhere you go in Cuba you’ll have opportunities to dance like you’ve never danced before, but Santiago takes it to another level. There’s no need to pay for salsa classes here, just take a stroll down Calle Heredia when the sun sets and you’ll find lines of Cubanos ready to take you for a twirl ( disclaimer: don’t worry, they’ll be older than the group of folklore girl dancers above ). Baracoa Secluded from the rest of Cuba in a hard-to-get-to corner. 29 rivers. Tropical, mysterious rainforest. Steamy, odd-shaped mountains. Hidden beaches. Local cacao &amp; coconut-infused seafood cuisine. Welcome to Baracoa. Suggested time: 4 days What to do: Climb El Yunque It’s only 575m (1886 ft) high, but climbing this table-shaped mountain was a right of passage for the indigenous Taino people, and should be for any tourist as well. Go early in the morning if you don’t want to sweat half of your body weight out. Take a boat ride up Boca de Yumurí The Yumurí is a lazy, green river that winds through a deep canyon and flows out into the ocean. Locals wait at the mouth of the river to row you upstream. Get your camera ready, the towering canyon walls are home to many exotic birds. Cross Río Miel &amp; explore the Fuentes farm caves At the far end of the beach past the baseball stadium, you’ll find a bridge that crosses the river to a more primitive corner of Baracoa. Here the Fuentes family runs tours on their farm in defiance of the government, and there is an extensive cave system to explore, including Cueva de las Aguas where you can take a fresh water dip in the pitch black dark. And don’t forget the last part of your itinerary! An 18-hour Viazul bus alllll the way back to Havana. Cuba is Not Just Another Country to Check off the Bucket List I hope this itinerary has given you an idea of where to go &amp; what to see during your time in Cuba, but the allure in this country doesn’t just lie in the beautiful beaches, cheap mojitos, awesome music, and time-machine appearance. Traveling to Cuba has the ability to change how you think, put certain things back into perspective, and certainly shatter stereotypes. For me, it was refreshing to spend time in a society where technology &amp; internet haven’t really penetrated yet, and it was a reminder of how rich real-life, human interaction can truly be. Furthermore, the resiliently optimistic attitudes of Cubans, in spite of having virtually no disposable income and limited human rights, is nothing short of inspiring. I left Cuba with not just another country checked off the bucket list, but as a changed person with a greater appreciation for the simple things in life. I dare you to go spend a month in Cuba and tell me you don’t feel the same."https://hippie-inheels.com/prague/,czech_republic,"Prague: My favorite city and not just because of Bohemian Bagel The International Folklore Festival was taking place while we were in Prague, how lucky is that? It reminded me a lot of Krakow’s festival . Couples, men’s groups, and little kids perform dances and play instruments in traditional clothing. There were of course food stalls and vendors selling chocolates, trinkets, breads, and sausages. This was the perfect place for me to buy souvenirs. That’s one thing as a backpacker that many people say you have to stop doing- but I can’t. When I’m on a plane home after a big trip abroad, all I think about is giving all the gifts away I purchased. My parents always have to open theirs before we even pull out of the airport parking lot. One thing to buy in Prague : those little dolls that are inside of each other, ­­­“nesting dolls”. Highlights of Prague Free walking tour .   Unlike the boring one in Krakow, this walking tour showed me all I needed to know about Prague, plus some! They work with a pub-crawl, which I’m usually not up for because they’re often lame, but our couchsurfing host’s friend was a tour leader. She gave us a discount we couldn’t pass up. views from above! check out the preztels on each table. Yum! After our walking tour, we went on the pub-crawl and it was actually a lot of fun. 10 bucks got us all the vodka, beer, and absinthe we could down, plus free cover at the biggest club in Prague, which has 5 stories, each playing a different type of music.  (PS: working a pub-crawl or free walking tour is a great way to stay on the road. You make commission and you don’t have to be local, you just have to speak English.) On the walking tour, we saw the National Museum in the town square, which looked just like the one in Berlin ! The original town hall is only half a building now. Some overrated tourist sights like interesting statues and the astronomical clock that everyone hovers around until it strikes the hour, the 12 apostles march around, and Christ comes out of a trap door. We went into an old church with a gross old arm hanging from the ceiling; it’s the hand of a thief from the 1400’s. The Jewish quarter was gorgeous, and the Charles Bridge offered stunning views of the castle and city. There is a massive metronome on top of the hill where Stalin’s statue used to be. A memorial called Anna Chromy Il Commendatore, for the premiere of Mozart’s Don Giovanni in 1787. church with the severed arm The story behind the Revolution Keys is one you won’t forget: The Velvet Revolution in 1989 which brought down the end of the communist rule. There had been many student protests around this time, but during this movement, crowds on the street in unison jingled their keys in the air meaning goodbye to the leaders, and that they were unlocking new doors. Bohemian Bagel is what happens when two American guys decide to open a bagel shop in Prague. They are only in Czech Republic and remind me so much at home that I ate there two times, and would have eaten there more! Their turkey bagel had a third bagel layer in the middle- it was huge. Check out this travel guide to foodie Prague to see all the best local places to eat. The proximity to Cesky Krumlov means that you MUST take the time to go there! Just three hours by bus, you can explore a bohemian fairy tale land of castles and bears . The bus is only four euro, it served hot chocolate, and played Malibu’s Most Wanted; I mean how could it get better? love the colors of the buildings, strangely like the beach houses in South Carolina Make sure you leave an afternoon to not be a tourist. Stop sightseeing and hang out at a  beer garden or do some shopping!  Although Prague is such a big city with many tourists coming through, I still felt welcomed and had a great time out at local bars and restaurants. 200 shops, could I be happier? How cute is this? Huck would never. he’d run in and destroy the store. Like, just now I made cookies- he jumped on the counter somehow and ate them. no joke! Worst of Prague: food poising that kicked it just before my flight to AMERICA. That’s right a transatlantic flight with food poisoning. Europe’s way of punishing me for leaving I guess. Beware of supermarket pre-made sandwiches. They have expiration dates… and you should read them."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,czech_republic,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,denmark,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom.

We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it.

A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum.

There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,england,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-london/,england,"What makes London a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? London’s full of the old, historic grandeur of the past as well as innovative ideas to spice up any luxury experience. The more I see of other cities, the more I appreciate how flexible London can be: it’s the posh, traditional mother or father and it’s the gritty cool kid – but always (well, most of the time) done with a touch of sophistication. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? There are a few! The complete classic is The Savoy . If you come here, you’ve hit the big time. The St Pancras Renaissance Hotel is probably the most beautiful looking hotel from the outside (and inside!) I’ve ever seen in London. What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? There are probably three options: two of them are Firmdale hotels, the Covent Garden Hotel and Soho Hotel . They’re boutique on the most luxury end of the scale. For more quirk, I’d go with The Hoxton Hotel in Shoreditch. It’s not as much typical boutique as part of the new breed of hip hotels with that streetwise but homely feel, with an open fireplace, exposed brick wall and books. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? You can climb up the Millenium Dome (now called the o2) which is near where I live, in Greenwich! Do it at sunset – you’ll get a wonderful view over London. There’s also a speedboat that’ll swing you around on the Thames with some funny music, like the James Bond theme tune. Experiencing London’s landmarks from the river gives you a bit of a different perspective. In summer, there’s a really fun trend to learn to trapeze outside in some of London’s parks. For a built up city, it’s got a lot of options. Where are the best hang outs during the day?   London’s parks are lovely – I’ve had many lazy, sunny afternoons in Hyde Park, Regent’s Park and St James’ Park (which looks magical in the spring with flowers everywhere and a view of the London Eye). There are even lidos you can spend the day at – I went to Brockwell Lido last summer, and even though it can’t properly take the place of a good beach, I’ll accept it as a substitute!   London has so many markets dotted around to explore with friends or by yourself. One of my favourites is Columbia Road Flower Market – for flowers, believe it or not. It also has cafés and cute independent shops so you have somewhere to go after the hustle and bustle of all kinds of beautiful flowers being excitedly sold. I always try to pick up a bunch of sunflowers here as they’re a favourite flower of mine. I recently went to Maltby Street Market with my sister, which left us so pleasantly surprised. Located under railway arches, it has such an authentic feel and every food stall you look at has you intrigued. In the winter, it’s all about cafés and pubs. London loves pubs. Wilton Music Hall is perfect for some history and a pint. The worn away and exposed walls with its relaxed vibe make you feel so comfortable to settle down and cosily while away the day. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in London and what are their best dishes? I have an American boyfriend who lives in Boston, so whenever he visits London, I always try to impress him with the city’s restaurants. To be honest, it’s a challenge to pick somewhere as London has so many restaurants. We’ve gone to Sushisamba, which has some other locations over the world, but in London it’s got a great view and their sashimi is awesome. Head outside for a cocktail by the fire, too – the mojito is a treat. Location: Heron Tower, 110 Bishopsgate, London EC2N 4AY In London, we get a ton of concept restaurants – the most recent I’ve been to is called Bubbledogs: all sorts of hotdogs (you can choose toppings from mac’n’cheese to caramelised lettuce), and an extensive list of champagne. It’s a genius idea to me that still manages to leave you feeling glamorous, despite eating hot dogs. Location: 70 Charlotte St, London W1T 4QG Village East is also great: modern European food presented so well and some killer cocktails. Location: 171-173 Bermondsey St, London SE1 3UW Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? I’m weirdly going to have to mention a brunch spot here. It’s the Cookbook Café, inside the Intercontinental Hotel. You get unlimited bellinis and an all you can eat buffet – but in a classy way – including waffles topped with popping candy, eggs benedict, sashimi, and finally, masses of dessert cakes, including little macaroons. It’s incredible and is honestly one of my favourite places to go in London.   Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? Avoid Oxford Street like the plague! Ok, maybe an exaggeration – it does have everything you need, but only go there very early. It’s so busy and it can get pretty stressful at times (Christmas shopping here this year will definitely be a pain I must suffer!). I prefer Long Acre in Covent Garden area as it still has some of my favourite shops (like Zara, but sadly not Topshop) and is much less busy. It’s definitely worth checking out the markets, too. Spitalfields market is great for upcoming designers and it’s a great day out. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in London?   Sadly my favourite spa right in the middle of London recently closed down, so I’m trying to find another! I’ve heard good things about the Mandarin Oriental Hotel’s spa in Hyde Park. The Berkeley Spa has a rooftop pool with views over Hyde Park and is a hit with celebrities, or Four Seasons Spa, which is located on the tenth floor… also over Hyde Park. Basically, head to Hyde Park for all your glamorous, luxury needs.   Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? I think the key with a memorable London sunset is to go high. My favourite has been while having afternoon tea in Tower 42. I treated my mum for her birthday and we sipped champagne while watching the sun set right behind the view of London, with St Paul’s Cathedral in one direction and Tower Bridge another. Otherwise, I’m always a big fan of a sunset from a park. Primrose Hill gives you a good view, and Hyde Park is gorgeous. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. This is where things get tricky – I’m not sure I can adequately express my love for cocktails, so I’m always hunting around for a new watering hole. There’s Calooh Callay, which is a bar in East London with a collection of weird and wonderful decorations. For chocolate lovers, Dirty Martini in Covent Garden has a delicious chocolate martini (chocolate swirl included). And for a really intimate setting, Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth is like a trendy grandma’s living room, with drinks served in teacups and mason jars. Secret bars are a big thing here too. Head to Evans &amp; Peel Detective Agency (it really is a bar, I promise) where you need to come with a ‘case’ that proves you worthy of seeing the Detective i.e. entering the bar. If that’s not earning your drink, I’m not sure what is… I have to mention Circus, too. It’s a bar and restaurant in Covent Garden where circus acts perform their tricks and talents (such as flamethrowing and much more) on the central table throughout the evening. On the weekends it stays open as a club where you can then dance on the tables. You can also get drinks at the Shard which can be pricey, but a very ‘London’ experience. It also gives you pretty much the same view as at the top but without having to buy the ticket! Definitely put on your best dress/suit here, it’s the perfect excuse to dress up."ttps://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-york/,england,"What makes York a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? York is a stunning medieval UK city that attracts travelers and tourists from all over the world. The  city of York boasts one of the highest numbers of independent shops within a city centre in the UK.  York was the Roman capital of England, and one of the great things about the city is that it is very  compact and walkable. It is popular for weekend breaks and particularly Christmas shopping  breaks in December. York is also known for the glamour and fashion of York Races. What 5 star hotel is the best in York? The Royal York Hotel is my Top 5* hotel in York, although the gym and spa are currently going  under some renovation.

I  would definitely recommend the Hotel Du Vin to friends and family. Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in York? Falconry is a popular activity in Yorkshire. You can visit The Bird of Prey Centre which is just 12  miles North of York up the A19. You will probably need a taxi or a car for this trip.  You simply must take a river cruise with ‘York Boat’. There are also evening cruises and lunch time cruises that provide afternoon tea. Head down to the river at Lendall Bridge, or book online with  www.yorkboat.co.uk . Where are the best hang outs during the day in York? Museum Gardens is a beautiful place to relax. They also do free Owl Flying shows on summer  afternoons!  My favourite cafe in York is The Hungry Artist, an art studio and cafe rolled into one. The Hungry  Artist does a beautiful peach tea and offers a menu with many gluten free options. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in York and what are their  best dishes? I highly recommend the Blue Bicycle on Fossgate and the Walgate Ale House (you must go there for  a Sunday Roast). If you enjoy Tapas, visit La Ambiente on Goodramgate. All of these restaurants  are walkable from the city centre, because York is a very small and compact medieval city. Let’s talk desserts in York- what place makes the best? It’s got to be Betty’s – York is famous for this English tea shop with a selection of beautiful desserts  including macaroons. There are some amazing cakes on offer in the Earl Grey Tea Rooms on the  Shambles – I always go for the Carrot Cake. Also, if you are a chocoholic like me, be sure to head to  the York Chocolate Story cafe! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in York; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?   Explore the independent retailers in the city centre, particularly on the famous street – The  Shambles. Fossgate also has some quirky shops including ‘Give the Dog a Bone’ – home to many  pop culture gifts and images. For crafty markets, these occur on and around Parliament Street at  different times of the year.  If you are looking for designer gear, head to the York Designer Outlet (a 15 minute drive from York  City Centre, near the interchange of the A64 and A19). What are a couple of the best salons and spas in York? Middlethorpe Spa on Bishopthorpe Road is the best in the city centre. They do a wonderful  champagne afternoon tea and spa.  If you have a car and are willing to travel outside of York, Aldwark Manor Golf and Spa Hotel is  highly recommended. credit cathedral:  r..m Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us in on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a  great pre-gaming spot.

Evil Eye Lounge does  amazing cocktails and has a brilliant atmosphere – their screaming orgasm is amazing! If you want  a Medieval experience, visit the House of Trembling Madness also on Stonegate. credit pub &amp; view:  Evgenii If you end the night at a fancy club in York, which one do you head towards? You can go to Fibbers or the Duchess for dancing until the early hours (they do some good Indie  and Rock nights).

Trains run run after midnight, just check in advance  for your return time."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-chelsea-london/,england,"What makes Chelsea a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Chelsea is one of the most exclusive and up-scale areas of London; the residence of choice for many affluent people and a hang out for the rich and famous, even royalty. With that being the case there are plenty of fabulous restaurants and bars and the shopping is some of the best in London. What 5 star hotel is the best in Chelsea? The super deluxe London hotels are generally to found in Mayfair but Chelsea is home to some gorgeous boutique hotels. The Belgraves , A Thompson Hotel ( review here ) is one of my favorites. It’s chic and modern with a gorgeous upscale restaurant serving fresh and seasonal cuisine. The hotel is also perfectly situated for shopping in Knightsbridge or Sloane street. Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in Chelsea, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? For a hotel with history, check out 11 Cadogan Gardens , ( review here ) a gorgeous boutique hotel originally built as four Victorian Townhouses. The interior design of the hotel is traditional, with dark wood and Gothic features such as a dramatic sweeping stair case and large gilt mirrors and hanging lights. Located in one of the mews streets leading off Sloane Square, it’s a little hidden gem away from the hustle and bustle of Central London. The afternoon tea is very reasonably priced and it’s a great way to refresh after a day of shopping. Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun activities that allow you to see another side of Chelsea? A walking tour is a great way to get to know London. Chelsea is known for being the home of many great authors and if you explore the side streets you can see where Bram Stoker lived, where Mark Twain stayed and the home of Oscar Wilde. For something a little less high brow you can explore the favorite haunts of the cast of Made in Chelsea, a popular reality TV series. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Chelsea? There are some great places to go for brunch, check out the Bluebird Café with its beautiful outdoor space or Tom’s Kitchen for Modern British comfort food. There are also some great stylish pubs that are always bustling with people, two of my favorites are the Botantist and the Phene. Or you’re craving some green space, check out the Chelsea Physic Garden, London’s oldest botanical garden with a collection of over 5,000 edible, medicinal and historical plants. If you’re interested in art, there’s a wealth of choice including the Serpentine Gallery, Tate Britain and the Saatchi Gallery. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Chelsea and what are their best dishes? Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, a three Michelin starred restaurant and one of London’s most highly rated, is located in Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea. If you’re a sushi lover like me, check out trendy Japanese restaurant, Kurobuta on the King’s Road. For somewhere, laid back super-stylish and a bit of celebrity spotting, The Ivy Chelsea Garden is also one of my favorites – and you simply have to try their chocolate bomb! Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? If you’re coming to London, you have to try afternoon tea at least once, I’d highly recommend the Italian themed afternoon tea at The Baglioni in nearby Kensington. For waffles and both sweet and savoury pancakes, check out My Old Dutch, London’s first ever pancake house founded in 1958. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Chelsea? If you like shopping you’ve definitely come to the right place in London.

Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. I love Bart’s, a difficult to find speakeasy-style bar with quirky décor and a cool cocktail list. I’d also recommend super glamourous, Beaufort House for a glass of champagne before you hit the town. If you end the night at a fancy club in Chelsea, which one do you head towards? Raffles night club is a Chelsea institution with a history of celebrity visitors, including royalty. A more recently opened hotspot is Tonteria, a Mexican themed bar and club where you can enjoy tapas and Tequila cocktails in fun and slightly outrageous environment."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-liverpool/,england,"Liverpool is responsible for breeding some legendary creative talents, there’s The Beatles, Cilla Black icons of British music as well as more current acts such as The Wombats and The Hummingbirds. It’s easy to see how the city earned its UNESCO City of Music Status. What makes Liverpool a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Before living in Liverpool my understanding of the city was tracksuits, perms and mustaches thanks to the Fast Show. That particular stereotype is long gone from the cosmopolitan streets that make up todays vibrant city centre. There are trendy independent districts like Bold Street and the Rope Walks. Albert Dock boasts an art gallery, museums and chic water side cocktail bars. There are endless rows of designer and high street stores. Liverpool One even has its own park bordered by an outdoor terrace and top brand chain restaurants. What 5 star hotel is the best in Liverpool? To be honest the 5 star hotels that are genuinely rated at 5 stars are nothing to brag about in Liverpool. There’s the usual Hilton and the Radisson but nowhere I would choose to say is the best. This may be due to my taste for the quirkiness but I believe if you want to enjoy your evening and like a taste of luxury the 4-star hotel Hard Days Night is perfect to get a taste of what Liverpool is all about. Click here for rates and availability.  The superb suites here, in particular the Lennon suite is completely white and a gleaming white grand piano in the centre of the suite. Even though not a 5 star rating this place gets a thumbs up in my book, and gives guests a taste of Beatle’s history to be experienced nowhere else in Liverpool. What about boutique hotels in Liverpool, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Having stayed in plenty of quirky hotels in my time I would say that the quirkier the better when it comes to boutique hotels. None in my mind beat 30 James Street -Home of the Titanic . The individual décor of each floor, themed around either the RMS Titanic, its passengers or its intended destination New York is astounding. In particular the first two floors of the hotel are clad completely in cushioned black leather. The rooms match this and behind each leather clad door guests will chic styling from the opulent furniture and lighting to the decadent marbled bathrooms. Click here for rates and availability.  I have stayed on numerous occasions and will always venture back there when avoiding a taxi fare home. I’ve even spoiled members of my family with all-inclusive dinner and accommodation offers, as the hotel also boasts a rooftop restaurant and cocktail bar The Carpathia. It honestly doesn’t get more glamorous than enjoying a cocktail a rooftop terrace whilst watching the starlight twinkling off the waters in the Albert Dock. Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Liverpool? Perhaps not considered luxurious but defiantly an adventure to be had at Industry.1, Liverpool’s Wake Park. Here you can learn to wakeboard before being towed down the Mersey at high speeds on a rubber ring. You’ll definitely get you hair wet but it’ll be worth it. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Liverpool? Making sure you get the most of Liverpool is easy as the city that is very compact and user friendly. You can see all the major tourist attractions in a day. That being said, on top of the museums and art galleries Liverpool is also home to one of the most stunning Victorian parks in England, Sefton Park. Here you could spend a day lounging in the sun or strolling around the Palm House which was once home to the rare and tropical plants imported from far off lands. If that doesn’t keep you busy all day then Lark Lane is a popular street worth a visit for some quirky boutique shops and top quality cuisines. A favorite of mine on Lark Lane is the Chili Banana, a superb spot to enjoy some amazing Thai cuisine and with a service to match. The best bit you have to try is the restaurants namesake a Chili Banana which is literally a banana fritter in sweet but hot chili sauce. Delicious. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Liverpool and what are their best dishes? My date nights usually consist of trying the newest place in Liverpool. As I’ve been everywhere else, literally. If I were to choose my all-time favorite, I’d struggle between three. Luche Libre offers great Mexican dishes with amazing cocktails and a wonderful service with a smile. The décor is rustic with plastic baskets and paper wrapped burritos on the menu. Great for spicing up any date night. My favorite dish is the fish tacos, something a little different that is quite light so you can load up on nachos spicy rice and wedges. For a real romantic setting I love the Italian Fish club at the top of Bold Street. Here the specialty is Italian style seafood, the best risotto I’ve ever eaten. My partner enjoyed their sea bass served with a samphire side smothered in a delicious garlic oil. There isn’t a thing on the menu I wouldn’t eat again. I’ve yet to try the sister restaurant simply named The Italian Club, but I imagine the service and food is similar. Finally, quite possibly the greatest Indian meal of my life was served in the Spice Lounge on Albert Dock. This amazing venue provides diners with the perfect ambiance from which to enjoy a thoroughly modern Indian meal. I enjoyed a delicious marinated lamb dish that was succulent and mouthwatering. What really makes this venue is the location, set against the historical Albert Dock dimly lit with a blue hue from the aquarium lights. A charmingly romantic and utterly stylish night out. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Liverpool’s sweet tooth craving are answered by a whole host of bakeries, deli’s and more recently luxury indulgent milkshake venues. My particular favorite guaranteeing sweet tooth satisfaction is Barley and Beans peanut butter freak shake topped with curly whirly, chocolate eclairs, a tiny cupcake a flap jack and lashings of whipped cream. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Liverpool who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Every shopper loves a trip to Liverpool, whether you’re after that one of a kind designer find or something quirky and classically vintage there is a shop for you in Liverpool. The Met Quarter on Whitechapel boasts big brands like Armani, Hugo Boss and All Saints. As well as being home to MAC makeup and Jo Malone, here is defiantly where a girl can indulge in her expensive side. There’s a huge area known as Liverpool one that is home to all the major high street brands as well as the odd high end name such as Michael Kors, Reiss and Radley. If you fancy a little something different, try and get your hands on that one of kind designer vintage find on Bold Street where there are a number of boutiques selling high quality and great value vintage designer pieces. Heading to Liverpool for a shop be sure to bring an empty suitcase and an extra set of carrying arms. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Liverpool? There is nothing more important to a Liverpool lady than their hair and make-up. Luckily there is an amazing business that perfectly caters for groups of ladies looking to get glammed up for an evening on the town. Peaches and Cream are an independent make up studio in the city centre who provide ladies with a VIP style service. No matter what your age or occasion the team at Peaches and Cream will leave you feeling like a star. Definitely worth a visit is Morgan’s Spa. This Liverpool hotel spa offers its visitors a chance to enjoy a host of amazing treatments from massages and facials to body contouring and champagne wraps. The spa itself is located in the depths of what was once the offices of the White Star Line the firm responsible for registering the RMS Titanic to sail. Hence the theme of the hotel and spa being based on the ill-fated Not only is Morgan’s Spa a fabulous retreat from the city it is also a chance to see inside a building with such and iconic reputation. Combine all this with a 40sqft hydrotherapy pool and you have the best spa experience in Liverpool. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Depending on what I was aiming to do during the time the sun is setting, there are only two places I would recommend. If you were hoping to enjoy a sunset meal, then Matou on the river front is the ideal choice. The delightful Pan Asian Restaurant and Bar offer diners a floor to ceiling view across the Mersey. My meal of choice here that perfectly complements the scenery is the Three Delicacies in White Wine Sauce washed down with a Chili and passionfruit martini. Superb! If you’ve already eaten, then a trip not to miss in the summer is an evening cruise across the Mersey on the world famous Mersey Ferry. Sailors are treated to spectacular views across the river as well as a unique perspective of the Three Graces bathe din the golden glow of the setting sun. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. My number one choice for pre-gaming drinks is Alma De Cuba. The exterior of the building is enough to get your glamour radar beeping. The venue is a former church which has been converted into a most chic and elegant cocktail bar and restaurant. On the upper terrace visitors can enjoy a fabulous meal in stylish surroundings then descend into the lower floor to begin their evening with a great choice of premium drinks. There is a certain decadence that comes hand in hand with the fiery Latino theme. Think ladies in feather headdresses and refreshing minty mojitos all coming together to provide a taste of southern American culture with a tropical Caribbean twist. If you end the night at a fancy club in Liverpool, which one do you head towards? The newest most exclusive VIP bar to open in Liverpool is Noctua. Located on Stanley Street next door to designer shopping mall the Met Quarter, Noctua has already welcomed some local and out of town celebrities and is the number one place to be seen in Liverpool. A member only access club that can be arranged prior to your visit guarantees a great mix of likeminded individuals all looking for a high-class night out. Drinks are off the highest quality as is the music and staff service."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-south-kensington/,england,"What makes South Kensington a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? South Ken (as it’s know to the locals) is all about old-world English charm and culture. With its world-class museums, quaint bookshops, and sweet cafes, it has an understated, real-world sophistication, while still maintaining a warm, neighborhood-y vibe. It’s a must for any anglophile.  Who lives in South Kensington? Any celebs to watch out for? Unlike some areas of London that are made up of tourists or commercial spaces, real Londoners actually live in South Kensington. There’s a notable French population present, as well as students and affluent families. South Kensington was home to many notable historical figures including Winston Churchill (28 Hyde Park Gate, SW7) and Alfred Hitchcock (153 Cromwell Road, SW5). Keep your eye out for rumored local residents, Stella McCartney, J.K. Rowling, and Hugh Grant. And we can’t forget about the most famous locals: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (a.k.a. Will and Kate and their children), who live nearby in Kensington Palace.  What 5 star hotel is the best in South Kensington? South Kensington has a bunch of wonderful hotels that mix 5-star style with boutique culture. Two of my favorites are the famous Blakes Hotel and the more undercover, Number Sixteen: The glamorous and lavish Blakes Hotel is a London institution and the ultimate boutique experience. Each room is individually styled to represent a different locale like Corfu or Paris. It’s a great place for a decadent splurge! Tucked away on a side street and discreetly labeled, Number Sixteen is more home than hotel. Yet with its courtyard garden, help-yourself honesty bar, and sunny library built for daydreaming—it’s anything but homely. This is a spot for quiet escapism. Where are the best hang outs during in South Kensington? South Ken is known for all the amazing, free museums. There’s the art, design, and fashion of the Victoria and Albert Museum; the kid-friendly Science Museum; and the always-fun Natural History Museum (which has enchanting ice rink out front in the winter!). There’s also Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, which are perfect for picnics or strolls any time of year. Speaking of strolling, locals love to have a wander through the small but sweet South Kensington Farmers’ Market, which takes place on Bute Street every Saturday. A lesser known hangout spot is Kensington Roof Gardens: Set atop the sixth floor of a Kensington High Street building, Sir Richard Branson’s Kensington Roof Gardens gives you 1.5 acres of themed gardens with real flamingos! Stop by at night for a drink on the terrace or dinner at its restaurant, Babylon. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in South Kensington and what are their best dishes? Check out Franco-Japanese fusion restaurant, L’Etranger. Go for the tasting menu and ask for a corner table. Let’s talk desserts in South Kensington- what place makes the best? Oddono’s makes artisan Italian gelato and is a must—especially in the summer. Also, we can’t talk desserts without mentioning South Ken’s French expats. Thanks to the presence of the French Consulate, Lycée Français, and the French Institute with it’s art house cinema, the area boasts some ooh la la -worthy pastries at many Parisian style cafes like the Kensington Crêperie.  Tell us all the hot shopping spots in South Kensington; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Most high-rolling shopping is done in nearby Knightsbridge (think: Harrods and Harvy Nichols), but booklovers will love to poke around the twee Slightly Foxed; the arty South Kensington Books; or browse the French books at Librairie la Page. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in South Kensington? British Vogue calls Sarah Chapman’s Skinesis Clinic “the home of arguably one of the best facials you’ll ever have.” For a little something different, try the marble Turkish hammam at Le Kalon Spa, at The Bentley Hotel.  Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? The ornate and formidable Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens is a great spot to watch the sky turn dark as the moment lights up. It doesn’t hurt that it has a romantic backstory: It was commission by Queen Victory to honor her beloved husband, as their royal marriage was actually a well-suited, tender match. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks in South Kensington or a great pre-gaming spot. Barts is a speakeasy-style cocktail den that serves eclectic and eccentric cocktails out of things like top hats. Bar 190 (in the Gore Hotel) has an intimate and historic feel (it hosted a Rolling Stones album launch in 1968). If you’re into wine, you’ll be spoiled for choice: Try the Spanish spot Fernandez &amp; Wells for wine and a charcuterie plate. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? The young royals are known to hang out at members-only, always buzzy Boujis. If clubbing is not your bag, the historic Royal Albert Hall hosts everything from classical concerts to top pop acts."https://hippie-inheels.com/offbeat-london-destinations/,england,"7 Offbeat London Destinations You Won’t Want to Miss! Think that London just consists of the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, and Buckingham Palace? Think again! The city is absolutely full of hidden gems and offbeat London destinations you won’t want to miss on any trip to the Big Smoke. You just need to know where to look. After all, once you’ve wandered along the Thames and snapped a few photos of the Houses of Parliament, you’ll want to see where the locals really hang out. Here are five offbeat London destinations you won’t want to miss on a visit to the city Read More: Best Instagram locations in London Wander around the Mews of London Okay, this first one isn’t really a single destination per se but more of a collection of places to see and visit. Feel like you’re in a real-life vintage movie and wander through the mews of London. Located for the most part in areas of London such as South Kensington, Mayfair and Notting Hill the ‘mews’ of London are the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily London life. These small streets were originally home to stables when the city of London ran on horse and cart. Today, these stables have been converted to some of the chicest properties the city has to offer. Some of my favorite mews to wander along include Dunworth Mews and Redcliffe Mews. Visit the Monument to the Great Fire of London One of the best ways to see a city is from above, and London is no exception. While a visit to the Sky Garden usually needs to be booked a couple of weeks in advance, a visit to the nearby Great Fire of London Monument usually consists of little more than a half hour queue. Sure, it’s not quite as high as the Walkie Talkie building, but at 61 meters high, the monument is hardly short! Entry is priced at under a fiver (£5) and from the top, you can see the city of London’s skyline in all its glory. From the Shard to St Paul’s to Tower Bridge, the view across the Thames is truly phenomenal; particularly on a sunny day! Go Vintage Shopping at Portobello Road Market From offbeat finds to quirky designers, there’s a whole treasure trove (or should that be shopping basket?) worth of vintage stuff waiting to be worn, discovered and loved at Portobello Road Market . Situated near Notting Hill every weekend hundreds of stalls pop up along Portobello Road. There’s everything from yummy food stands to antique dealers to pretty jewelry. Even if you’re not looking to buy anything, it’s still worth a look around. Read more: Luxury guide to London &amp; Luxury guide to Chelsea Purchase a new read at an independent bookstore London is not only a great place to go vintage shopping, but it’s full of independent bookstores (both vintage and modern) dotted around the city. On a rainy day, there is nothing I enjoy more than wandering into one of these stores and spending hours perusing the shelves, looking for a new read. Bookstores I highly recommend wandering around include Hurlingham Books ( 91 Fulham High St, Fulham, London SW6 3JS ), and Skoob Books ( 66 Brunswick Square, Bloomsbury, London WC1N ). Grab a drink with friends in Camden! In the past few years alone, cocktail culture in the Big Smoke has just grown and grown. And the place to be? Camden. Vintage stores line the canal, as well as quirky eateries and a whole host of bars and pubs to suit almost any budget. My favourite bar in the area is probably Fifty-Five Bar (31 Jamestown Rd, Camden Town, London NW1 7DB). They serve a huge variety of delicious cocktails. Ranging from your typical Mojito to more unusual dessert concoctions, you’re sure to find something you like! Check out a smaller museum: there are over 200 to choose from! Sure, everyone’s heard of the British Museum and the Natural History Museum, but did you know that there are over 200 museums? Many of these are smaller, house style museums, focusing on a particular interest or topic. From the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum where Fleming first discovered the lifesaving antibiotic that is penicillin, to the cartoon museum, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Even if you’re ‘not a museum person’, I’m sure you’ll find something you enjoy! The museum pictured below is the Sir John Soane’s Museum (13 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3BP).  A former architect who designed notable sites of interest around the city including the Bank of England, Sir John Soane left his house to the nation when he died. Today, the museum is free to visit and you aren’t allowed to take pictures inside, or even keep your phone switched on! It’s the perfect place to escape busy city life, if only for a few hours… Pop into Neal’s Yard Located in the very heart of London’s zone one, you’ll find a small alleyway by the name of ‘Neal’s Yard’. In fact, this is not one lane, but three tiny alleyways converging in a completely adorable little enclave. And when I say ‘little’, I really mean tiny. Make sure to arrive early in the morning, or on a weekday because even a few people here make the place seem crowded. Colorful shopfronts and independent eateries make up this small space. It’s a lovely place to enjoy a bite to eat and forget you’re in London altogether."https://hippie-inheels.com/london-packing-list-for-the-fall/,england,"London Packing List for the Fall / Autumn If you read my last post on what’s new in my world , then you know I just headed back to Europe for a bit and my bestie, Arielle, is finally met Ben! This also means I was in England for late summer/early fall, which is  very  different from late summer/early fall in Goa. Here’s my full London packing list for the fall so you know what to pack for this time of year too! London Packing List for the Fall Quick Things to Note: Late summer/early fall in England is literally a toss-up. One day, in St. Ives I laid at the beach and got a sunburn BUT at the same time, you couldn’t get in the sea without a wet suit and the wind was fierce. Other days, I had on jeans, boots, a long sleeve shirt, and leather jacket and was still a bit cold walking outside.

I actually packed this purse in my luggage and only carried my tote on the plane. Since this wasn’t a “blogging” trip, I had a lot less tech equipment to take with me.

There is no shortage of places to stay, dine and visit – being so close to London (approx. 90 minutes) the area caters for the discerning city slicker as well as visitors from overseas or those looking for a relaxing break in the country with some outdoor exploring.   Whether you are looking for luxurious privacy, a boutique retreat or some water or land-based adventure – it’s easy to find here.   With such a good choice of luxury hotels there is of course a plethora of fantastic restaurants to enjoy too.   I may be biased but the area gives the best of both worlds – close enough to London, but in easy distance of the sea and the great outdoors. What 5 star hotel is the best in New Forest? The Chewton Glen wins hands down ( review here ) – the UKs grand dame.   The hotel is elegant, timeless and quintessentially British, but it is also moving with the times.   Sweeping up the long drive you will appreciate how large the grounds are.   If you look carefully through the trees you may even spot some of the exquisite and private tree houses which are a relatively new and luxurious addition to the hotel – hot tub on the deck, wood burning stoves, breakfast delivered through a hatch door for complete privacy.   The suites and rooms in the main house are no less luxurious and are sumptuously decorated.  Click here for rates and availability.  Many have terraces or open up onto the lawns.   The grounds here are gorgeous with plenty of places to relax and it is just a short walk down the valley to the beach.   There are indoor and outdoor pools as well as a fantastic spa and hydrotherapy pool.   Dining here, as you might expect, is fantastic – it is a relatively formal set-up but this suits the character of the grand house.   There is also an oak paneled set of rooms that house the bar which are so welcoming and warm in the winter for pre-dinner or after-dinner drinks. What about boutique hotels in New Forest, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Hotel TerraVina is where I would send a friend to stay.   It is a short drive from Ashurst Station which is on the mainline train route from London, just on the edge of the New Forest.   With only 11 rooms the hotel has a real feel of staying at a country house – albeit a modern one with everything a guest could wish for including an outdoor pool, terraces attached to many rooms and stylish décor unique to the property.  Click here for rates and availability.  The owners, Gerard and Nina Bassett, used to own Hotel du Vin but took this on as a new and personal challenge.   As you might expect from the former ‘world’s best sommelier’ the wine list is extraordinary and varied and having dined here on many occasions the menu is always interesting, varied, local and the chef team seem to revel in being challenged by food allergies (nowhere else have I been offered a choice of 3 different dairy-free desserts that could be made to order). Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in New Forest? The area spoils us with so many miles of coastline and forest to enjoy.   Cycling or horse-riding in the New Forest is a perfect day out in the summer, with plenty of choice of country pubs for a hearty lunch to boost energy.   It is easy to hire bikes or arrange a hack – with so much choice, each hotel will have their own recommendations.   Through the summer there are regular Polo events at the New Park grounds near Brockenhurst.   Our personal favourite pastime though is to head out onto the water. We always pick Lymington Yacht Charters for a boat as they have some elegant and comfortable boats for charter and you can enjoy the Solent and perhaps visit Yarmouth or Cowes.   Alternatively you could take a trip on a speedboat and see the Solent at pace! Where are the best hang outs during the day in New Forest? For beaches then there are a couple of choices if you know where to find them – we normally head to these in the winter for a walk but they will be equally lovely in the summer.   Lepe Beach and Country Park has a fascinating naval history as this is where the troops practiced for D-Day walking west from the car parks takes you to a quieter area at the entrance to the Beaulieu River and the beach is stunning and peaceful.   Hurst Castle Spit is another spot with plenty of history to it as well – it’s a good walk out to the castle along the shingle spit, or   a stroll along the sea wall around to Lymington.   After a bracing walk there is nothing better than a good lunch and the area is blessed with gastro pubs – The East End Arms, The Master Builders and Monty’s Inn will all look after you superbly (we particularly enjoy the riverside walk between 2 nd and 3 rd of these pubs). On a summers day it is always possible to find a quiet corner in the forest for a picnic and games.   There are hundreds of free car parks dotted across the park and plenty of well made footpaths to follow. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in New Forest and what are their best dishes? I really enjoy going to eat at Hartnett Holder &amp; Co which is part of the Limewood Hotel and offers relaxed dining based in one of the most stylish hotels in the area – there is nothing stuffy or pretentious whatsoever about eating here.   A fantastic menu – full of sharing options and homely dishes.   The seating is some of the most comfortable I have found in a restaurant.   There is also a lovely bar, and also a spa – it is marvelous to spend an afternoon being pampered before supper! Another option would be to eat at The Thatched Cottage in Brockenhurst.   This is a quaint little rickety place with quirky furniture and all set out in a little cottage.   There is however nothing rickety about the food and wine list, we have always been very impressed when we have visited. It is perfect for a winter supper – roaring fire, romantic lighting – it’s a very special place. Somewhere always getting rave reviews is The Pig in Lyndhurst.   Personally I haven’t had a good experience there, but I will give it another try someday soon – in the summer there is courtyard relaxed dining and all year round a more formal restaurant too which is very proud of knowing the provenance of all its food and sourcing as much from the local area as possible. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in New Forest and who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  I wouldn’t say we have designer hotspots but there is plenty of choice for a spot of shopping.   For an enjoyable day out with a selection of shops beyond the normal high street then head to Winchester or Lymington – these are definitely the most pleasant places for some retail therapy and you will be spoilt for choice with coffee shops and lunch venues too.   Beaulieu has some lovely little gift shops and it’s one of the places we always pop to in the run up to Christmas. Time for a great sunset view in New Forest… where would you go? Hurst Castle and Lepe Beach are superb locations as they both have a great aspect for enjoying the sunset, perhaps with a sundowner-picnic.   I just love the reflected sunlight across the water.   Sunsets out at sea can be spectacular if you get the chance to take a charter from somewhere like Lymington.   There are some high points in the forest that give you a real ‘big sky’ view of sunset, if ever we are driving across the forest at the right time we’ll pull in to the nearest car park and enjoy sunset in the wilderness!   For sunset with a sundowner – then my two recommendations would be either The Marine in Milford on Sea or The Haven in Lymington Yacht Haven.   Both of these have roof terraces and are a perfect place to make the most of the final hours of sunshine.

The rink is open from 17 November until 2 January, with hourly sessions between 10am and 10.15pm (sometimes earlier, sometimes later). Price : From £7.50 when booked in advance. 2. Check out the Lord Mayor’s show and fireworks. Because it’s such an extravagant, cosmopolitan, utterly over-the-top affair, it would be all too easy to assume that the annual Lord Mayor’s Show was a relatively modern tradition. Admittedly, back in the 13th century the parade may not have featured 7,000 international performers, 200 horses or 150 floats in an explosion of music and colour on quite this scale, but it’s always been a huge spectacle. On the morning of 12 November at 8.30am, a vast floating river pageant will set off from near Westminster Bridge, floating slowly downriver. Following this at 11am, the performers, dancers and acrobats will begin to snake in procession from Bank to Aldgate via St. Paul’s Cathedral, all returning to their starting point via Queen Victoria Street by around 2.30pm. As night draws in and to finish of the day, be sure to join the revellers congregating on the Victoria Embankment and South Bank for a spectacular free fireworks display at 5.15pm, all launched from a boat between Blackfriars Bridge and Waterloo Bridge. Price : FREE. Looking to save more money in your London trip? Check out YHAs list of moneysaving London hacks : 3. Grab a bite at East London’s Urban Food Fest. While London’s reputation for international cuisine could hardly climb any higher, sometimes the delights of quality cosmopolitan cooking doesn’t come cheap at the city’s hundreds of recommended restaurants. So why not head out east on Saturday night to sample fantastic flavours and cheap eats from every corner of the globe. Situated in a wonderfully transformed Shoreditch car park, the Urban Food Fest turns out to be even better than a restaurant – this is a pop-up foodie party, with free entry, complete with entertainment and sounds from bands rising fast on the scene. Street food is served direct from stalls and vans and includes everything from Brazilian chorizo wraps and spicy Korean chicken burgers to pad thai and Belgian waffles. Urban Food Fest is open from noon ‘til midnight every Saturday at Euro Car Parks, 163-175 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6HU. 4. Lose yourself in Hyde Park’s Winter Wonderland. There’s something about a winter fair that’s uniquely Christmassy and unmistakably London. In the coldest winters up until the early 1800s, they used to hold ‘Frost Fairs’ out on the thick ice of the frozen River Thames, moving attractions, sideshows and even roast chestnut stalls right out on to the ice. That’s the long London tradition which is continued today at Hyde Park’s Winter Wonderland , where revelers gather to wander through brightly lit markets, marvel at jaw-dropping circus shows and sip on a mulled wine or two at one of the site’s hundreds of unique bars and stalls. All the old-time fairground favourites are here too as well as a huge ice rink and even a ‘Magical Ice Kingdom’ where you can go fishing with Inuits and grab a selfie with a polar bear. Entry is free so it’s very much a must-see attraction if you’re in the Hyde Park area. 5. Discover Greenwich Park and its stunning Observatory. If you’re after a scenic winter walk in one of London’s most iconic settings, then a visit to the oldest enclosed royal park in Greenwich should not be missed. Offering unrivalled views across the Thames and over London’s ever-growing city skyline, the scenery really comes alive during the autumn and winter months as the leaves start to fall and frost begins to form. The park is also home to the Royal Observatory , where visitors can stand on either side of the Greenwich Meridian Line and discover the spot where every latitude and time zone on Earth is measured. The museum is open to the public throughout the year and a £9.50 ticket will ensure entry to the Observatory’s historic Flamsteed House, Astronomy Centre, Time Galleries, Meridian Line Courtyard and Meridian Building. If you’re looking to combine a scenic winter walk with a unique piece of British history for under ten pounds, then look no further than Greenwich Park."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-sheffield/,england,"What makes Sheffield a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? It’s the sort of place you would never think of when you plan a getaway and that’s what I love about this city. It’s only 2 hours by train from London yet it feels a world away. It’s full of historical boutique hotels and budding new restaurants without the major price tag of the capital. What 5 star hotel is the best in Sheffield? Halifax Hall is by far my favorite plush hotel in town. An old steel baron’s estate, the home has been renovated, but maintains the period charm of the late 19th century. It’s full of rich gem tones and plush beds which you’ll need after their decadent Sunday lunch. Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in  Sheffield , of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Definitely Brocco in the Park . The rooms are full of luxuries – brass baths, huge luscious beds, views of Endcliffe Park and Nespresso machines for a perfect morning cup. They also do a lavish afternoon tea with cream scones and prosecco. Click here for rates and availability.  Where are the best hang outs during the day in  Sheffield There are so many lovely cafe’s in Sheffield. My favorite has to be Tamper Coffee. Owned and operated by New Zealand expats, they’ve brought the best of kiwi coffee culture to South Yorkshire. They also do a killer brunch. Steam Yard is another great cafe that does coffee right and when the weather’s nice you can sit out in their courtyard. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Sheffield and what are their best dishes? Silversmiths is the best around. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is that everything is as local as possible. Cheeses are from Yorkshire, meats are locally sourced, and there’s an ever changing menu to suit the vegetables of the season. They have a seriously extensive cocktail menu, and a pie and steak night that I thought would be your standard pub grub, but was so, so much more. Location: 111 Arundel Street,  Sheffield,  S1 2NT Let’s talk desserts in  Sheffield – what place makes the best? That’s so tough. It has to be a toss up between Steam Yard’ s doughnuts and the cakes at Cat Lane Bakery (they also do some SERIOUSLY good homemade bread). Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designersin Sheffield? My favorite shops are down Division Street in the Devonshire Quarter. The Forum has an incredible vintage shop called Vulgar. Then there’s Cow, another vintage shop where I always walk out with something because the selection is simply perfection. Head to Fargate for big brands like H&amp;M and Topshop or walk down to The Moor for the department stores and sheffield’s amazing covered market. Location:  COW Sheffield,  156-160 West Street,  S1 4ES What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Sheffield? Spa 1877  is the sort of place you accidentally spend the whole day (or week). It’s an authentic Turkish bath, they do massages, waxing, facials, threading and have a huge selection of complete packages which usually include a nice light lunch. Location: 67 Victoria St, Sheffield S3 7QD Time for a great sunset view in Sheffield… where would you go? If you’re looking for a really jaw dropping place to watch the sunset, hop in the car and drive west for a few miles into the Peak District. The sun setting over these craggy, green hills is by far the best place to nature spot in Sheffield. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Sheffield is certainly not lacking in pubs and bars. I prefer a few craft beers or ales so usually head to Sheffield Tap next to the train station. They have 11 hand pull taps and I always get a new tasty beer when I’m there."https://hippie-inheels.com/tunbridge-wells-guide/,england,"A Little Tunbridge Wells Guide If I had to choose between living in London or Tunbridge Wells, I would choose Tunbridge Wells (and Ben would tell me I was effing crazy). I am not really into the hustle bustle of cities and the metro in London was seriously as crowded as Indian transport during rush hour. Tunbridge Wells had charm, was easy to get around, and had unique boutique shops, art galleries and adorable pubs that served really good English food! Ben grew up in “Royal” Tunbridge Wells and his mom now lives in Tonbridge (why the spelling in different, I don’t know). It’s royal because Queen Victoria &amp; Prince Albert used to vacation there as a kid. It was famous before then because of a hot  chalybeate spring  that people used to come for a “spa”. The water was believed to have healing properties so people would come to have a sip. Word spread to the Royals, which is why they ventured to Tunbridge Wells. The well is still there, although empty while we visited and the surrounding area is called the Pantiles. It’s a great place to walk around, shop, and have dinner. They do a jazz night every Thursday as well. During World War 2, Tunbridge Wells was actually a place of refuge for all the people escaping London’s bombings. It’s also been called the “Garden of England”. With all the royalty in and out of Tunbridge Wells, it’s not surprising that a royal mansion near Calverley Park was turned into a hotel. Hotel Du Vin &amp; Bistro invited Ben and I to stay, so we popped in for a night. The rooms were perfect and classy and I highly recommend staying there! They offer movie nights in the summer with themes like Italian, English, French, etc where the movie matches the food. We didn’t have the right time frame to fit it in, so ate at the Bistro. Being the classy gal I am, I got a cheesburger. Ben had a steak and I was really jealous that I wasn’t smart enough to order that too! Not that I don’t love a cheeseburger, but I ordered one everywhere I went. Ben loved this Old Mout Cider so much that he bought 3 and packed them for India. Luckily they didn’t break and he actually had one tonight here in Goa! The hotel is known for amazing wine, but other than our drink at dinner we were detoxing from all the drinking we were doing and just wanted to lie in and watch a movie (the Minions.. it was cute). I love eggs Benedict and am determined to learn to make it myself! Breakfast in England is always so much food… which is not a complaint. Ben had a bath, which was his favorite part about the hotel. English people and their baths… so weird. The bar and bistro were packed full of people and I’ve been told this hotel is a popular place for fancy dining or date nights. You definitely need to reserve a table. Lots of people go for Sunday Brunch, which Ben’s family recently did for his grandma’s 80th birthday just the week before we went. Ben’s friends live there and took us to all their favorite pubs and restaurants. I mean, we had Dominoes and fast food too of course! Ha ha, Ben and I always have to get our fix when we are out of India. Some of the best meals, his mom and Mick cooked! I love an English style Sunday Roast… and I love English cauliflower and cheese. According to Ben’s friends the best pubs are the Chaser (pictured above) and Checkers Inn where we had such a good dinner – cauliflower cheese, bangers and mash, salad, goats cheese starters, pork belly, and lots more. We stayed a few nights at Ben’s bestie Mitch’s house (and his wife Laura and their cute twins Lucy and Amber… who stayed shy even a week later!). After a night of boozing, the next day we woke up craving ribs so what to do..? Go out and buy them! Mitch made them with a sticky cola BBQ sauce and we ate ourselves into a coma. Ben’s mom’s roasts were delicious! I took a photo of the pork roast we had the week after, but it didn’t really turn out or at least show off how yummy it tastes. All the veggies used came from their own garden! It was all so good and I finally had a Yorkshire pudding I liked.. then I had 3 more. The trip wouldn’t be complete without a trip to Bluewater so I could shop. Being boys, they had 5 guys burgers with me, left me there so they could gokart, then came back just in time for Krispy Kreme.  We drove out to see Ben’s grandma and her husband Peter at their house (THE CUTEST HOUSE EVER!!) and their huge 50 pound dogs. The towers on her house were used back in the day to dry out hops for beer… how cool is that? All in all we had a great time and we can’t wait to go back!"https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-for-visiting-helsinki/,finland,"Helsinki is easy to get around and not somewhere that’s difficult to travel, like most European cities. But its way up North so people get nervous! Here’s a little intro to Helsinki to help you get ready for your trip. This is titled my “handful of tips for visiting Helsinki” instead of a guide to Helsinki for a reason. I was only there for a week, so I didn’t really get to see everything there is to see. I will share everything I know, though! Finnish people come off a little shy and maybe more like introverts as they often joke about. But, unlike other places in Europe where they do double cheek kisses, they mostly offered me huge hugs! Helsinki, to me, had a very hipster vibe. It is hard to sight-see and have the energy to go out because it was only sunny like 4-5 hours of the day. When people visit Finland they go for Helsinki, the North (Lapland), the Lake region (Turku), and the Places for tourists to see in Helsinki I feel like in Helsinki its more about just experiencing life rather than seeing landmarks, but there are some places you might want to check out. Helsinki Cathedral – It seems like this is the biggest attraction. It is pretty impressive but I only saw it in the dark.  In the Sokos Hotel on the 10th floor is a restaurant called Loiste. A local told me it had the best viewpoint and she was right! Visit a sauna! You HAVE to do this in Finland because they invented them and it’s a serious part of their lives (seriously… they are mad about them). There is a huge modern public sauna called Loyly that we went to. You eat dinner, sauna, jump in an ice lake, and drink.  If you walk to Aleksanterinkatu Road, you’ll see the Christmas lights while you do some shopping. It’s great! You can also check out the Ateneum Art Museum, Kamppi Chapel of Silence which is a gathering place, Old Market Hall to see the local produce and seafood, and visit the Suomenlinna Sea Fortress (UNESCO site) which I saw other bloggers do and their photos were amazing. Day Trips from Helsinki There is SO much to see outside of the city center and I highly recommend you focus on that rather than being in Helsinki all the time. There are SO many day trips and you can see them all in the Finnair stopover program as it’s their focus. I got to do two as part of the Nordic Bloggers Experience and I’ll be writing about that in two separate upcoming posts: Vantaa &amp; Piece of Forest . Here is a list of the day trips  that you can take outside of Helsinki. Food in Helsinki I found that food here reminded me of the freshness of Latvia. Breakfasts were yogurt, rye breads, muesli, berries, and fruit. Meals consisted often times of reindeer, salmon, and potatoes. On Finnair they offer blueberry juice and they even put blueberry flavour into their tea. Finns are OBSESSED with coffee. It’s a full addiction over there. They also drink it out of the cutest little wooden cups that many of them carry around. Seriously! We had a great meal and party at a place called Shelter. Getting to Helsinki &amp; Away I came from India, so for fellow India-based people, you can fly Jet Airways to London, Paris, or Amsterdam and connect from there. I connected with KLM (their code share partners), but you can also connect with Finnair and other airlines. I’ve flown Jet dozens of times over the years. There are many reasons I keep going back to them. They allow two pieces of 23 kilo luggage which is ideal especially when I fly from the USA. Most airlines have cracked down on this. They route through Europe and fly 46 destinations within India and 20 more globally. They are international, so have that type of customer service, therefore even their domestic flights are always my top choice. To Amsterdam from India, they fly the newest Boeing 777 and it’s NICE! haha, I love a new plane! They have JetScreen. You can download the airtime player app and watch TV shows and movies on your tablet or phone during the flight on the short connection planes that don’t have TV’s. On the long flights they have tons of new movies. Indian hospitality in luxury hotels and airlines is always top-notch. The food is designed by location so if you go to the Netherlands it will be Dutch wheras flying to India, it’s Indian. If you’re coming from the USA, you might consider Finnair as they have a stopover program and you can go onward through Helsinki. I checked out the Finnair Lounge when I left Helsinki as they invited all of us bloggers to try it. The food was good, chairs were comfortable and I had cocoa – but it was very crowded and noisy as it was in a small space. There are taxis around town, but you can also download and use Uber while in Helsinki. I partnered with Helsinki Limo (not in an actual limo) and they arranged my airport pickup and drop-off, which is great for business travelers. You can walk almost anywhere in the city center. It’s not very big. There are also local buses, trams, metro, and trains you can take to get outside the city center. I noticed bicycle lanes too but didn’t see any rental places. *During my layover in Amsterdam, I stayed at the Hilton Airport Hotel  because I had 12 hours and it was just a 3-minute walk from the terminal. It was my first time staying at an airport hotel! I will definitely do that again. So much better than being exhausted in a lounge. Where to Stay in Helsinki F6 Hotel I stayed here just one night before heading off to Oulu. It’s the newest boutique hotel in Helsinki. I wasn’t asked to, but liked it so much I wrote a whole review about it. Forenom Apartments These are “pop-up” apartments that many of the bloggers stayed at. I didn’t. Sylvia from Heart My Backpack did and said it was nice but basic. Breakfast wasn’t included here. Klaus K Hotel I stayed at Klaus K Hotel for 5 nights. It was a great hotel. The breakfast was SO good. The rooms were a little small, but I think I had the lowest rate room, so you can always upgrade. The location was great and it’s a design hotel. Clarion Hotel This is brand new and has a crazy amazing pool. We went here just for the closing party but many bloggers stayed here and raved about their huge rooms and bathtubs! I hope you’ve enjoyed my little tips for visiting Helsinki. There is so much nature and beauty to see just outside the city center, so don’t let the darkness get you feeling like it’s not a cool place. It’s got a LOT to offer (and some killer coffee shops)."https://hippie-inheels.com/packing-finland-winter-dont-make-mistakes/,finland,"Packing For Finland in Winter – Don’t Make the Mistakes I Did When you live in Southern India, you don’t have a lot of options of clothing for cold weather, especially attempting packing for Finland in winter. So, I did the best I could and because I was highly unprepared, I can help you know what to pack – because I definitely knew what I was missing out on! The key is layering. Packing for Finland in Winter TOPS So, for tops you don’t really have to over think it. I don’t have “warm” tops and I was fine because I layered with a tank top and wore a really warm coat. While in Finland, even in Oulu (arctic) I was okay and as you can see, my tops weren’t exactly winter friendly! What you SHOULD take: 2 layering tops, like thermals! This is literally all I had to work with (ha!) I don’t think the reindeer noticed. BOTTOMS This is where I do recommend going all “traveler” and getting legitimate winter pants to keep you warm. With t-shirts and tank tops layered under my tops, I was warm up top but jeans only cut it in Helsinki. What you SHOULD take: warmer leggings made for cold weather. Once I got further North, the jeans just weren’t warm enough. 3/4 the pairs did not have holes by the way (lol). They were too tight for leggings underneath. A lot of the Nordic girls had on special black leggings that were made for cold weather and really warm. I was too jealous! North Face makes a pair of warm winter tights . SWEATERS Over my tank top, t-shirt, and long-sleeve shirt, I wore sweaters. The ones below did fine. I didn’t need the leather jacket because it definitely wasn’t warm enough, but it was all I had for transit. I had a coat delivered directly to Finland to wear over all this! What you SHOULD take: 2 wool sweaters! If they aren’t wool then just some that are really warm. Below are all the leggings I took. I needed two pairs one for the flight there, and one for the flight back. The extra pairs were unnecessary because I didn’t work out and they didn’t fit under my jeans. The OTHER stuff Undies, bras, and yes a swimsuit (okay 3). Finnish people love saunas. It’s literally their thing. There are saunas in the little cottages in the middle of nowhere, in every hotel, and even in hotel bathrooms sometimes. They sit in the sauna and fry then jump in the freezing cold arctic temperature lakes. It’s insane, and yes I did it (and hated it). What you SHOULD take: I have a pair of DarnTough Wool socks in America that I was dying for! I ended up buying wool socks. 100% necessary. COAT The coat is SO important. I worked with Arctic Bay as a partner on this trip to Finland because I wanted a legitimate parka. It was perfect and kept me really warm, but of course, it would at the price tag. I was so lucky to have this coat. LUGGAGE I took my Delsey 25″ Helium check-in luggage. Shoes take up the most space, and I”ll get to those later. I use eBags packing cubes which are basically my favorite thing ever and if you don’t have them yet, you’re missing out. SHOES &amp; BOOTS I took 4 pairs of shoes. Steve Madden black ankle boot UGG brown boots (lifesavers) UGG suede tan shoes (could have left, only wore them once. UGG black high top sneakers (favorite &amp; great for the plane!). Cold Weather Accessories You can’t forget things like hats and gloves. I recommend taking actual winter gloves you would use for skiing or playing in the snow, not just cotton ones. For hats, any wool hat will work! My hood was really good, but it was still important to have a hat. TOILETRIES I took the basics! Wet Brush which detangles like a charm Tungbrush because I love fresh breath! Clarasonic Mia Fit … absolutely needed this for how the cold damaged and dried out my skin. Dr. Brandt oxygen facial Clinique moisture surge Bumble &amp; Bumble shampoo and conditioner travel set Darphin facial oil (Moisturizer wasn’t enough for this dry weather and this oil was amazing. I wear it to bed at night.) TECH Well, I won’t bore you with the details since you can see it below and there is SO much of it. I took a small backpack that I could use daily during all the hikes we did (camera gear doesn’t fit in a purse anymore. I had to take a rolling carry-on because I had so much techy stuff I didn’t want to put in my checked luggage. I took way too much stuff to Finland! Some of the important/new things below are: Gorilla tripod (super cool, ben got it for me for Christmas) TEP device Panasonic Gx80."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2014/11/walk-from-arc-de-triomphe-to-louvre-museum-paris-france/,france,"8 Tourist Attractions from Champs-Élysées to The Louvre: A Paris Walking Tour With a paper plate of chocolate-banana chocolat banane waffle in one hand, I surveyed the park for a vacant seat and found one punctuating a grove of manicured trees. Sweet , I whispered as I pulled a chair and settled. The scene was just as cliché as I imagined, but, heck, I was loving it. I was enjoying waffles in one corner of the Tuileries Garden and listening to Lana del Rey while keeping my eyes on that pointy metal structure that poked the Parisian sky — the Eiffel Tower.       View of the Eiffel Tower from one edge of the Tuileries Garden But the world-famous landmark would have to wait at that point. It was my first day in Paris, and the tower was not yet part of the plan. That afternoon was reserved for Champs-Élysées, ending here at the Tuileries Garden. Just in front of me was Place de la Concorde, Paris’s largest public square. The place is peaceful now. Over 200 years ago, however, it was the site of one of the most important events in French history. This was where King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were executed by guillotine. Today, the only commotion that occurs here is that of tourists finding a good spot for a quick rest after hours of sightseeing. My walk began at the other end of Champs-Élysées, a 1.9-km long boulevard that connects Place de la Concorde and Place Charles de Gaulle. A stroll along the famed avenue introduces many of the city’s most popular tourist spots. Here are some of them.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Arc de Triomphe 2. Champs-Élysées 3. Fashion Stores 4. Grand Palais 5. Jardins des Champs-Élysées 6. Place de la Concorde 7. Tuileries Garden 8. The Louvre Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Arc de Triomphe Arc de Triomphe has its own metro station called Charles-de-Gaulle-Étoile , making it an ideal start of a walking tour. Smack at the center of Place Charles de Gaulle in the 8th arrondissement, it enables a great view of Champs-Élysées. Looks small but… Voila. It’s a pretty colossal structure. The Arc is one of the most iconic monuments in Paris. Erected between 1806 and 1836, it was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte after the victory at Austerlitz and was designed by Jean Chalgrin in honor of those who fought at the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Names of generals and all French victories are inscribed on the structure. I had a foolish impression before coming here that the arc was small (I don’t know why) and was, thus, surprised to be greeted by a Neoclassical mammoth. It measures 50 meters in height, 45 meters in length, and 22 meters in width.   2. Champs-Élysées The boulevard itself is worth a look. Each year, it plays host to many Bastille Day (July 14) events including a military parade. On regular days, it boasts rectangular groves that fringe a maze of retail shops, theaters, and restaurants. Champs Elysees is one busy road. Pavement restaurants amid tree groves Champs Elysees is flanked by fashion shops and boutiques. So tempted to just run around and disturb their peace, haha There was a time when Champs-Élysées was just a flat shade of green on the map: fields and gardens. The initial plan, made by André Le Nôtre in 1667, pegged the site to be just an extension of the nearby Tuileries Garden. Over centuries, it has evolved into one of the most famous and most fashionable streets in the world.   3. Fashion Stores The area has become synonymous with shopping. Shopping has been ingrained in its history, starting in 1860 when the merchants along the boulevard established an association. Now called Comité Champs-Élysées, “it is the oldest standing committee in Paris,” according to my good friend Wikipedia. Flagship store of Louis Vuitton Popular brands and luxury labels are all here, including the flagship store of Louis Vuitton, which stands proudly on the southern side of the road.   4. Grand Palais Another important historic site along Champs-Élysées is the Grand Palais, a “monument dedicated by the Republic to the glory of French art.” The grand, imposing structure edifice houses an exhibition hall and a museum complex. The Beaux-Arts beauty also serves as the venue for many of Chanel’s fashion shows. As viewed from Champs Elysees Built in 1897, the palace wears a blend of Classical and Art Nouveau designs, most evident in its stone facade and ironwork, as well as in its grand staircase. The most eye-catching are its glass barrel-vaulted roofs, framed by light steel, allowing natural light in. Just across the Grand Palais is the Petit Palais.   5. Jardins des Champs-Élysées At this point, you’ll probably be exhausted from all the hours of walking. Fret not! Beyond the groves of trees that line the avenue are pockets of greens, perfect for a brief rest. Some statues and fountains adorn the gardens. But you might want to spend a few euros on a serving of crepe from the unassuming stalls that hide under the foliage. Jealousy. Groves of trees fringing the avenue One of the many creperies along the avenue A human statue amuses a passerby   6. Place de la Concorde The largest public square in Paris, the Place de la Concorde spans 8.64 hectares at the eastern end of Champs-Élysées. Its most prominent feature: the Obelisk of Luxor, a giant needle-shape Egyptian monument at the very center of the site. The obelisk is flanked by the Fontaines de la Concorde, designed by Jacques Ignace Hittorff. But the place itself was laid out Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1755 in honor of King Louis XV. One of the two Fontaines de la Concorde The Obelisk of Luxor At the height of the French Revolution, the square was bestowed with a new name: aptly, “Place de la Révolution.” It was here that the guillotine would end the reign (and life) of King Louis XVI on 21 January 1793.   7. Tuileries Garden Just east of Place de la Concorde lies the Jardin des Tuileries, once the garden of a royal palace which was opened to the public after the French Revolution. Construction of the Italian Renaissance garden was ordered by Queen Catherine de Medicis in 1564, after the death of her husband, King Henry II. She enlisted the help of Bernard de Carnesse, an architect from Florence. It has seen a number of redesigns over the centuries as ownership of the site was passed on from one ruler to another. View of the Eiffel Tower from one edge of the Tuileries Garden Tuileries Garden Octagonal Basin of the Tuileries Garden Today, the Tuileries Garden is a famous tourist spot and public park. Its centerpiece is an octagonal basin, a realization of landscape architect André Le Nôtre’s vision.   8. The Louvre Walk straight across the garden and you’ll find yourself admiring the Louvre, the world’s most visited art museum, attracting over 9.7 million visitors a year, and also one of the world’s largest, covering an area of over 60,000 square meters. The museum shelters and showcases around 35,000 pieces, the most famous of which is probably the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. The Louvre is open from Wednesday to Monday, 9am-6pm (closed on Tuesdays), but try to visit on a Wednesday or Friday, when the operating hours are extended until 9:45pm, giving you more time to explore more rooms and see more pieces."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2014/09/paris-tourist-attractions-france/,france,"7 Unusual Attractions in Paris Paris is renowned as the City of Love. If you have been there before, you’re certainly familiar with its magnetic appeal. This is why you’ll find yourself traveling there time and again. Next time, however, do not take the same path when touring the city as part of your all inclusive holidays. Take a different path instead and uncover some of the best kept secrets in the City of Light. These are some alternative spots to visit:       WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Hotel de Sens 2. Musee de Carnavalet 3. Par des Buttes Chaumont 4. La Pagode 5. Cimetiere de Montmartre 6. Paris Chinatown 7. Restaurant L’Estaminet Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Hotel de Sens This is amongst the few private homes still standing from the medieval period. It was built in the 14th century. Two centuries later, it became the official residence of Queen Margot; the ex-wife of Henry IV. Its architectural design includes a fortress, which is suggestive of the sieges and battles that took place there. Entrance is free. 2. Musee de Carnavalet This building rivals other famous attractions. This is owing to the fact that it excellently displays Paris’ history through its artifacts and traits. It was a private mansion in the 15th century. It was then obtained by Paris in the 18th century. Expect sheer marvel inside the building as it is home to monuments, paintings and other relics depicting ancient life in the area. 3. Par des Buttes Chaumont This tourist attraction site is proof that big things do come in small packages. Built in the 18th century, the Par des Buttes Chaumont is a tranquil enclave. There is a (man-made) lake, metal bridges and tall stones offering a breathtaking backdrop to the park. Its cozy feel provides a contrast to the fast-paced urban life in Paris. 4. La Pagode This is a movie quarters designed in traditional Japanese fashion. It was actually a gift from a Bon Marche’s manager to his wife. In the 1920s, the building was transformed into a ballroom, but it became a movie theater in the 30s. Although there are many other theaters in the city, this is without a doubt the most distinct. The Japanese garden outside offers delicious traditional tea before screenings. 5. Cimetiere de Montmartre This cemetery is every bit as fascinating as the Pere Lachaise. The air within the vicinity is calm, but solemn at the same time. It’s one of the rare places in Paris that you can go to meditate about life. On the other hand, it’s modest and quite appealing to history lovers. Some notable personalities buried here include: Francois Truffaut and Alexandre Dumas. 6. Paris Chinatown A scene from Paris Je T’aime: Porte de Choisy Located along the Choisy Avenue, this Chinatown is the largest in Europe. It is the neighbourhood of thousands of Chinese (and Vietnamese) inhabitants. The area has more than 100 restaurants, shops and stalls. Despite being an urban dwelling, this Chinatown makes an interesting tourist destination because of its great food and unique populace. 7. Restaurant L’Estaminet It’s a classic cafe that doesn’t try too hard to impress. The Restaurant L’Estaminet is decorated with dark wood, which presents an intimate setting. The little cafe has sumptuous meals and a romantic aura, making it the perfect place for getaway honeymoons. Their rooms (upstairs) are out of this world. The bathroom sinks are built on top of pianos!

The horizon was a giant magnet and we were but paperclips drawn to the edge of the rooftop, watching the clouds bare their silver linings and the sun go for a dive. The honey-colored sky became the perfect backdrop for the mighty Eiffel Tower that rises from a concrete maze. It was a glorious view that begs to be captured, so glorious every single one in the crowd whipped out their smartphones and cameras to take home a piece of the moment. I was in a trance. I have always had an intense fascination with anything French. I tried to learn the French language, obsess with classic French cuisine, and hold Francois Truffaut – my Film god – on a pedestal. There I was, at the top of Tour Montparnasse, living a moment that for the longest time was just a flight of fancy.       It was my first Parisian sunset, my first time in France, my first night outside Asia. And that moment was the first in what felt like an endless succession of firsts over the next seven days. First, first, first. While there is thrill in embracing experiences novel to us and joy in being caught off-guard, Europe’s poster city can also be quite overwhelming. Paris is confident, but she can be intimidating. Beautiful but flawed. Efficient but imperfect. Like many other foreign cities, she can be unforgiving to a lost and confused first-timer. Here are some tips to make your time in Paris as smooth as how you picture it in your dreams. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Don’t try to do it all. 2. Treat time as currency. 3. Know your way around. 4. Go on a side trip outside of the city. 5. Beware of scams. 6. Stay positive. Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Don’t try to do it all. Paris has a lot — and I mean, A LOT — to offer. It has something for everyone and never lets up. Galleries and museums, churches and monuments, chateaus and gardens, restaurants and shops, whatever you’re into, there is no shortage of places to visit and things to do. No rush. One of the pitfalls that first-time visitors usually find themselves in is trying to do it all. Paris is best enjoyed when it doesn’t feel like you’re in the season finale of the Amazing Race. Rushing takes away the fun, especially in a city littered with places that demands more of your time and full attention. If you only have a week or two, try listing down everything — EVERYTHING — you wish to visit and squeeze them into your itinerary, and you’ll soon realize how pointless an exercise it is. For example, the Louvre alone is too vast and rich that it can’t possibly be explored thoroughly in a day. If you want to see all the timeless pieces and historic artifacts it houses, you’re in for a long vacation. But that’s exactly the point: no one is twisting your arm to go through that. Relax. Breathe. Take your time. 2. Treat time as currency. Queue at the Notre Dame Cathedral Many dream of falling in love in Paris, but when they finally set foot in in la ville de l’amour, they usually find themselves falling in line instead. Long queues snake from and around the city’s most popular attractions including the Eiffel Tower and the Notre Dame Cathedral. Seven million visitors ascend the Eiffel Tower each year. But if you’re chasing a breathtaking view of the city, know that you’ll not catch it from the tower. The best views of Paris are those with the tower in it. Don’t burn up a good fraction of your time waiting for your turn. Tour Montparnasse, for example, has relatively tiny queues. Many travelers plan their trips according to budget. But money isn’t the only currency involved when we’re out on the road. Time is just as valuable. Yes, spontaneity is always a good thing, but if you have limited time at your disposal, a little bit of planning can make your trip a thousand times more enjoyable. Choose accommodations in a strategic location even when it weighs a bit heavier in the pocket. There is no point in staying in a cheap hotel in the outskirts of the city when you’ll waste much of your time on the commute and some more dough on the fare. It would also help to know that many restaurants open at noon for lunch, close at from two o’clock, and not back up until seven or eight for dinner. Others are open all day but service during off-peak hours may be slow. Likewise, take note of the sunrise and sunset times to maximize the daylight, especially if you want to spend most of your time outdoors. 3. Know your way around. Lost Getting lost can be fun. It opens doors to interesting adventures and surprising discoveries. But if time is not on your side, it pays to have an idea where you’re going. Being a top tourist destination, Paris is well covered by online maps. All you need is a device with a good connection and you’re good to go. There are also navigation apps available to guide you in your driving, walking, or commuting. Many first-timers are forced to take a cab when they can’t seem to find their way. However, most of the city’s landmarks and attractions are connected by an expansive and reliable train system. Wherever you are, there’s always a station near you. Make use of it. Taking a cab to go anywhere will drain your wallet. 4. Go on a side trip outside of the city. If you’re in search of something different, don’t be afraid to venture out of the metropolis. While Versailles remains the crowd favorite, other towns and cities present equally compelling cases for a detour. Versailles Entrance Mont Saint Michel, an island commune in Normandy, may be three and a half hours away but is absolutely worth the trip. Ask one of the millions who have visited since 1144, when the magnificent abbey that towers over its great halls and houses was built. Also in Normandy is the quaint town of Rouen, an hour and a half north of the city. Brush up on history as you set foot on places where Joan of Arc was held and executed. Provins, a medieval city an hour and a half southeast of Paris, is famous for its underground tunnels and roses. Don’t miss a chance to sip a cup of rose-flavored hot chocolate after a visit to the Watchman’s Tower. 5. Beware of scams. On a separate trip, a friend was distracted by a rowdy group of women in school uniform who boarded the metro. As she was amused by them, little did she know that another was fishing her wallet out of her bag. Another friend was approached by someone asking for a donation. After signing a registration sheet, he realized his phone, which was just on the table seconds ago, was gone. I’d be lying if I said these first-hand stories from people close to me made me feel uneasy about traveling to Paris for the first time, let alone on my own. Paris is a great city, no doubt. But like most great cities, it has its share of people taking advantage of our being new and naïve. Distractions are scattered all over the city. Something beautiful here, something curious there. All it takes, however, is being mindful of your belongings and your surroundings and you should be fine. 6. Stay positive. “No rude waiters? That’s a shock,” said Josephine, a French friend who invited me to dinner on my fourth night in town. After a hearty home-cooked meal, she asked me how many rude waiters I had encountered. The answer was zero. Parisians are notorious for being glum and rude to tourists. Josephine isn’t the only Parisian friend who warned me about it. “It’s the capital of depression,” they say. But to my surprise, locals had been nothing but pleasant to me. Every waiter who served me was friendly. Every bystander I asked for directions was accommodating. Every staff member was happy to help. That’s not to say that it is a fairytale land where unicorns are born. The point is, if you let your preconceived notions take over your attitude toward your trip, you might as well stay at home. Learn a little French. Greet them in their native tongue when you approach them. Be respectful. Show them you appreciate their home. Smile. It’s a beautiful city, and there’s so much to be happy about. Your first time in Paris is only going to be as smooth and joyful as you want it to be. A bit of preparation before the trip can mean dodging a lot of regret during and after. As early as now, decide that it is going to be great, that the city is going to be lovely, and that you are going to have the best time of your life. The thing about first times is, you only get to experiences them once. Make yours one to remember.

Shakespeare’s Globe continues to engage with Henry V, the Phoenix Theatre boasts Blood Brothers and the Shaftesbury has Rock of Ages continually selling out – widely believed to be better than the film brought out this year. The Whispering Gallery You’ve probably heard that the acoustics of some places are spectacular.

Well, you can go one better than that by whispering sweet nothings in your loved one’s ear by standing at either side of this gallery found inside the dome at St Paul’s Cathedral.

Not only is it the quickest and easiest but the cheapest way to get from London to Paris is on the train. You might feel that you’ve got enough trains to deal with in the English capital but why not go and take a look at the Eiffel Tower? Photo by Pao Pena Paris’s Oldest Restaurant We know that you’ve clocked the River Seine and the Eiffel Tower already, but where should you eat? Well, off the beaten track, you can come across Le Procope which was opened back in 1686. This three-storey townhouse has been frequented by many, Benjamin Franklin to name one and now it offers classic dinner service. You need to book but it is one to get in your diary. Tour de Montparnasse You would think that the top of the Eiffel Tower would give you the best view of Paris, but some mavericks believe that this is the place to go. You cannot even see the building itself from the 210-metre summit and the ninth biggest skyscraper in the whole European Union. Frequented by more and more people these days, the exterior isn’t much to look at but from the inside you get to see a 360-degree vista. Notre Dame Cathedral Before you go back, take in arguably the most stunning piece of Gothic architecture in the world with this cathedral. Completed in the 14 th century, some two centuries after it was conceived, this building was the heartbeat of Paris before it was immortalized by Victor Hugo with his tale of “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/09/paris-budget-travel-guide-expenses-sample-itinerary/,france,"PARIS ON A BUDGET: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary Years ago, when major news websites published articles claiming that one can enjoy Paris for less than P60,000, I took it with a grain of salt. But I’ve done it myself, and I can tell you that it is possible. It can be done.       In pop culture, Paris is heavily romanticized as one incredibly beautiful city. In reality, it is exactly that. Even better. On my first day in Paris, the first thing I did was go up to the open-air observatory of Tour Montparnasse to have what many regard as the best view of the city. I remember that moment after emerging from the elevator: I turned right and was immediately greeted by the ever-so-captivating Eiffel Tower. It was the first of the many times the hair at the back of my neck rose for all the good reasons. I’ve been to Paris twice now. And each trip is a realization of a life-long dream. Growing up, I was a fan of French Cinema. At Film school, I worshipped Francois Truffaut. I adore French food. I even learned the French language in college.

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Paris Paris is the political, economic, and cultural capital of France. It has a long history as a settlement, which dates back to 250 BC when a Celtic sub-tribe inhabited the island in the middle of the River Seine called Ile de la Cite. The name of that tribe? Parisii. Or at least, that’s what the Romans called them. The Romans, led by Titus Labienus, conquered them in 52 BC and set up a garrison town named Lutetia. When the Roman Empire crumbled, it fell under the rule of Clovis I, the King of the Franks. Since then, this little garrison town at the bank of the river has grown and flourished into what we call now “Paris,” an important city that has played vital role in the history and politics of Europe, has nurtured many great minds over centuries, and has become a champion for democracy and freedom. Much of the city is inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Parisians’ sophisticated taste and state of mind have also made it the world’s fashion capital and a center for many forms of art. Today, Paris is divided into 20 districts called “arrondissements.” It is important to have at least a basic understanding of it because it will help you make decisions on building your itinerary or choosing accommodations. Know that the center of Paris is called the 1st Arrondissement, and the other districts surrounding it are numbered in a clockwise spiral. This means that 1st arrondissement is surrounded by the 2nd to the 8th, which are surrounded by the 9th to 20th. Here are the arrondissements that you should be familiar with. The 1st to 9th Arrondissements are where most tourist attractions are located. Upscale hotels can also be found here. The 10th to 20th Arrondissements are where you’ll find most major train terminals and cheaper accommodations. There are also some places of interest here that are worth a visit. Artwork by Jpatokal (WikiTravel). Creative Commons Don’t get too overwhelmed. You don’t need to memorize this. But this will help you choose where to stay or plan where to go. The truth is, Paris isn’t that big of a city. You can cross arrondissements on foot in a matter of minutes. You can even walk across the city in just a few hours. Aside from the arrondissements, another way of slicing the Paris pie is using the metro/RER zones. Central Paris is Zones 1-3 and the farther you go from the center, the higher the zone number. Versailles is in Zone 4. CDG Airport is in Zone 5. These zones matter when purchasing metro passes, which I will discuss below. Things to Prepare Before Your Trip Make sure you have the necessary travel documents like the Schengen visa. (If you’re holding a Philippine passport, here’s how to get one successfully .) Here are some other things you might need: Paris Metro Map App . You’ll see a lot of subway maps around but nothing is more efficient than an app. I personally prefer this app because it’s FREE, has a built in map, and has route recommendations. It can detect station nearest you. All you need to do is enter the name of your destination and it will suggest 2 routes: the simplest route (with the fewest train changes), and the fastest route. If you don’t know the name of the station, you can enter the name of the tourist attraction (Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, etc.) and it will display the metro station closest to it. A well-planned itinerary . The worst thing that can happen is spending most of your time on the train because of poor planning. Make sure you visit the attractions close to each other on the same day. A passport-size photo , if you’re going to purchase a NAVIGO Découverte card, which will allow you unlimited metro and RER train rides for a whole week. More about that below. An acceptance that you can’t see and do it all . Paris has a lot to offer. A LOT. You can’t possibly see it all in a week or two. Don’t overload your itinerary and end up seeing so little of everything. Relax, take your time, and enjoy. How to Get to Paris As always, use flight aggregator sites like SkyScanner to check for the lowest fare. Should there be any connecting flights, make sure that the incoming and outgoing flights are using the same airport. If you’re coming from the Manila, I have found that EVA Air, China Eastern, and China Southern offer the cheapest year-round fares with only one stop. Just a bit above P30,000 only. Others offer less but take too many plane changes. You can also find cheaper fares during SEAT SALES. When I was planning my trip, I saw fares for P29,000, but it was gone by the time I was issued a visa. Haha. But it proves that finding fares for less than P30,000 is completely possible. You just need to be patient and book in advance. How to Get to the City Center from the Airport Know that Paris is served by 3 airports: Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Orly (ORY), and Beauvais (BVA). But you’re most likely to be flying in via CDG. CDG has three terminals, with Terminal 3 situated between 1 and 2. (Confusing, I know.) Terminal 2 is divided further into 7 sub-terminals: 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, and 2G. Only Terminals 2 and 3 have train stations. The cheapest and fastest way to get to the city center from the airport is the RER B (blue) train line that makes a stop at both Terminal 2 (between 2F and 2E) and Terminal 3. After going through the Immigration counters, baggage carousel, and customs, just follow the signs that lead to TRAINS TO THE CITY . Also look for the RER sign. If your flight is landing at Terminal 1, here’s how to do it: Take the FREE CDGVAL airport shuttle train to Terminal 3. After going through Immigration, look for the CDGVAL signs, which are all around Terminal 1. Board the shuttle to Terminal 3. At Terminal 3, you will be greeted by a large hall. Walk straight and you will see on your left white-and-fuchsia vending machines. You can buy one-way ticket to the city center for EUR 10. The machine accepts only Euro coins or chip-enabled credit cards. If you don’t have either, find the manned ticket booths to your right. You can buy a ticket here. OR, you can buy a NAVIGO PASS, which I will explain below. NAVIGO WEEK PASS and How to Get One If you’re arriving in Paris on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday by plane, it would be good to purchase a NAVIGO Découverte, a card that will allow you unlimited rides to the metro, RER trains, trams, and buses for a week. It’s a good buy because, as I said earlier, the fare from the airport to the city center alone is EUR 10. Round trip is EU 20. But a NAVIGO Découverte costs only EU 22.15 plus another EUR 5 for the actual card. Total of EUR 27.15. It already covers all 5 tourism zones of Paris. Another case that proves Navigo Découverte as a wise choice is when you’re traveling to Versailles. The trip to Versailles alone costs EUR 7.10. But Versailles is in Zone 4, and is covered by Navigo. You won’t have to purchase another ticket to get there. Same applies to Disneyland Paris, which is in Zone 5. But there’s a catch. Timing is everything when it comes to Navigo. Each card is valid only from Monday 00:00 (12 mn) to Sunday 23:59 (11:59 pm). It doesn’t take into consideration what day you first use it. So for example, you purchase it on a Wednesday, that gives you only 4 days to use the card. You will have to reload it on Monday if you still want to continue using it. That’s the reason why they stop selling Navigo Découverte passes for the week on Thursday 23:59. If you buy on a Friday, that pass will be valid for the coming Monday, not that same week. To purchase a Navigo Découverte card, here’s what you need to do: Approach a ticket window at any Metro or RER train station. Tell the staff that you’re buying a NAVIGO Découverte card for ALL 5 ZONES. They will ask you for a photo (300mm x 250mm). Sometimes they accept passport-size photo. If you don’t have a photo, there are Photomaton booths at almost every station in Paris. The staff will then assemble the card for you and explain how it works. Pay for it. EUR 5 for the card, and EUR 22.15 for the load. That’s it. You can use it right away. Just hover the card above the scanner when entering any station. A NAVIGO Monthly Pass is also available for EUR 73. Where to Stay Cheap in Paris As with many other cities around the world, the closer you are to the Paris city center the more expensive accommodations get. Even the properties listed on AirBnB can be pricey, depending on the location. In Paris, there’s a high concentration of budget hotels and hostels in the areas near Montmartre (18th and 12th arrondissements), Place d’Italie (13th Arrondissement), and Voltaire area (11th Arrondissement). I have tried staying in Place d’Italie and Voltaire area, and I liked the latter because it is much closer to the city center and has a great vibe. Check Rates Here How to Get Around Paris The best way to see Paris: ON FOOT. Paris is a very walkable city because it isn’t that big and there’s a lot of interesting things to see. Roadside cafes lace almost every corner, historic monuments adorn its roundabouts, and the smell of freshly baked bread coming from local boulangeries fill the air. Walking is really the way to go. The Louvre Many tourist attractions can be visited in a day just by walking. For example, the Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees, Place de la Concorde, Jardin de Tuileries, and the Louvre are situated next to each other. You can spend one full day checking all these out. (Actually, you can spend one full day inside the Louvre and it still won’t be enough.) However, if you’re too exhausted to walk, the best alternative is the subway or the METRO. One thing I totally love about Paris is its expansive 300-station train system that connects much of the city. It’s cheap and efficient, and it’s seldom crowded because there’s always a train every five minutes or so. Things to Do and Places to Visit Too many to mention. Haha. Kidding. But seriously, there’s so much to experience in the City of Light. But below are some things that I think one shouldn’t miss when they’re in Paris, grouped according to proximity to one another so you can easily see them on foot.

If you’re coming from the airport or visiting Versailles or Disneyland Paris, this is a good deal. (I already explained above.) Museum Pass . Get the museum pass if you plan on visiting at least 3 museums. The cost of the pass: EUR 48 for 2 days or EUR 62 for 4 days. It’s a bargain considering the individual entrance fees, which are listed below. But if you’re not a big museum junkie and you’re only interested in Versailles and the Louvre, skip this.

For example, as mentioned above, access to the Louvre is FREE on the first Sunday of every month from October to March. But expect to see bigger crowds here. Just check the museum you intend to visit. Food . A meal at a cheap restaurant plays within the EUR 10-12 range. Drinks not yet included. At mid-scale restaurants, you’ll find set meals for EUR 16-22. The best way to save on food is to buy from the grocery, supermarket, or cheap food stalls and just eat it in your hotel. Some rooms are equipped with a microwave, so you can heat your food. For example, we stumbled upon a store selling a WHOLE CHICKEN for only EUR 5. At Marks and Spencer, we found a 5-piece barbeque chicken for EUR 3.5. Eat out for lunch . Should you wish to eat out and experience some of Paris’s restaurants, do so for lunch, not for dinner. Lunch is much cheaper. Ask for tap water . Tap water in Paris is perfectly safe to drink. At a restaurant, ask for “un verre d’eau” which means “a glass of water.” When you’re asked if you want flat or sparkling, just say you want tap water. Tip right . Tipping isn’t obligatory in Paris. You don’t need to tip. But if you really want to tip, 5% is safe. If you had exceptional service, 10% should suffice. Walk . Again, walk if you can. This isn’t a budget tip, but splurge sometimes. Treat yourself sometimes. Allow yourself to enjoy some things even when it costs more. Have a taste of escargot. Order red wine. Things to Watch Out For Pickpockets are everywhere in Paris especially in touristy areas, so make sure you always keep an eye on your valuables. But you should also be cautious of scams. Here are some of them. Petition Scam . You might encounter them as soon as you emerge from the airport. Their M.O. is this: someone, often pretending to be deaf, approaches you and asks you to sign a petition. While you’re busy signing, someone else is busy stealing your wallet or phone. The trick is, the petition is usually on a clipboard which blocks your view of the item they want to steal. Sometimes, they don’t pick pockets but they force tourists into paying them money by revealing that the petition is actually a donation pledge. The String Bracelet Scam . Most common at the staircase leading to the Sacré-Coeur Basilica in Montmartre, but they can also be found in other touristy places. Their goal is to wrap a string bracelet around your wrist and force you to pay an excessive amount for it. How they get to tie that string varies. Sometimes, they tell you it’s for free or that it’s a gift. Sometimes, they just ask for a high-five. Most of the time, they tell you they’re gonna show you a magic trick. The Gambling Game Scam . You’ll see many of them at the park behind the Eiffel Tower and the street that connects it to the Trocadero Viewing Deck. The MO is for you to bet on one of three cups that you think contains the pea or ball, but they are really just gonna squeeze money out of you. Sometimes, they will let you win at first to get you to bet bigger next time. You may also see another tourist win big, but he’s an accomplice. The Did-You-Drop-This Scam . A woman will get your attention and ask you if you dropped something, usually a ring. If you say no, she’ll tell you to keep it for good luck. And then she asks for money. Sample 6D Paris Itinerary If you only have 6 days to give to Paris, here’s a sample itinerary. DAY 1 – ARRIVAL, TOUR MONTPARNASSE 13:30 – Arrival in Paris, go through Immigration14:30 – Buy Museum Pass at airport, NAVIGO pass, board train to city center16:00 – Check in at Au Royal Mad, rest a little18:00 – Go to Tour Montparnasse and watch sunset20:30 – Have dinner at one of the creperies nearby22:00 – Back in the hotel DAY 2 – CHAMPS-ELYSEES + THE LOUVRE (Ideally Wed or Fri) 08:00 – Wake up + Breakfast09:30 – Arc de Triomphe (you can go up if you want)11:30 – Walk down Champs-Elysees, Place de la Concorde13:00 – Lunch14:00 – The Louvre20:00 – Dinner, back to hotel DAY 3 – VERSAILLES 08:00 – Wake up + Breakfast09:00 – Go to Versailles10:00 – Start tour13:00 – Lunch14:00 – Continue touring19:00 – Dinner DAY 4 – LE MARAIS, NOTRE DAME, LATIN QUARTER 10:00 – Walk around Le Marais area11:00 – Eat falafel at L’As du Fallafels12:30 –Notre Dame Cathedral and surrounding areas15:00 – Latin Quarter, late lunch19:00 – Trocadero + Eiffel Tower DAY 5 – MONTMARTRE DAY 6 – DEPARTURE Breakdown of Expenses Here’s the breakdown of expenses if you follow the itinerary above. Note that this assumes you are a party of 2 and you will be staying in a budget hotel in Paris in September-November. For this itinerary, I’m choosing a double room (shared bathroom) at Au Royal Mad in the Voltaire area. It’s a no-frills hotel but clean and decent enough and in a great location. This also assumes that you’re limiting your food expenses to only EUR 12 a meal on the average. Average! So if you splurge on a meal at lunch, you can compensate by buying EUR3.5 chicken drumsticks at a grocery store for dinner. But please do not starve yourself. Spend more if you want, when you can. PRE-TRIP EUR 60 – Visa feeEUR 26 – Visa service feeEUR 28 – Blue Cross Prestige Euro Insurance DURING THE TRIP EUR 27.15 – Navigo Week PassEUR 142.5 – Hotel Stay for 5 nights (EUR 57/night, divided by 2 pax)EUR 15 – Louvre ticketEUR 18 – VersaillesEUR 15 – Tour MontparnasseEUR 180 – Total Food Expenses GRAND TOTAL: EUR 511.65 (USD 574) That’s PHP 27,668. If you’re able to snag a roundtrip ticket for P30,000, that places the total cost at PHP 57,668 . Also, if you’re a solo traveler, staying at a dorm room will significantly reduce the cost. There are a lot of hostels in Paris offering dorm beds. The figures and itinerary above are basic and visit mostly FREE attractions. Of course, feel free to spend more on things you want to experience if you can afford it. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2014/11/best-view-eiffel-tower-montparnasse-tour-paris/,france,"The Best View of the Eiffel Tower: Tour Montparnasse, Paris It wasn’t just my first night in Paris. It was my first night outside Asia. And I swore to celebrate it with the best view of the French capital. A quick consultation with my best friend, Google, gave me a few suggestions: the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur, the rooftop of Centre Pompidou, and the top of the Eiffel Tower itself. The most compelling was Tour Montparnasse 56, “the city’s one and only skyscraper.” The best view of Paris, the reviews promised. (If you’re coming from the UK, you can fly to Paris via Flybe . They also have code-share agreements with Air France and KLM.)       After an afternoon of leaving footprints along Champs-Élysées, off to Montparnasse I went. A quick walk led me to the base of the 689-foot giant. The tower itself looked rather modern, terribly out of place amid structures that appeared they had stood there for centuries. A personnel at the door ushered me to its fastest elevator, the one that ferries passengers straight to the 56th floor. In only 38 seconds, I reached the viewing deck. There were not many tourists, a stark contrast to the long lines at the Eiffel. I was there too early. I had planned on catching the Parisian sunset here so I ensured I would be here at around six in the evening. I forgot one thing: In this part of the world at this time of the year, the sun doesn’t set until around 8:30pm. I had more than two hours to spare. Waiting is not a problem at Tour Montparnasse. The viewing deck boasts an unobstructed 360-degree view of the city. There is no shortage of spectacular scenery. To the south sprawls the Montparnasse Cemetery, and to the west stand the Eiffel Tower, the Church of Saint-Sulpice, and the Cathedrale Saint-Louis des Invalides. Binoculars offer a closer look, and the indoor cafe provide refreshments to exhausted visitors (for a fee, of course). Binoculars are available for those who covet a closer look. View of Montparnasse Cemetery from the tower Cathedrale Saint-Louis des Invalides Church of Saint-Sulpice When the sun began teasing to dive, I scurried to the stairs to access the outdoor roof deck where only a few tourists lingered. I found a spot and witnessed the heavenly show. Clouds bared their darker linings as the light began to dwindle. The sun, finally taking some rest, became a perfect backdrop to the mighty Eiffel Tower. It was a glorious picture, so glorious it commanded the already thick crowd to whip out their phones and cameras and capture #ThatWonderfulMoment. But the lights coming from the gadgets were no match to what happened next. When the evening welcomed its first top of the hour, the Eiffel Tower showed off some shimmer, forcing the admiring souls beside me to endure raising their phones a little bit longer. Much like the sunset just minutes before, the light show was a fleeting experience, something you have to take in in a matter of minutes. View of the sunset from the Montparnasse 56 The Eiffel Tower at sunset and nightfall. Tourists watching the sunset. Capture #ThatWonderfulMoment! Eiffel Tower at Night Those who failed to grab the first run folded themselves on the floor, still facing Europe’s most famous landmark. The sparks would be back again after an hour; they waited. Friends made a toast, and lovers shared a kiss — almost everyone had a glass of champagne in one hand. The frugal and eager halves of me wrestled, but austerity won in the end with just one look at what was inside my wallet. Next time, maybe.

"https://hippie-inheels.com/cheap-flight-to-paris-next-vacay/,france,"There’s a Million Reasons to go to Paris, But This Round Trip Flight For Just $377 is the Best One! There’s something about Paris. When I first went to Europe, there was no other place I was more excited about going to than Paris. It’s got a dreamy quality about it, but it’s not just a Hollywood manipulation – f rom misty gray mornings following your nose as you track down the best croissant to strolling the aisles at Port St Ouen looking for vintage finds, Paris has a “certain something” that can’t be missed.  There are a million reasons to travel to Paris, but did you know that you can get a round-trip flight from within the USA to Paris for just $375? This is cheaper than when I just flew to Florida from Ohio! The trip of a lifetime to Paris isn’t out of reach. This vintage postcard was bought for €1 at Port St Ouen, a vintage shopper’s heaven in the North of  Paris . The flea market here is said to be one of the largest of its kind in the world. One of the best views of the Eiffel Tower is from the top of Tour Montparnasse – 210 meters up! Cheap Flights to Paris With Next Vacay I think people have it in their heads that it would cost thousands at a minimum to go to Europe for a week, but it really doesn’t have to be that way if you are proactive about planning for your trip. I use Next Vacay to be on the look out for the crazy low price deals they email to me a few times a week. They emailed this deal of $375 to Paris and I just had to share this with you because I feel like it’s SO much more affordable to travel to places like Paris than people realize. I love that Next Vacay makes these deals known which makes dream destinations more accessible for us to travel. (I actually listed them in my favorite 9 websites I use to plan my trips  and wrote a full review you can read here .) Once you’ve got your flight, the next step in planning a trip is to find a hotel. I always tell people to research a bit first to see what area/neighborhood you want to be in rather than finding out later the amazing deal you found means you have to take a taxi 30 minutes into town each day. If you can find hotels in neighborhoods of Marais or St. Germain, you’ll love these areas with cool boutiques and shops selling baguettes on every corner. While you might think it’s great to be near the Eiffel Tower or Champs-Elysées, I don’t actually recommend these areas unless you’re rolling in the dough. Because you are saving so much on a flight if you use deals like this from Next Vacay, it means you’ve got a little extra to use to get a nice boutique hotel or get a cheap hotel and use it to macaroons and nice wine. This is an apartment in Le Marais with a little Parisian picnic using ingredients and wine from a local French supermarket! But if you don’t want to splurge, just skip the fancy apartment or hotel and have the picnic down along the Seine overlooked Notre Dame Cathedral If you want to cut costs even more, there are a lot of free things to do in Paris like the Parc de la Villette open air cinema, Jardin Du Luxembourg, and of course the  Notre Dame Cathedral. There are so many places to see in Paris, but definitely, make time to get this view which I find totally magical: Throughout  Paris , you’ll find dozens of carousels, all cute, and most definitely ‘Instagrammable’. This photo was taken at the very base of the Eiffel Tower, though there is another carousel just a few hundred meters away, at the base of Trocadéro.  The light around Trocadéro is best in the early morning- head there then to get plenty of photos with amazing light and few people! The best things in Paris are taking long walks, taking in the views, and of course boozy brunches. Are you dying to visit!? Just writing this makes me want to head straight back to Paris! Now,   I’ve talked to a lot of my readers about the best ways to make their travel dreams a reality, especially traveling to Paris. When we talk about the details of their trips – walking down the Seine at sunset, or visiting the Eiffel Tower for the first time – their eyes light up with possibility and wonder. I absolutely love seeing how excited they get! But way too often that excitement fades. That’s because they start thinking about all the reasons they can’t “just go” to Paris. And I totally get it. When I started traveling, purchasing a quick flight to Paris was something other people did. Not me! How could I possibly just take off and go travel to Paris? It felt selfish. It even felt unfair. Like, “Who am I to just take off and enjoy a week in Paris?” Then one day I asked myself “Why not? What’s stopping me?” And that’s when I realized I had all of these reasons for saying no, without thinking of all of the reasons to say yes! The experience, the excitement, the culture, the beauty. I’d always dreamed of this trip, why shouldn’t I take it? Of course I deserve this! A part of me wanted to believe everything would fall apart if I took time off for myself- but in reality, I knew things would be fine. Yes, we’re all busy and it can be hard to make time for ourselves and our dreams. Going to Paris wasn’t just about having a luxurious vacation–it was me saying yes to myself, and my life. And all I needed to do to make it a reality was take one tiny step, which for me was signing up for Next Vacay –which has literally changed my life. These cheap flight deals are really a game changer. So, Wait – What is Next Vacay? I have been using Next Vacay for over a year. I reviewed them and it went viral – people started emailing me telling me the amazing deals there were getting from Next Vacay. I am so excited to see people getting to travel places they never thought they could! There are not many companies that I promote, and Next Vacay is something that I believed in back when they were a brand new company and I am so happy to see how huge they have become – being on the live news, TIME.com, and so much more. Let me sum up how Next Vacay works in case you don’t want to read my past review: You pay $25 for the whole year, input your local airport and a couple nearby ones, then they start emailing your deals that make sense for you (prices in the email are always round-trip). Then you use the deals to book directly through the airline they found the deal, not through Next Vacay. Basically, Next Vacay are just the deal hunters telling you when a crazy cheap flight is available from your hometown airport to well, anywhere in the world like Paris, Sydney, London, The Maldives, Hanoi, and New Zealand. They don’t send a deal out unless it’s a true “steal”. It’s a husband and wife team, and you’ll right away notice how personable the emails are. Naveen &amp; Shaylee Dittakavi, the husband and wife founders and deal hunters of nextvacay.com, sending deals out to members while waiting to board a flight The fact that it’s $25 now and was $25 a year ago means a lot – they aren’t trying to raise their prices. $25 is so cheap to pay for a year of deals, that I’m surprised they haven’t! You can do a free month trial, and you can cancel if you don’t find a deal in six months that you like with a money back guarantee – so there’s literally no downside. They will email you before year two starts to see if you want to go ahead or cancel the subscription (before your card is charged). What caught my eye with this website over a year ago, was when Naveen, the owner posted to Facebook he was on a roundtrip flight USA-India for just $300. I was like, wow, I NEED these deals in my life. I haven’t been disappointed with at least 2 deals coming to my inbox each day to amazing places like Madrid for $450, Dublin for $400, Puerto Vallarta for $500 and Mumbai for $825 (with Columbus, Ohio as my home airport). You can also check out Next Vacay’s Facebook page  where they share deals that their users got (which the users themselves posted to Facebook). It’s amazing to see people so excited about their upcoming trip. Just by paying $25, you get the best deals ever sent to your inbox which honestly opens up your life to so much – because travel is just “step one”. Once you get there, you will have life-changing experiences, meet friends, maybe meet a significant other like I did , or you might even find a new career from travel! It will open so many doors. I wouldn’t be promoting something I don’t believe in, and I really feel like for $25 this is a no-brainer. The best part is they find deals over holidays and long weekends, too, when you can actually take the time to travel. Where do you want to travel? Paris, somewhere else? Start now! You can sign up for your free trial and start actually living out your wanderlust dreams at a fraction of the cost."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-st-tropez/,france,"What makes St. Tropez  a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Saint Tropez is the epitome of luxury travel and perfect for those seeking a luxury lifestyle. There is such a positive energy about the town and that’s what I love about it most. Saint Tropez has numerous fine hotels, villas and restaurants to keep the most discerning traveller happy. What 5-star hotel is the best in St. Tropez ? For me the Pan Dei Palace is the best 5* Hotel in Saint Tropez. Hotel Byblos is more well known, but I prefer the Pan Dei’s understated class over the more in your face Byblos . Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in Saint Tropez , of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? We have been returning to Hotel La Garbine for many years. Located just a short walk from the famous Tahiti Beach, La Garbine is a small family run hotel with a good sized pool and well-appointed rooms. Your host, Christian makes you feel like one of the family and provides a relaxed atmosphere in which guests can really unwind. Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Saint Tropez? If your pockets are deep enough, you could hire a yacht for the day and motor round to the Pampelonne beach and lunch at Club 55 , former hangout of Bridgette Bardot no less. Alternatively, you could take the short drive up to the beautiful, medieval village of Grimaud up in the hills overlooking Saint Tropez bay and take a spot of lunch in the Cafe de France . Where are the best hang outs during the day in Saint Tropez? During the day, everybody heads to the beach, with the Pampelonne being the most popular. Our favourite restaurant for lunch is Tabou Beach , located on Tahiti Beach. The satay prawns are to die for and you can chill with a nice glass of Domaine Ott Rose taking in the views and listening to some chilled house music. After lunch, you can pick up the pace a little and head to Nikki Beach where the party really gets going… If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in [insert city] and what are their best dishes? My favourite fine dining experience in Saint Tropez can be found at L’Escale , located in the Port of Saint Tropez. L’Escale is the perfect place to sit down and watch the super yachts roll in whilst you tuck into a Plats De Fruits De Mer, followed by grilled Fillet de Saint-Pierre (John Dorey) and wash it all down with a glass or 3 of Laurent Perrier Rose Champagne. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? You will struggle to find a bad meal in Saint Tropez and most of the restaurants serve up a mean Creme Brûlée or Moelleux au Chocolat, but I would recommend those with a sweet tooth head to a Tarte Tropizienne patisserie for a cake of the same name. The cream filled brioche will leave you in a sugar filled trance of ecstasy. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Saint Tropez ; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Where do I start? Chanel, Cavalli, Gucci, Hermes, Villbrequin, Breitling…you won’t have a problem finding luxury designers in Saint Tropez, the issue may be the balance on your Amex at the end of it! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in St. Tropez ? The Pan Dei has its own onsite wellness centre, and guests can enjoy a massage in their room, onsite or best of all on the Pan Dei’s very own 100-foot yacht in Saint Tropez port. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? I always enjoy a sunset cocktail at the Senequier in Saint Tropez port as I settle down for a good old spot of people watching in the circus that is Saint Tropez marina at sundown. For those looking for a romantic spot, Grimaud village has stunning views across Saint Tropez bay. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. We always head to White 1921 champagne cocktail bar to get our pre-dinner game on. They serve up a pretty mean (and large!) champagne Mojito, guaranteed to get you in the mood and as good as any we had in Buenos Aires recently. If you end the night at a fancy club in St. Tropez , which one do you head towards? Many would say Caves du Roy in the Byblos hotel, but I would avoid that trap. The club is hard to get into and seriously expensive once you do get in. The VIP rooms are another option where, if you are lucky, you may get to see a performance by Snoop Dog or Carl Cox. The easier and arguably more fun option is Papagayo , located in the marina, where I have partied many a time until 3am with my wife Gemma and several grey goose, soda, limes!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-cannes/,france,"What makes Cannes a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Former Lord Chancellor Lord Brougham set out to visit Nice in 1834, but he was stuck in a small fishing village called Cannes, because of a cholera outbreak in Nice. After this winter, he spent the next 30 winters in Cannes and he became the first person to spread the words to the European aristocrats to come and visit the place. By the beginning of the 20 th century Cannes had become one of the most glamorous cities of Europe.  The World’s oldest and most prestigious film festival takes place in this beautiful coastal town every May for the last 68 years. During the 10 days of the festival, Cannes becomes a melting pot of celebrities, billionaires and wannabes.

Also, the champagne reception of the 20 th anniversary Pulp Fiction screening took place here with Tarantino and Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Another hot spot during the day is the Carlton Beach. Get yourself a sun lounger and you can watch all the photo calls here during the festival. Borat’s mankini was first launched here.

Nice is definitely one of the most glamorous places to visit amongst the other beautiful cities along the coast of the South Of France, Monte Carlo, Cannes, Antibes and St. Tropez are a must visit on this trip. I would recommend making Nice the base of the vacation with its ultra chic vacationers, and gorgeous hotels to stay at, not to mention the absolutely breathtaking ocean. Although they have pebble beaches once you turn on your music lay back take a dip in the pristine water and soak up the sun you’ve long forgotten about the pebbly terrain. I have to mention the absolutely fabulous food and restaurants in the city, at the top of the list is the two Michelin starred restaurant Le Chantecler at the famous Hotel Negresco. Located right on the famous Promenade des Anglais overlooking the breathtaking ocean, it’s an absolute gastronomical delight! The beauty of Nice however doesn’t quite only lie in visiting high-end restaurant or strutting the high-end shopping streets, there’s a plethora of cute and delectable restaurants throughout the city, one such gem is a classic French restaurant, Bistrot d’Antoine in the Old town Nice. It’s extremely popular amongst the locals and why wouldn’t it be with its delicious Mediterranean cuisine and reasonable prices.  What 5 star hotel is the best in Nice? Located right on the famous Bay of angles Hotel Negresco would definitely be my pick for when you are in Nice. The hotel boasts some of the most spectacular views of the city and each room has been tastefully designed by the owners themselves who are self-confessed art connoisseur. As a family owned hotel for more than 50 years, the striking white and pink building complete with its gorgeous domed tower is a National historic Monument. You can be rest assured that your breakfast views from the gorgeous balconies overlooking the sparkling Mediterranean sea will leave you breathless and what better way to start your day! The service is exceptional as expected and for art lovers it’s an absolute treat.

There are so many gorgeous little boutique hotels to choose from in Nice, mostly to fit in any budget. People have this misconception that the south of France is extremely expensive and overpriced but honesty barring Monte Carlo and perhaps Cannes during the film festival in May, my sister and I ended up spending so much time at the beach that we didn’t overshoot our budgets at all   (not that we had one in mind). Some of the places to stay that I would personally recommend would be Hyatt Regency Nice Palais de la Méditerranée : gorgeous views and the if you can get yourselves to book the Sea Side Suite with its insane sea view and floor-to-ceiling windows that open up to your private terrace, marble bathrooms –basically you get my drift – THE WORKS! For something perhaps a little bit more pocket friendly NH Nice and Hotel la villa Nice Promenade are great options as well ! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Nice? Nice has heaps of options for the adventurous traveler, I would be kidding myself and my readers if I said I was conventionally adventurous, but one can be adventurous in different ways right? My sister and I hired bicycles for our time in Nice and did a lot of cycling in and around the city, went up to the famous Castle hill, rode across the beach, went towards the outskirts of the city and found it super fun and a great way to burn those extra calories we were adding up eating all the delicious food. Besides this, one can parasail, snorkel, paddle board, go out and dive and I am pretty sure there are areas around the south of France to sky dive and bungee jump.   A few travelers we spoke to during our breakfast at the hotel were on their way to sky dive one morning! Where are the best hang outs during the day in Nice? I’m an absolute sucker for a day at the beach, so if I’m a in a city where there’s an ocean then that’s where you’re gonna find me. People often complain about the pebble beach in Nice and although being very bias to Australian beaches and soft sand, the water is so immensely stunning and the temperatures and tides just perfect for a lazy swim and hours of sunbathing! You can choose between the public beach or the private beach, sometimes if you eat lunch at one the restaurants on the beach, the allow you sit on the private beach. We did both and both were equally fun. If you’re looking for something more stimulating you could always stroll around the many alleys of this enchanting city, some parts of it aren’t as modern and   have been preserved, as a symbol of “Old Nice”, when you head inland from the sea front you start to notice these row of   low cottages (Ponchettes), some renovated partly that have been converted into quaint cafes and gorgeous art galleries. You can also browse around one of the most famous markets in France which is normally set up behind these cottages. images via flickr:  Luca Nebuloni People watching is one of my favourite ways to pass time in a new city, grab a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and just soak in sights and sounds of a different culture, understand what makes its heart beat: children playing in a park, couples falling in love some arguing their ways in and out of a situation haha….its a wonderful thing to be able to absorb things raw and untouched. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Nice and what are their best dishes? People have this misconception of Nice being a very expensive holiday destination, and as a regular traveler I can assure you, it could be and it doesn’t HAVE to be. You can make it work just wonderfully within your budget-high, low or medium! So yes, there are a ton of restaurants, some even Michelin star, that could be a perfect date night dinner serving up exotic French delicacies but you could also grab a picnic basket, chose a spot in one of the many beautiful parks and have a lovely night under the stars enjoying local favorites such as “SOCCA” local crepes made from chickpea flour with a million toppings to choose from. Ratatouille is another specialty of the region and available at many restaurants, With Italy being such a close neighbors it’s not surprising that pastas and pizzas find itself on many menus in restaurants in nice and they DO NOT disappoint! Let’s talk desserts in Nice- what place makes the best? I can’t really say what’s the BEST place and the BEST dessert. I have an extremely sweet tooth (I am gorging on chocolate as I’m writing this blog) so yeah…my recommendation would be to walk down the street Rue de France and discover all the little desserts offered by different patisseries and boulangeries. The displays are so colorful tempting and very promising. Definitely eat some Macaroons, try the chocolate and almond stuffed croissant, I will mention the crepes again, my favourites are the strawberry with butter lemon and sugar but there are lots to try from and honestly I don’t remember where I ate them because every place was really really good! At restaurants, I usually order a crème brulee, and try not eating too heavy a main haha! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Nice? I’m not sure why, being a designer and a stylist, shopping wasn’t at the top of my list when I first arrived in nice, it never actually is once I see the ocean BUT we did shop towards the end of our trip. Nice is a lovely place to shop both high-end designer stuff, local trendy boutiques and markets and the regular high street brands. Its got everything! A good place to start would be the old town and the markets that we spoke about earlier for little collectibles, souvenirs and jewellery. To find regular stores, like Zara, Bershka , Pimki you should head straight to avenue Medecin which runs the north-south length of the modern city centre. The famous French department store Galeries Lafayette is definitely worth a browse. I always try to buy something local from the place I am in, a painting, a hand-made souvenir or a local brand. I did find very interesting stuff at the local evening markets that get set up in the summer and remember buying a gorgeous leather bracelet/band. Time for a great sunset view in Nice… where would you go? Negresco would be a great place to go for a sunset view I would   imagine and it is highly recommended, but we took this little train that runs from the end of Promenade des Anglais costs approx 10 euros and takes you through the flower market, the Maseena Square and the Castle hill and a couple of other spots, it stops for ten mins at the Castle and that’s pretty much where our ride ended since we were so mesmerized by the views, the sunset and the beauty of that place that we had long forgotten how we got there haha! It was a wonderful walk/trek down the hill but I think we saw more that way. Jean-Pierre Dalbéra  via Flickr Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Bar De Oiseaux is a great little spot in the old town, although it may be a little difficult to find it has great live jazz music, sometimes a comedy act amongst other entertainers, named for the birds that inhabit the area for 5 bucks on entertainment nights it’s a great little spot to start the night and mingle with some locals in a relaxed atmosphere! Often people gather around promenade des anglais for live music events that take place over the summer months and make for a fun and entertaining way to start a night If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Voulez vous danser avec moi? Haha I had to throw in a bit of my French here, well there are plenty a fancy clubs to choose from and although I am not a party/clubbing person I do have a few recommendations for those who would like to go ! Le Trois Diables which translates to the three devils has been a popular spot with locals and tourists for years, happy hours run from 5pm -9pm. Another one that’s popular is Le Ghost: comfortable and interesting interiors create an excellent atmosphere for the skilled in-house DJ’s, who play at this small speakeasy kinda vibe club, great energy and great music cover up for a small dance floor ;) if you’re looking for something fancy and classy, to mingle with the high-end nice locals , L’ambassade is probably the best place to go and splurge!"https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,france,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,france,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://hippie-inheels.com/should-not-miss-country-of-georgia/,georgia_europe,"7 Places to Visit in Georgia Europe That You Don’t Want to Miss The Eastern European country of Georgia has so far been spared from the plague of mass tourism, and group tours have yet to discover the beauty and diversity of the Caucasian nation nestled in between Russia, Turkey , Azerbaijan, and Armenia . Yet, there are many places to visit in Georgia Europe (or “Euraisa”) that you might not know about. Aerial view of Tbilisi Places to Visit in Georgia Europe It is instead, a perfect destination for more intrepid travelers wanting to explore mountainous regions and lush lowland vineyards. Hiring a 4×4 vehicle is the best way to get around and visit all the best places, such as remote villages and hidden valleys. Here are some some our favorite places to visit in Georgia Europe (not USA)! 1. Tbilisi Although we are not normally fans of large cities, spending a few days in Georgia’s quirky capital is a must. Unlike other capital cities, it is rather compact and the best sights can be visited easily on foot. Tbilisi is home to the cutest crooked clock tower we’ve ever seen! Don’t you agree?   Crooked clock tower in Tbilisi One of our favourite experiences in the country of Georgia was bathing in the Sulphur baths located in the Abanotubani area of the capital. You can read all about it here . 2. Uplistsikhe The ancient cave town of Uplistsike, built up on a hillside, is a lot of fun to explore, making it a unique destination which should not be missed. Some of the caves have brilliantly carved interiors, whilst others are more simple. The cave town of Uplistsike The town was used as a rest stop for merchants on the Silk Road and there’s even an escape tunnel hacked in the rock which enabled the inhabitants to leave in case of attack. It is not far from Tbilisi and can easily be incorporated as part of an interesting day trip from the capital including Uplistsikhe, Mtskheta and Gori. Some of the caves have carved interiors, whilst others are more simple 3. Mtskheta The draw here is Jvari Monastery which provides great views all over town. The town itself just below the monastery is also very pretty and you can easily walk all around it stopping for some pomegranate juice and khinkali at one of the many stalls. View of Mtskheta from Jvari Monastery  4.  Svaneti Home to the fierce Svan people, the region is best known for its tall defence towers scattered around the region, which in ancient times, used to provide an important lookout in case of attack by other tribes. We did not find the people in Mestia (the main town in the region) fierce at all – on the contrary they did their utmost to help us repair our 4×4 after it broke down on a Sunday, even going so far as to wake up the local mechanic at 7am! Ushguli, a fairytale village in Svaneti The area is home to Ushguli, a small community bearing the title of the highest inhabited village in Europe. The route from Mestia to Ushguli is dangerous and should only be undertaken by very experienced drivers in a 4×4 who are capable of keeping their cool when faced with the steep muddy cliffside trails leading to the village – Nikki did a great job here, although our vehicle broke down right after we got back! The almost-unreal scenery around Ushguli is spectacular giving a fairytale aura to the village. It is probably the prettiest and most underrated village that we have ever traveled to! The surreal landscape of the Ushguli region 5. Katskhi Pillar Why is a church dramatically perched atop a 40-metre tall narrow karst column you may ask? No one is certain as to why it was built there in the first place, but if like us, you enjoy visiting bizarre-looking and mysterious destinations, you are almost certainly going to want to drive all the way to the town of Chiatura to look for the pillar. The church at the top is actually a complex also housing three hermit cells and a wine cellar and has been home to a monk for the past 20 years. Unfortunately, women are not allowed to climb to the top. The church built atop the Katskhi Pillar 6. Stepandsminda (Kazbegi) We spent most of our time in this mountain village warming ourselves up with coffee (and wine) and eating cheesy Khachapuri in the shadow the giant Kazbek mountain. Stepandsminda is home to the Gergeti Trinity Church, perhaps the most iconic landmark in Georgia, so be sure to make your way up the rough mountain trail to experience the mountain views from this point. The Gergeti Trinity Church in the shadow of Mount Kazbegi The backdrop to the church is truly spectacular, and we spent ages walking around the church in circles trying to take the best picture possible from different spots! The area is home to some great mountain trekking opportunities too! On our way to Stepandsminda from Tbilisi, we stopped at the beautiful Ananuri Fortress and climbed up to the top of the tower to take in the wonderful views over the Aragvi River . The beautiful Ananuri Fortress 7. Khaketi Did you know that Georgia is considered to be the birthplace of wine? More so, the Kakheti region is where the tradition originated, some 8,000 or so years ago. Kakheti is still considered to be Georgia’s best wine region, growing almost 75% of the country’s wine grapes – an alluring part of the country in which hundreds of vineyards surround the cute, rural villages which dot the valleys and hills. Most individual villages here are known for a particular type of wine they produce and almost every household makes its own. Kakheti is still considered to be Georgia’s best wine region It was not surprising that we were greeted with a huge jug of wine and a platter of fruit as soon as we arrived to the guesthouse we were staying at in the fortified medieval village of Sighnaghi. The fortified walls in the medieval village of Sighnaghi Sighnaghi proved to be a great base for our travels in the area. We drove around the lush hills, stopping at wineries to sample the country’s best vino by day. By night, we walked the cobblestoned roads of the hillside town in search of some Shkmeruli, a dish of meat cooked in a milky garlic sauce, probably our favourite food discovery in the country of Georgia (also a perfect complement to the wine of course). If you’re searching for an off-the-beaten path destination with some adventure, be sure to put the country of Georgia on your list, you won’t be disappointed!"https://outoftownblog.com/your-place-or-mainz-three-reasons-why-mainz-is-your-new-go-to-city-in-germany/,germany,"The city of Mainz had its beginnings as a Roman-founded city. It is one of the first military bases founded on the Rhine by the Romans. Allegedly, one can trace its birth to 13 B.C., when Mainz was called “ Mogontiacum “. Mainz’s founding can be attributed to Drusus, the adopted son of the Roman Emperor Augustus. From it, the city became one of the Roman Empire’s — then Europe’s —  important port cities. Over hundreds of years Mainz evolved from a legion camp or military base to a city known for one of the best inventions the world has ever seen. You’ll find out below the reasons why Mainz should be your new go-to city. Looking for Best Hotels in Mainz? Visit Agoda to save time and money on your hotel selection with millions of reviews and options to choose from. Mainz Cathedral Why Mainz Should Be Your Main Squeeze 1. You love wine as much as you love Germany. Yeah, I get it. We all know that Germany is known first and foremost for its beer. But did you know that Germany is also known for its wines? The city of Mainz is Germany’s wine capital and it plays host to many different wineries. The city is so well-known with regards to wines because of its location: Mainz is conveniently seated within a region called Rheinhessen, an important area for wine production. Can’t go to France for that tasty red or white stuff? You can get it right here in Germany. Wine Cellar Kupferberg Wine Cellar Kupferberg, one of Mainz’s oldest wineries. This winery boasts a deep cellar with seven layers. 2. You want charm? Mainz will give it to you. If you’ve seen a lot of cities that looks quite similar in feel, pack your bags and a take a trip down to Mainz. Believe me when I say that Mainz looks especially interesting when the sun is out. At the time of our visit, I became so excited when the sun came round because it gave Mainz its friendly allure. Kirschgarten This photo of a portion of the Kirschgarten is my favourite. All because of this quaint Fachwerk in the middle of the street with the Mainz Cathedral peeking behind. I just find it really charming. Middle of Kirschgarten Kirschgarten is an area within the Mainz Alstadt where you can find an array of Fachwerke or timber-framed houses. This photo above was taken right in the middle of the Kirschgarten itself. Despite the name, there wasn’t any cherry trees standing nearby. Kirschgarten in Mainz Germany If you’re into long photowalks, the Altstadt is simply the best place to do that. 3. Mainz is a city of the one of the world’s most important inventions Johannes Gutenberg is Mainz’s most famous person especially because he was born here. Not to mention that it was in this very city the movable-type printing press was created. In the city center you will find the house where he was born. Unfortunately we were not able to pay a visit because it was closed. Oh, the downside of touring a city on a New Year’s Day. Gutenberg Right in the middle of the Altstadt is the statue of the famous son of the city himself. Without him, we would not enjoy the opportunity of holding and reading books. This wraps up our visit to the city of Mainz. See you on the next city we’ll visit! Fachwerke – Why Mainz Is Your New Go-To City in Germany How to reach Mainz: The city is quite near Frankfurt am Main! All it takes is just one train ride from the Frankfurt Central Station to Mainz Central Station. The journey takes around 40 minutes."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-frankfurt/,germany,"What makes Frankfurt a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Frankfurt is a city of money, skyscrapers and class, all wrapped up in a German style ribbon for you to admire. As it is the banking capital of Europe, it is a city full of suits, fast walking and business lunches, but that only adds to the hustle and bustle city feel of what’s going on here. From 5 star restaurants to simple coffee shops, most places have impressive and (in some instances) skyline views of the city because like a lot of popular German cities, Frankfurt is dressed to impress no matter what.   What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? I always recommend the Roomers hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay in Frankfurt. It’s the hotel Dan and I stayed at on our wedding night and as we married very early in the morning at a registry office, we spent most of our day basking in the glory that is the Roomers hotel! If you stay there, make sure to visit their spa on the top floor. It’s where we spent most of our time and in the week it’s so quiet that you’ll easily have the whole place to yourself! What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Aside from the Roomers (which I am clearly obsessed with!), I have heard good things about Hotel Concorde and The Westin Grand Hotel . Particularly the latter, which is a not-so-expensive but not-so-cheap hotel in the city centre with a bathtub big enough for two and a bed fit for a king! Alternatively, there are a lot of cheap hotel options in Frankfurt still within a short distance to the city centre, due to the fact that this city isn’t very big. Providing you are an uBahn journey away from the city centre, you can assume most places to be within a suitable distance. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? The boat tours along the River Main are not to be missed! I’ve taken several since we lived here and they are best enjoyed from April – October, when you are likely to have the sun shining and enjoying a nice glass of champagne as you watch the city go by. I’ve shared a post on 5 Things To Do On Your Trip To Frankfurt where I share the best (naked!) spas to visit, restaurants and more insider tips. Something I am yet to do (but will be doing this year) is the Fairytale Route which isn’t exclusive to Frankfurt but starts closeby. If you’re looking for an adventure around castles that inspired fairytale stories, then it’s right up your alley! Where are the best hang outs during the day? I would have to say that one of the many parks that surround the city. Not only is the inner city surrounded by parks (take a look at it on a map to see what I mean!) but many small boroughs within it have their own parks too. My favourite is Gruneberg Park which is a ten minute walk out of the city centre. If you’re looking to grab a warm drink and enjoy some crazy cool decor, then I recommend Ohne Name (no name) in the city for the best hot chocolate you’ve ever tasted ! If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Frankfurt and what are their best dishes? Dan and I love to frequent Im Herzen Afrikas, an Ethiopian style restaurant with great prices for a fantastic service. The restaurant has low lighting, (optional) low seating so that you are almost on the floor, which is covered in thick sand, and a relaxed atmosphere. I recommend ordering the sharing platter (which you can order for as many people as you like) for some of the most delicious spice mixes you’ll ever encounter! Make sure to order an African beer with your meal and ask for a table ‘in the sand’ at the front of the restaurant. It’s an unforgettable experience! The closest uBahn station to Im Herzen Afrikas is ‘Willy-Brandt-Platz’, which is just a five minute walk away. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Sugar Mama (near the river) has the most amazing cookies I’ve ever tasted! Alternatively, head to the MyZeil mall in the centre of the city and grab an ice cream from Dulce. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? I am always on the hunt for local designers here, unfortunately one of my favourite places in the city that showcased a lot of local work just closed down. The best way to spot local designers and see what’s on trend is to check out the Fashion and Design festival “Stilbluten” which is normally around November/December. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Frankfurt? Spas are covered in the post I mentioned above (and a few others on my blog), but for a salon I highly recommend Headlines Haircutting in the Westend area. All of the staff speak English, are super friendly and have years of experience, not to mention years of fantastic reviews! Since living here, I’ve only let these guys touch my hair after a very bad experience when living in Paris! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Head to Frankfurt’s love lock bridge (Eiserner Steg) and watch the sunset behind the skyline. It’s breathtaking! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. When we aren’t pre-gaming at home, we tend to head to The Parlour which is an exclusive bar in the city that is known as a secret bar. It has no markings outside and a buzzer will put you through to the doorman who decides if you look presentable enough to enter. From there, you are paying over 10 euro for some of the strongest and tastiest drinks you’ll have ever encountered. The Parlour is also a great place to spend the whole evening, but it can get pretty costly, particularly if you are buying drinks in rounds, so I recommend pre-gaming there before heading somewhere else in the city. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? If you’re looking to dance all night in the city centre, I recommend Club Gibson. It has different themed nights throughout the week and it’s big enough to not feel overly cramped, even on super busy evenings. If you’re looking for more of a tequila dive bar with sticky seats but a real ‘night life’ vibe, then you have to head towards the Sachsenhausen area, Alt-Sachsenhausen in particular. It’s a fairly pretty area in the day, but at night it turns into an almost street party with all of the partiers spilling out of the bars and into the street. If you find yourself here, head to Anglo Irish Pub for good music, cheap beer and a lively atmosphere."ttps://hippie-inheels.com/a-luxury-guide-to-hamburg-germany/,germany,"Hamburg is one of the three cities in Germany with over one million inhabitants. It has the biggest seaport in Germany and is such a charming and chic metropolis. It is this certain atmosphere Hamburg exudes that makes you want to wear your best clothes, wander the streets, sit down for coffee and cake and simply feel a bit…special. There are many posh areas, boutiques as well as restaurants and cafés. If you feel like spending money, look no further. I have been to Hamburg numerous times – for weekend getaways or simply a few relaxed Saturdays – due to the fact that it only takes about an hour by car from where I live to get there. Whether it is with my family, a friend or boyfriend, the Marriott in Hamburg’s heart  is a 5 star hotel close to all the amenities as well as shopping area and restaurants. You won’t be disappointed, for the Marriott makes your heart flutter. What makes Hamburg a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? First of all, Hamburg itself is glamorous. There are so many fancy hotels and bars as well as entertainment possibilities that there is something for everyone. You probably wouldn’t know where to start. Also, Hamburg is different, for it is located right at the river Elbe, which means that there are quite a few hotels, restaurants etc. offering a stunning view on the river or port, which adds to a great atmosphere. Moreover, don’t miss a boat trip. They give you a different perspective on this beautiful city. It’s not without good reason that Hamburg is oftentimes referred to as the “Pear of the German North”. What boutique hotel would you recommend to your friends that are stopping through? As mentioned before: stay at the Hamburg Marriott . It’s a place which leaves nothing to be desired. The rooms are very modern, yet cozy with a king size bed, wifi and 24-hour room service. A gym as well as a swimming pool and spa offers help you relax and forget the hustle and bustle of the city for a little while. Right outside of the hotel is the so-called Gänsemarkt, with many independent and thus unique boutiques . Shopping, anyone? Come back to the hotel to finish off the day in the Piano Bar or eat at the restaurant. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? You will never get bored in Hamburg. Some of the things you should consider doing are the following, for example: 1. “Call a Bike” and gain an overview of the city. This is an excellent way to be active while getting familiar with the city – ideally on a sunny day. The “call a bike” concept is simple: you have to register on the internet in advance and then you are good to go, wherever you want to, as long as you wish. The bicycles are sponsored by the German national rail company and can be found in about fifty German cities. Once you have registered, you are allowed to use them all. You will be asked for your mobile phone number in order to be sent the code, which you have to type into a little display on the bike of your choice. There are 120 drop-off stations in Hamburg, which means the nearest one is not far once you decide to end your cycling tour. After having dropped-off the bike, the amount will be deducted from your credit card. It is free for 30 minutes; afterwards it costs 4 cents per minute and 6 cents per minute after one hour. If you choose to borrow it for 24 hours, you will have to pay 12 Euros. 2. See Hamburg from a boat. If you are keen on going on a boat trip to see Hamburg from a different angle, you don’t have to go far as they start right from there. The Alster trip is an old classic and you should give it a try. Boats leave every 30 minutes and the tour last approximately an hour. With 14,50 Euros per person, this can still be considered affordable. Once you’ve made it to the Außenalster, rent a pedal boat and drift. If you feel like exercising, grab your jogging shoes and enjoy a scenic, “green” run. even a rainy day in Hamburg is great! 3. Check out the Kiez. The famous Reeperbahn and St. Pauli make up the so-called Kiez. The Reeperbahn – within walking distance from the port – is not only St. Pauli’s but also Hamburg’s main entertainment quarter. Apart from that, it’s known for its iconic red-light district. Many tourists come there just to get a feel for the “edgy” atmosphere. This part of the city is especially vibrant after dark, when the bars and clubs come to life. Also, the most famous police station in Germany, the so-called Davidwache, can be found here and makes the area safe. You should definitely see the “Große Freiheit” (Great Freedom), which is one of the side streets where you can find most of the music-clubs. 4. Be sure to visit the fish market. Get up early and dive into the hustle and bustle of the “Fischmarkt.” Hamburg and fish? That’s a must. Fresh fish is even better and so you should roll out of bed early on a Sunday morning to experience the fish market. If you don’t feel like getting up early, have an all-nigh-party and then pay a visit to the Fischmarkt afterwards. You might be surprised at first but it is indeed common that people dance to live music in the early morning hours. It’s only open from 5am – 9.30am (April until October) in the morning but worth the experience. Where are the best hang outs during the day? When in Blankenese , you hardly feel as if you are in a big city. This rather suburban area is located right at the river Elbe and makes this part of Hamburg very idyllic. Blankenese is a former fishing village and the little houses have their own charm. It has become one of the rather posh parts of Hamburg . A few of the houses are located on a hill and only accessible via a staircase with 5,000 steps. The surrounding is beautiful and a long walk along the river adds to a relaxed afternoon. The Speicherstadt – or warehouse district – is what characterizes Hamburg and reminds of the active ship trade in former times. It is now under a preservation order. If you are interested in the brief history, then a boat trip through the canal is the right choice as is the Speicherstadt Museum. Also, The HafenCity (or HarbourCity) is a district surrounded by courses of a river and the most significant urban development project in Hamburg. Rather expensive residential property is emerging which is well-worth a look. I can assure you: some apartments will make you want to move to this city. Afterwards, go for a stroll along the port and do ship-watching while grabbing some fries on the go. The Binnen- and Außenalster are one of the most iconic places in Hamburg. The Alster is a tributary of the river Elbe and in the area around the Binnenalster, you will find many cafés, chic hotels, such as the Four Seasons or the Atlantic Kempinski Hamburg, and many extraordinary – or even more ordinary – shopping opportunities. Make sure you grab a drink or a bite to eat at the “Alex ” as you will have a great view over the Binnenalster . If you are keen on going on a boat trip to see Hamburg from a different angle, you don’t have to go far as they start right from there. The Alster trip is an old classic and you should give it a try. Boats leave every 30 minutes and the tour last approximately an hour. With 14,50 Euros per person, this can still be considered affordable. Once you’ve made it to the Außenalster, rent a pedal boat and drift . If you feel like exercising, grab your jogging shoes and enjoy a scenic, “green” run. view from town hall If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Hamburg and what are their best dishes? Have sushi at the White Lounge. I was introduced to this design restaurant a couple of years ago, in the course of a so called “lying dinner.” For all the sushi lovers out there, the White Lounge in Winderhude is a hotspot you have to give try. All covered in white, freshly made sushi and dimmed light – the perfect atmosphere for a romantic dinner. If you even want your very personal space, you can book your private, cosy section of the restaurant with a view on the canal. It’s like a sofa lounge where you can make yourself as comfy as you would in your own living-room while enjoying fresh Asian food . It definitely is a somewhat different dinner experience if you choose this option. I would also recommend booking in advance. Also, try the Tschebull   located at the Mönckebergstraße, which is very stylish and impresses with an alpine decoration. Hearty Austrian food is what they cook. Well-known and very romantic is the La Luna , an Italian restaurant with candle light. Go for one of their pasta dishes – everyone likes them! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? It is not a surprise that, due to the fact that Hamburg is such a charming, diverse city that has much to offer, many wealthy people live there in their big mansions. You can find them in the Elbchaussee , for instance, one of Hamburg’s most well-known residential streets. If you feel like spending some money, you can shop your way around the Binnenalster (Inner Alster Lake, an artificial lake) where many great stores and unique little boutiques are. Also, this is where you will find the Europa Passage , a shopping mall. If you haven’t gone crazy enough – shopping wise – go to the Mönckebergstraße , actually the main shopping district. It’s a shopaholic’s paradise. If you feel the need to re-energize in between times, there are bars, restaurants and cafés around. This is where you’ll find the boutiques! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? A walk by the port never gets old and is always something special in Hamburg. Beyond that, the Strandperle (Beach Pearl) at the beach right by the river Elbe in Altona is worth the visit. Beach flair, a cold drink, deck chairs and the sundown – what more could you ask for? In addition, the Cliff in Harvestehude is a posh little place for colorful cocktails and a great atmosphere – including one of the best spots to watch the sunset. Now the the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Enjoy cocktails with a view at the 20Up Bar . This is one of the more extraordinary bars and my all-time favourite. High above Hamburg and located at the 20 th floor of the Empire Riverside Hotel, you can indulge in delicious cocktails. The music and lighting are perfect and it’s a great opportunity to dress up (you are even advised to stick to the dress code), go for a pre-party or post-dinner drink and just soak in the great atmosphere and – last but not least – be amazed by the stunning view over Hamburg’s port. I highly recommend booking a table at the window maybe even weeks before your trip because this bar is always crowded and you want to avoid disappointment. You can, of course, try your luck but there’s only a remote chance that you will get a table. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? The Reeperbahn in general is a good starting point. Don’t miss the Große Freiheit 36 , the venue where the Beatles and Lenny Kravitz as well as Chris Isaak have performed already, inter alia. The Große Freiheit is Hamburg’s most iconic party area. What else is there you can do apart from dancing the night away? Go see a musical, theatre performance or cabaret .This is what I get very excited about when I am in Hamburg. Dirty Dancing, Phantom of the Opera, Tarzan, The Lion King – I am a total freak when it comes to musicals. The latter, I have even seen four times. The city offers a wide range of musicals, theatre performances or traditional cabaret. The best way to make sure you get the evening entertainment you want is to book online. As for cabaret and theatre, the Schmidt’s Tivoli located right on the Reeperbahn is one of the iconic theatres. The Imperial Theatre is also worth a visit. If you feel like being more spontaneous, you can get discount tickets at the evening box-office. However, due to oftentimes high demand performances sell out quickly."https://hippie-inheels.com/walking-tour-in-berlin/,germany,"Why You Should Take a Walking Tour in Berlin It might be a bit nerdy, but I love taking walking tours through European cities , like Madrid. I absolutely adore hearing how each one of them single-handedly ended WW2, or how they fought the most important battle of the war. I leave each city a believer in how strong the citizens are. Berlin was no different, except I had a walking tour that brought tears to my eyes. This is one example of why you should take a walking tour in Berlin. Hope you are ready for a history lesson! Because I am from the U.S. and WW2 wasn’t fought in my hometown or state for that matter, it seems far away, and like it was a long time ago. Being in Berlin, it was a big reminder it wasn’t that long ago at all . Our guide was magnificent, although not German (most guides are Australian or English travelers trying to make a few bucks), she told various stories about how the wall came down and about lovers separated and reunited again. She told us clever ways Germans used to get past the wall. Some of the love stories were so tragic I cried (but keep in mind a good commercial can make me cry, it doesn’t take much). Holocaust memorial She took us to a parking lot and said, “This is where Hitler died”. Berlin thought he deserved a parking lot over his burial site, instead of a tombstone. There were no signs or any indication that this was where his life ended. where hitler died, a parking lot One part that really caught my attention was the square, Babelplatz where they burned 20,000 books by greats like Marx and Freud. Having been a huge fan of the book,   The Book Thief , it was very sad to see. Next to the space that commemorates the books burnt is a quote from well before the Holocaust occurred. “That was only a prelude, there where they burn books, they burn in the end people.” -Heinrich Heine (1820) the space commemorates the 20,000 books burnt, to the right is the original quote Mother with her dead son’ a sculpture that is a memorial to the victims of fascism and militarism On a softer note, she also showed us where Michael Jackson dangled his baby out the window. Yikes. We wandered through the huge blocks at the Holocaust Memorial , which I was bothered to see kids sitting on and smoking weed.  She took us through areas in which old buildings have bullet holes from the war. We saw old checkpoints for the wall, and propaganda from Hitler that was used against the German people. Nazi propaganda- what they wanted the German’s to think life was like, painted on a wall on the ground, in front of the propaganda wall, a photo of what life was REALLY like I consider myself a history fan, although my lack of long-term memory means that if you ask me a question I’ll likely not be able to remember what I was taught. These walking tours make it nearly impossible to forget because you’re seeing it with your own eyes and the stories get stuck in your head. I recommend being a nerd in each European city and letting someone guide you through a tour. They may be free, but remember to tip whatever you think that tour was worth! If you’re not as into history you could consider a street art in Berlin tour or even a food tour. look at all those bullet holes!"https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,germany,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,germany,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-for-visiting-katerini-litochoro-olympus-greece/,greece,"Taking a “Real” Vacation in Katerini, Litochoro, and Olympus Greece When people picture Greece it’s usually the islands or Athens. About 8 years ago, I went to Mykonos , Santorini , Corfu , and Athens myself and it was amazing. But some people say that the islands are not like the real Greece and advise that you should see more! In this post, I’ll give you some tips for visiting Katerini and a couple other places in Greece we visited. Ben’s dad and long-term girlfriend live in Vienna but she is Greek and from the town Katerini, near Thessaloniki (the second biggest city in Greece). Her family is still there and they have an apartment there; we’ve always wanted to go and visit. We had decided a long time ago to visit and also go to the “three fingers”, Halkidiki Penninsula, nearby which are really famous. As always we over-estimated time and decided it would be better to explore closer to Katerini. So, we ended up spending a few nights in Katerini, a few nights in Litochoro (Mt. Olympus, home of Zeus), and the last few days in Plaka on the beach. It was the first real vacation I’ve taken in a while where I didn’t worry about blogging so it was nice to relax. Prior to that, we had even more vacation time at Ben’s dad’s in Vienna. So, it was basically two weeks of vacation and no blogging! I love to blog, but it’s nice to be abroad and not always thinking about what I’ll write about. I am not writing about our time in Austria as I have already on previous visits . Since I wasn’t really focusing on blogging, I’m combining all three of these cities we visited in Greece into one blog post! Getting to Katerini The easiest way to get to any of the places we visited is by flying to Thessaloniki. It’s a small airport and about 15 minutes outside of the city center. I came from India, so flew Turkish Airlines which is one of online two airlines that do easy routes from India to Greece. I had to go to Alanya for work anyway, so it worked out perfectly. I’ve actually flown TA the last three big international flights I’ve done, and love them. We stayed at an airport hotel the night we arrived and the night before we left. We stayed at the Ambassador both times. It ranges between $60-$100. Good hotel, amazing pool. We got a rental car with Sixt at the airport, booking ahead of time. Reason being the other rental car options are really far from the lot and you even have to take a taxi to them instead of a shuttle. I can’t remember the rental car price, but it was cheap! It was supposed to have an option to buy GPS but they didn’t have the devices. So, Ben bought a Vodafone SIM card. It was necessary but still didn’t offer good service. From Thessaloniki, you can drive about an hour South to Katerini and from there the rest is all close by. Thessaloniki is cool but I didn’t stay long, so won’t write about it on this post. Tips on Visiting Katerini Katerini is called the heart of Macedonia. It’s a cute town on its own but also a good base to explore from. From here you can visit: Dion. where there are a lot of ancient ruins at archeological sites Platamanos Castle. looked amazing from below but didn’t go inside. It actually looked closed when we tried to! Olympus. Many people stay here to trek Mt Olympus. The town center in Katerini isn’t huge and you can easily walk everywhere. Ben new his way around in two days but I’m directionally challenged so would advise GPS here if you are like me! We spent a lot of time here eating, go figure. We met with Ben’s family in Katerini and they were so nice! They took us to the best place to eat and I ordered just about everything. I got a business card so I could share the name and when I just looked at it- it’s in GREEK! lol I can’t even try to tell you the name. We also drove to a nearby beach and had a mediocre meal, below – so I won’t bother sharing about the name of the restaurant! The last night there we ate at another yummy place, that unfortunately, I’m useless and don’t know the name. Like I said, I wasn’t thinking about blogging on this trip. Sorry! But, I had all good food here except one meal, which was still “okay” so I think you’ll be fine just popping in anywhere. It seems all Greeks know how to cook! Below is the castle that I mentioned above, which was closed when we went to it.  Mt. Olympus / Litochoro Tips This is really a place to come is you want to trek and hike. Other than that, it’s a cozy town with great views. It is good because you get the views of the sea and the mountains. Our hotel, Hotel Olympus Mediterranean, offered both and I highly recommend it. Click here for rates and reviews . It had amazing views! You can’t really see through the clouds, but you can see the sea and to the left are the mountains. The room was really old-fashioned looking which I liked. It was the coziest little room! It was a five minute walk to the town center. When you arrive here, you can park outside the hotel but be warned it is really tiny alleys here so rent a compact car! We drove to the Mountain because we weren’t all that prepared to hikini (nor were we interested in it). The views were great on the drive up and down and roads were safe. We went to Zeus’s waterfall, which turns out you can’t hike to but have to look at from afar. The town square had cafes around it and was typically full of local men or tourists in trekking outfits. There were some sport shops, fruit stalls, and random little shops but nothing to buy, really. I liked it more getting lost in the alleys!  Of course, there was a lot of food and we went to Erato Wine restaurant. It was the cutest one from the outside and when I googled ‘best food in town’, it came up first. Easy choice! It was SO tasty, huge portions, and really affordable. I got a bottle of wine for $9. What! Crazy, I know. Seriously, look at the size of this steak! Plaka &amp; Nearby Beaches We really didn’t plan this trip so when we went to the Plaka area, it was because we wanted to see this part of the coast and because we wanted to stay at Cavo Olympo . It was a great boutique hotel (you can see rates and reviews here ). We used the hotel as our base and drove to random beaches nearby. Plaka was the best and the others were about the same, some more touristy than others. Olympus Beach was pretty crowded but good if you’re getting bored and want something to do. This restaurant, Taverna Agorastos, was our favorite place we tried. I fed all my prawn heads to the cats and they went crazy for them! The whole area is really dead; we only saw one other group of tourists on this whole beach while we were there. It was late May, so not a crazy time of year, but I guess still too cold for tourists to want to come. So, overall, that’s what we got up to! Nothing crazy, but a great holiday in a really quiet beautiful place. If you are looking for loads of culture and a popping nightlife, you might want something more like Athens, but if you just want to relax you can get a wide range of things to do here from archeological visits, to mountain treks, or just chill at one of the many beaches."https://hippie-inheels.com/pink-palace-corfu/,greece,"Curse of the Pink Palace in Corfu After 24 hours of travel and sleeping on lawn chairs, we got off the ferry in Corfu. The van from our chosen hostel, the Pink Palace, awaited us. “Have a shot of ouzo! You must!” said the way-too-cheerful-for-6AM Greek man. Drinking was the LAST thing I wanted to do, but Greeks have a way of making it impossible to say no to alcohol. That was the start of me remembering hardly anything about the beautiful island of Corfu. The windy road up to the hostel was the last I would see outside “the palace”. People actually argued over who got to sleep on lawn chairs View from our balcony; I almost always handwash my clothes The Pink Palace The staff at the Pink Palace makes sure there is absolutely no reason to leave. The Hotel California of Greece. Usually, one of the first things I do when I arrive somewhere I’ll only be staying a short time is plan how I’ll be leaving &amp; to where. The goal was Croatia. Should have planned a little better, because we found out that it would cost us 100 euro and a layover in Bari, Italy… wasting a day of our trip. It was looking like our only option until someone mentioned a “weekly” ferry to Albania. (I don’t believe that a ferry only goes once a week, but this was what everyone kept telling us.) We chose the cheaper option of ferry to Albania, the only place people wrongly warned us not go , and planned to hitchhike to Croatia. Once plans were settled, the party started.   Horrible little ferry “the dolphin” we booked out (caused some serious sea-sickness)  The 20 euros a night was a steal considering all that was available. The hostel is located on a peaceful strip of the Ionian Sea. Along with some Swedish friends, we tried to swim to an island in the distance, which turned out to be just a rock, duh, hoping to find a hippie commune like on “The Beach”. Unfortunately, we had to turn back, gasping for air on the rocky beach. All day was happy hour . Drinks were free… so were t-shirts. I don’t know if it’s because we were girls, or if boys got free drinks too. When dinnertime rolled around I could barely stand up. A deliciously free dinner each night in a reception hall, followed by prom… or it might as well have been. Lots of Grease and ABBA. The place cleared out as couples went home together until only Megan and I were left on the dance floor (champs). Before I knew it, I was seasick and drunk on a tiny little ferry to Albania, wondering where the time went. dance party working off the all-you-can-eat calories Everyone I’ve met that went to Corfu has been to the Pink Palace; it’s ranked all over the Internet as one the best party hostels in Europe. And it didn’t disappoint. The problem was, everything was so accessible and free that we never wanted to leave. I never saw the town in Corfu or tried any local restaurants. When Greeks ask if I’ve been to Corfu, I might as well say no, as I never left my hostel. My advice if you visit is stay at the Pink Palace and party your ass off, then check out and stay at a hotel in town to get the local experience."https://hippie-inheels.com/3-magical-visits-to-visit-on-lake-atitlan-guatemala/,guatemala,"3 Magical Villages to Visit on Lake Atitlan, Guatemala: Yoga, Volcanoes, &amp; Mayan Culture There is so much to do in Guatemala but visiting the local villages is one of the most memorable experiences. I am going to share 3 villages to visit on Lake Atitlan, Guatemala. The first time I visited Lake Atitlan, Guatemala I did a sunrise hike up to one of the tall peaks surrounding the lake. We arrived at the top just as the sun started peeking through the volcanoes and reflecting off the shimmering surface of the lake. It was one of a handful of special moments while traveling when I’ve been completely awestruck. It was so special that I did it again the next time I visited, a couple years later!  Guatemala is a very traditional country, with Mayan people making up over half the population. The towns around Lake Atitlan, a huge crater lake surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, are dominated by traditional Mayan families. Once you make the 4-5 hour bumpy mountain drive from Antigua, you feel like you are in another world. There are 11 small villages around the lake, each with their own distinct personalities. The mountain roads are difficult to drive, so most transportation is done by boat across the lake. Some towns aren’t even connected to the outside world by roads. This keeps the culture and the beautiful nature protected. On my two trips to Lake Atitlan, I’ve visited many of its villages. I highly suggest you visit as many as you can while there, but if you’re limited on time there are three that are especially magical. Read on to learn about the 3 best villages to visit on Lake Atitlan, Guatemala – including where to stay, where to eat, and what to do while you’re there! 3 Magical Villages to Visit on Lake Atitlan, Guatemala 1. San Marcos San Marcos La Laguna is a modern hippie’s heaven. While the small town is filled with Mayan locals, it’s also seen an influx of expats and travelers interested in yoga, meditation, and natural living. You can’t walk far before finding yoga studios, advertisements for reiki healing sessions, or organic cafes. You also have access from San Marcos to the beautiful sunrise hike at Indian’s Nose Mountain I mentioned earlier. I’ve spent a week and a half in this charming town and could have easily stayed longer! Where to Stay in San Marcos Lush I highly recommend the aptly named –  Lush Hotel. The grounds are just that, incredibly lush and green, jam packed full of tropical foliage, trees, and flowers. They have rooms for almost any budget – from small economic rooms, to spacious apartments with incredible views of the volcanoes and lake. All rooms are decorated artistically with pretty tile, colorful walls, lovely textiles, and local artisan goods. Budget Options If you prefer to stay in a hostel or are on a small budget, Circles Cafe &amp; Hostel has nice basic rooms in a central location. Or Hostal del Lago has a pretty location right on the lake at the edge of town. Where to Eat in San Marcos Il Giardino This was my favorite restaurant in San Marcos. It’s a romantic little cafe serving delicious Italian food. The service, the garden ambiance, and the food is all excellent! It’s about halfway down the main footpath to the dock. Restaurant Fe This is one of the more popular restaurants in San Marcos, right on the main footpath. The ambiance is nice – a big open room with low lighting. The pizzas were my favorite thing to eat here. Moonfish This restaurant on the main driving road through town is super vegetarian friendly. You can find everything from burritos, to falafel, to salads here. The ambiance is a pretty, open garden – and prices are very reasonable. Circles Cafe &amp; Hostel Circles has great fresh coffee, as well as organic salads, sandwiches, and breakfasts. Their garden in back is a pretty and comfortable place to hang out for awhile. Gypsy’s Juice Bar This tiny juice stand makes excellent fresh juices and smoothies. I happened to be sick with a cold for a few days when I arrived in San Marcos. I drank their intense ginger shots every day and felt better in no time! They also serve a little bit of food like bagels, sandwiches, and chili. What to Do in San Marcos Sunrise Hike to Indian’s Nose Mountain This is absolutely a must do as far as I’m concerned. It’s still one of my favorite travel experiences to date. There are 3 or 4 travel agencies in town, and all can arrange trips up the mountain. There are a couple of options – one where you take local transportation up to the hike starting point. This may include chicken busses, tuk-tuk’s and standing in the back of a pick-up truck (all while it’s still dark outside). I did this and loved it, but it’s definitely a bit adventurous. A second option is to take a private car to the hike starting point, which is a little bit more expensive but time effective and comfortable. Once you get to the town of Santa Clara, you follow your guide up a steep winding path up the mountain. If the timing works out, you arrive at the apex just before the sun hits the horizon. Then you can watch the sky and lake turn shades of blue, purple, yellow and orange as the towns below start to wake up. It’s definitely a magical sight! Get a Massage There are many massage therapists in town. Ask around at your hotel/hostel, or keep your eyes out for the many signs along the streets. Take a Yoga or Meditation Class There are usually several yoga classes in town each day. We tried the classes at La Paz and Hostal del Lago. Both were great, but I highly recommend the class at Hostal del Lago. It’s on a deck at the lake’s edge, so you can do your practice while gazing at a gorgeous view. 2. San Juan San Juan is a lovely little village that is much less touristy than some of the tourist hotspots like Panajachel and San Pedro. The main attractions here are the many women’s coops that make and sell beautiful and authentic Mayan textiles. This is a great place to do your shopping because the coops make sure that the women are compensated fairly for their amazing work. Where to Stay in San Juan I haven’t stayed in San Juan but have heard great things about Pa Muelle – a basic but clean and friendly hotel with a nice view of the lake, and the rustic Eco Hotel MayAchik up on the hill. Where to Eat in San Juan Alma de Colores This cute but modest cafe has great food. The original owners were Italian, and the cafe still serves European/Mediterranean food like quiches, salads, and falafel. The ambiance is simple but attractive, and the service is great. Cafe el Artesano You must make reservations a couple weeks in advance for this lovely little wine and cheese bar, but it’s worth it! They serve large varieties of gourmet cheese, nuts, figs, and cured meats. What to Do in San Juan Shop! This is the best pasttime in San Juan. There are a large number of women’s coops, all creating beautiful, well-made goods. Take a day to explore each one. Many of the coops also do weaving and natural dye demonstrations. The weaving is done by traditional backstrap loom, and the demonstrations are really interesting and informative! 3. Santa Cruz Santa Cruz la Laguna is even less touristed than San Juan. There is a little mini village at the lake’s edge where most of the hotels are. And then you can take a very steep walk or a tuk-tuk ride up to the town that lies 325 feet straight up the mountain. The town is very traditional and local, and is nice for a short exploration. The main reason to come to Santa Cruz is to enjoy the peaceful setting at the lake’s edge at one of the lovely hotels. This is a very relaxing and beautiful place. Where to Stay in Santa Cruz There are two amazing options in Santa Cruz depending on your budget: Isla Verde This is one of the cutest hotels I’ve seen in awhile. Their design was on point – everything felt thought out and beautiful. There are lots of cozy common areas to hang out, drink a beer, or do yoga. They have a nice deck right on the water to enjoy some food or a cocktail. Then they have a huge deck on the upper level dripping with plants and lots of comfy seating options. They also often have yoga classes, and a beautiful building to practice in. La Iguana Perdida This is a great option if you’re on a smaller budget. There are a variety of rooms, and comfortable common areas. The hostel is right on the water, with a great big deck to enjoy a meal or a drink. They also have yoga classes here. The best thing about La Iguana is their family style dinners. You sign up earlier in the day and are treated to a huge and delicious meal all together with the guests in the evening. There is usually a salad, a main course, and a dessert. We loved meeting other travelers while we enjoyed our dinner each night. Where to Eat in Santa Cruz Both hotels mentioned above have great food, and are also great for a happy hour cocktail with a view. Another option is to head up into town and stop at one of the local restaurants there. CECAP/Cafe Sabor Cruceno This little cafe has good food, and also a fantastic view of the lake. It sits right on the edge of the mountain overlooking the water. The cafe is associated with the nonprofit CECAP that provides education to local children in need. What to Do in Santa Cruz Relax ! This is the best thing to do in this quiet little village. Enjoy the scenery, sway in a hammock, and swim in the lake. Take a Walk to Jaibalito There is a very rustic wooden bridge/footpath that hugs the edge of the lake and takes you all the way to the even smaller village of Jaibalito. We didn’t make it all the way there because it was late in the afternoon, but we made it as far as Isla Verde and enjoyed a happy hour drink at the hotel before returning. Kayak You can rent kayaks from almost any hotel. Lake Atitlan is the perfect setting to paddle out and enjoy the view of the mountains and villages from out in the water. Yoga Many of the hotels have yoga classes. Ask around and join in! You’ll be in the perfect setting for it. Lake Atitlan is the perfect place to observe traditional Mayan culture, decompress from the fast-paced world, and enjoy gorgeous nature. I definitely recommend visiting the three magical and distinct villages of San Marcos, San Juan and Santa Cruz if you visit the area!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/10/iceland-holidays-tour-guide-reykjavik-itinerary-expenses/,iceland,"ICELAND ON A BUDGET: Reykjavik Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary 2017 Most people think that Iceland is expensive. Well, I hate to break it to you but, uhm, Iceland is really expensive. Reykjavik, its capital, is probably the most expensive city I’ve set foot in. It could cost you an arm, but you know what? It will treat your senses to an endless succession of wonder that you will gladly give your other arm for another go at it. That’s not to say that splurging is the only way to go. There are ways to minimize expenses, as we learned during our stay. And that is what we’re gonna share in this post.         WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Iceland and Reykjavik Iceland is remarkable in many ways. It’s one of the youngest landmasses on the planet geologically, formed when lava spewed by volcanoes rose to the surface of the ocean and accumulated over millions of years. Iceland rises directly above where new crust is created, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with one foot on the North American plate and the other on Eurasian plate, splitting the country apart. Imagine the crazy volcanic activities happening here, adding the latter bit to its nickname, “Land of Ice and Fire.” Iceland is also one of the last countries to be inhabited in Europe. According to tradition, its first permanent settler was the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson who arrived in the island in 874 CE. Yet, it has the world’s oldest national parliament that is still in existence, the Icelandic Alþingi (aka Althing or Althingi), the history of which can be traced to 930 at Þingvellir. Þingvellir, where the North American and Eurasian plates pull apart With only over 300,000 residents, Iceland is also one of the most sparsely populated countries in Europe. Two-thirds of the population lives in Reykjavik and nearby areas in the southwest edges of the island. Although it is Iceland’s economic and political center, Reykjavik is more like a big town than a city. It has preserved a nostalgic, rustic atmosphere, with no skyscrapers or giant shopping malls around. The currency is Icelandic Króna (ISK).100 ISK = around 0.79 Euro , 0.88 USD , or 42.42 PHP . Note: This travel guide is more about Reykjavik and the day tours from there. If you’re planning on visiting other parts of Iceland, this may not be suitable.   When is the Best Time to Visit It depends on what you’re in Iceland for. If you want to explore MUCH of the country — including the desolate and off-the-beaten-track lands of the north — the summer months of mid-June to early September are ideal. The temperature is pleasant, just playing around 20C, and there’s more daylight, which means more hours of exploring. Roads leading to the farthest corners of the island are open, too, and there are more public transportation options. Summer is also considered peak season so prepare for the expensive to be more expensive during this time. Strokkur Geyser But if you’re after the Northern Lights (like I was), you must visit between late September to late March. Reykjavik is the northernmost capital in the world, which means it is also the most accessible city for watching Aurora Borealis. The shoulder months of September, October, and March are great options not just because of the Lights but also because the rates are not as steep and the days are as long as the nights. If you visit in December-February, prepare for shorter days and average zero degrees. Note : It DOES feel colder in reality than what the forecast says because of the wind and the rain showers. Iceland’s climate is a bit extremely unpredictable. It’s sunshiny one time and then raining the next, so make sure you’re prepared for the cold (warm clothes!) even when it’s sunny when you leave your hotel.   How to Get to Reykjavik, Iceland First of all, know that Iceland is part of the Schengen Agreement, which means you will need a Schengen Visa to visit. Many travel to Iceland as part of a larger European trip, just like we did. (If you’re based in the Philippines, and Iceland is the only country you’re gonna visit on this trip, you may apply for a Schengen Visa at the Norwegian Embassy in Manila.) Reykjavik has its own airport, Reykjavik Airport (RKV), but it is used only for flights from and to other Icelandic towns, Faroe Islands, and Greenland. If you’re coming from another country, you’ll be landing at the Keflavik International Airport (KEF), which is an hour away from Reykjavik. Although other international airlines fly to and from Reykjavik, most flights are offered by Icelandair and WOW Air, with the latter being the budget choice. If your trip to Iceland is part of a longer Eurotrip, the cheapest flights to Reykjavik are usually those coming from London, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam. Take a look at the sample Skyscanner screenshots below for March (off-peak, but Northern Lights season). London-Reykjavik Copenhagen-Reykjavik Fares from Amsterdam and Paris look reasonable, too, but they’re not as cheap as those from Copenhagen and London. Same applies to outbound flights. If you’re coming from Manila, the cheapest flight would be via Turkish Airlines + Icelandair. You’ll find ROUNDTRIP tickets for less than PhP 28,000 for March (off-peak, Northern Lights) or for only PhP 31,000 for June (peak season, summer). See screenshots below. The key is to book waaay in advance. The early bird catches the best fares. Manila-Reykjavik, March Manila-Reykjavik, June   How to Get from Keflavik Airport to Reykjavik City Center Keflavik Airport is located an hour away from Reykjavik. It’s actually a small airport so don’t worry about getting lost or not finding your way around. To get to the city center, you have four options: A. Rent a Car If you can drive and have a driving license, you might want to consider this. I mean, REALLY consider this. Renting a car is by far the cheapest (if you’re a party of 2 or more) and most convenient way to get around Iceland. If you’re planning on renting a car to tour anyway, you might as well pick it up at the airport. You can arrange this before your flight or rent at the airport. (I’ll discuss more details in the section below. Scroll down.) If you can’t drive for whatever reason, you can: C. Take a FlyBus or Grayline Bus Most tourists end up taking this because they have very visible booths by the terminal exit. It’s slightly pricier than the public bus and they charge more if they drop you off at your hotel. Note that if you choose that they take you to your hotel and if your hotel is located in the Old Town, you will be switching to a smaller mini-bus/shuttle at the terminal because big buses are not allowed in the area. Here are the rates: GRAYLINE(one-way) To Grayline Terminal: EUR 20 (ISK 2400)To your Hotel: EUR 24 (ISK 2900) FLYBUS (one-way) To Reykjavik BSI Terminal: EUR 20 (ISK 2500)To your Hotel: EUR 24 (ISK 3000) Get Your Ticket Here  – C. Take the Public Bus This is the cheaper bus option. Iceland has a Public Bus System called Strætó, and it runs Bus 55 that plies the Keflavik Airport to Reykjavik route. Just look for the BUS 55 sign outside the terminal. Its final stop is the BSI Umferðarmiðstöðin, which is the city’s main bus terminal. You can take another bus or you can walk to your hotel from here. The downside here is that it’s not as frequent as the private buses. You may check the timetable here . Fare: 1760 ISK (14.5 Euro, 16.5 USD). Updated fares here . D. Take a mini-bus or shuttle There are also other companies like Reykjavik Sightseeing who could take you straight to your hotel without stopping or switching vehicles because they use a smaller shuttle all the way through. Fare: ISK 2990 (EUR 24).   Where to Stay Cheap in Reykjavik If you’re going on a road trip around the island, then you shouldn’t spend all your nights in Reykjavik. But if you can’t drive or not planning on visiting the farther corners of the country, it makes sense to use Reykjavik as your home base because most accommodations are here. The Old Town is the best place to stay because it’s the heart and soul of the city. It’s nice to walk around and there are plenty of reputable restaurants. When we were searching for hotels in Reykjavik, we were shocked. Our visit was in October but the rates were at least EUR 100 (USD 110) per night for a twin or double room at a “budget” hotel. The upscale ones would go over USD 1000 per night. Dorm beds were cheaper at around USD 25-55 per person (but I snore so scandalously, I wouldn’t want to put my roommates through it, haha, so it wasn’t an option for me). I tinkered with hotel booking engines and found that these are NORMAL rates for June-October. You can book private twin rooms at a budget hotel for as low as EUR 55 per night if your travel dates fall within the November to March period. Anyway, we ended up booking an apartment via AirBnB for only EUR 70 per night (+ EUR 42 service fee). I’ll write a separate entry about it soon.   Top Hostels in Reykjavik Reykjavik Downtown Hostel Vesturgata 17, Reykjavik City Center Check Rates Hostel B47 Baronsstigur 47, Reykjavik, Iceland, 101 Check Rates   Search for more: Reykjavik Hotels  – How to Get Around Reykjavik City Center Reykjavik is a small, walkable city. If you want to go around the city, go on foot. Unless the weather is sour or it’s extremely cold, of course. Otherwise, WALK. Should you really need to take the bus, here are the rates: Single ride: ISK 42020 ticket card: ISK 80001 day card: ISK 1,5003 day card: ISK 3,500 If you’re unsure about what to buy, opt for a single ride first and then try exploring the town on foot and see if you really need to ride the bus from your hotel to your destinations.   How to Visit Nearby Parts of Iceland from Reykjavik There are no railways in Iceland. Locals usually travel by car or by plane (for long distances within the country). But if you want to see the southern and southwestern parts of Iceland, which are the regions closest to Reykjavik, you have two options. Vik, Iceland’s southernmost village Option 1: By Car Like I said earlier, the cheapest and most convenient way to go around Iceland is by car. If you know how to drive and have a driving license, it makes perfect sense to drive. Why? Because public transportation options are scarce and tours are expensive. Car rental rates usually start at around EUR 100 (ISK 13,000, PHP 5500) for the first day and additional EUR 30-50 EUR for every succeeding day. That’s for a Hyundai I10, Suzuki Alto, or similar unit with unlimited mileage and can accommodate up to 4 passengers. A 5-day rental would probably cost EUR 210 (ISK 26,500) and a 6-day rental around EUR 270 (ISK 34,000). Add petrol/gas cost and insurance (around EUR5 per day), and these would be your only transportation expenses. If you’re a group of two or more, that’s a lot cheaper than joining group tours, which I will discuss later. Renting a car gives you not only savings but also flexibility. You can choose your stops and you can even opt to spend the night in another town so you don’t have to go to Reykjavik at the end of each day. Option 2: By Bus If you want to see much of Iceland other than those surrounding Reykjavik but you CAN’T drive, you can purchase a bus passport. This will allow you to hop on and off a bus system that would stop at many key attractions and towns. There are four routes to choose from. The most popular is the FULL CIRCLE passport that will allow you to travel around the country in one direction, which can start and end in Reykjavik. It costs EUR 300 (ISK 37,900). Here’s the catch, it’s only available during summer, mid-June to early September. Also, in my opinion, to maximize its value (because it’s pricey), it’s only ideal if (1) you’re staying in Iceland for at least a week, and (2) you want to see the eastern and northern parts of the country. More information about bus passports here . You may also take the public buses, but bear in mind the schedule for the route you want to take and the frequency of trips. More info here: Iceland Public Bus Schedule . Option 3: Group Tours If you can’t drive and you don’t want to wrap your head around bus timings, you can join a group tour. We can drive but we don’t have a valid license so we ended up joining group tours instead. Like all the other things in Iceland, it’s pretty costly but efficient. There are many tour operators in Iceland including Reykjavik Excursions, Iceland Excursions, Extreme Iceland, Bus Travel Iceland, and Guide to Iceland. They’re offering mostly the same tours and the prices do not vary greatly. The cheapest I found was Reykjavik Sightseeing , but the margin isn’t that wide, to be honest. Still, every krona counts so we went with them for our tours. The tour was pleasant to say the least. The driver serves as the guide, too, and we were given audio guides that automatically play recordings containing more information about the site when we’re approaching it. It’s pretty cool and handy. The only downside is the very limited time spent at the sites themselves. At the Gullfoss Waterfall, we were given only 30 minutes to explore, which was too tight if we really wanted to see the cascades up close. We were running the whole time just to make sure we would be back in the bus on time. We also didn’t take enough photos because of the same reason. Other than that, it was a great experience.   Day Tours from Reykjavik (And a Night Tour) There are a lot of marvelous sites in Iceland that are easily accessible from Reykjavik. But here are the four most popular. If it’s your first time to book with Klook and you’re based in the Philippines, use the promo code KLOOKTPT to get a P200 discount on your first booking! Valid until December 31, 2017 only.   Northern Lights Tour Aurora Borealis in Reykjavik If you’re in Iceland between mid-September and mid-March, then you’ll have a chance to see the Northern Lights. The tour usually starts at 8pm or 9pm and lasts 3-4 hours. Book this early. This tour should be the first thing you do on your first night in Iceland because it is HIGHLY dependent on the weather and solar activity. There is no guarantee that it will appear. If the conditions are not right and it doesn’t appear on your schedule, the tour company will move your trip to the next night and you get to try again for FREE. Booking this on your first night gives you more chances to see it because you can keep on moving it to the next night until the end of your stay in Iceland. If the elusive lights are still too shy on your last night in the island, most companies will give you a refund.Duration : 3-4 hours.Rates : ISK 5990 – 6500 (EUR 47-52).  ___ Blue Lagoon Photo provided by Klook. This geothermal spa has emerged as one of the most popular destinations in the country. Situated between Reykjavik and Keflavik, this is ideally visited on your way to the city center from the airport (or vice versa) to save money. There are buses going straight to the Blue Lagoon from the airport. The most efficient way of doing it is if you book your transfers with your ticket. You can have the service pick you up at the airport and drop you off in Reykjavik City Center. Standard Rates : EUR 40, winter; EUR 50, summer.Additional EUR 32 for the transfers. However, if that’s not ideal for you, you can also just go on a day tour from Reykjavik. Klook offers roundtrip transfers from Reykjavik with their tickets. Slots are extremely limited so make sure you book in advance. Reserve Tickets Here  ___ Golden Circle Tour Gullfoss, part of the Golden Circle This tour will take you deeper inland to see many of the island’s most remarkable sites including the following: Þingvellir National Park , a UNESCO World Heritage Site where the American and Eurasian plates pull apart; Geysir Hot Springs , where you can watch the Strokkur Geyser’s steaming water shoot skyward; Gullfoss Waterfall , a spectacular cascade formed as a glacial river plummets 32 meters into a deep canyon; Kerið , a volcanic crater that was created when a large magma chamber collapsed. This tour is usually referred to as Golden Circle CLASSIC because other companies combine it with other activities such as a glacier visit and Northern Lights tour (for a lot higher fees). Duration : 8 hours.Classic Rates : ISK 9,890-12,000 (EUR 79-95) Klook’s tour is a bit longer, about 9 hours, and at a slightly discounted price!

Here are the stops of this tour: Reynisfjara Beach , where you can watch the turbulent waves of the North Atlantic slap its black, sandy shore. It’s also here that you can get up close with the basalt stacks, a captivating rock formation; Vík , Iceland’s southernmost village. It’s small and sleepy (with only 300 residents), but always postcard-worthy. This is usually the lunch stop. Skógafoss , a rainbow-framed waterfall that never fails to captivate Seljalandsfoss , a 60-meter tall waterfall that conceals a walking trail behind its cascade. Yep, you can walk around it and behind the water column, but prepare to get wet a little bit. Eyjafjallajökull , a glacier-capped volcano that messed up Europe’s aviation industry a few years ago when it erupted. You won’t be getting close to it, just admire it from a distance. Duration : 10-12 hoursClassic Rate : ISK 12,990-14,000 (EUR 108-112) You can save 5 euro if you book with Klook. Klook’s tour also stop at Skogar Folk Museum! Book This Tour  ___ South Coast Tour with Glacier Walk Image provided by Klook The South Coast Tour is also usually combined with other tours, most often with an hour-long hiking tour of Sólheimajökull Glacier.

Hallgrímskirkja Church . An imposing structure inspired by the basalt columns that Iceland is also known for. Entrance is free of course, but if you want to climb to the tower for a great view of the city, you need to shell out ISK 700. Icelandic Phallological Museum . It houses the world’s largest collection of penises and penile parts (mostly from marine mammals). Einar Jónsson Art Museum and Sculpture Garden . The entrance fee to the museum is ISK 1000, but access to the Sculpture Garden is FREE. The garden boasts 26 bronze casts of Einar Jónssons work. City Hall and Tjörnin (The Pond) . A great example of late 20th century architecture in Iceland, the City Hall rises from the Tjörnin, where local children and grownups gather to feed ducks and spend some quality time together. Harpa Concert Hall . An impressive architectural wonder by the harbor, which is the home of the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra. However, if you want a deeper appreciation of the culture and history of the city, we recommend that you join a group tour! Join This Tour   Where to Eat Cheap in Reykjavik If you really want to save money, the best thing to do is pay a visit to a BONUS supermarket and purchase your food from there. You can even buy raw ingredients if your hostel or AirBnB allows cooking. Prices at Bonus are significantly cheaper than in convenience stores like 10-11, which also sell ready-made sandwiches, donuts, croissants, and cupped noodles. But if you really want to eat out, know that the city’s best restaurants serve fish. It’s their specialty, not surprising given the bounty that the surrounding waters provide. In fact, at dinner time, the Old Town’s atmosphere is filled with the delicious scent of fried fish, you’ll probably gonna crave it. We were able to ask a few locals (including our AirBnB host Helga) for places that they go to for “cheap” eats (by Icelandic standards). Here are their recommendations that we were able to try. Messinn . A small restaurant serving Scandinavian dishes. Messinn gave us the most delicious meal we’ve had on our weeks of traveling in Europe. Order the CURED SALMON (ISK 1100) for the entree and the PAN-FRIED ARCTIC CHAR (ISK 2100) for the main course. DIVINE. Krua Thai . This small, unassuming eatery near the Hallgrímskirkja Church offers giant plates and bowls of Thai favorites. Food here is so flavorful, it’s easy to forget you’re halfway around the world from Bangkok. Try their Panang Curry (ISK 1790), Chicken Noodle Soup (ISK 1490), and Spring Rolls (ISK 1550). This is our 2nd favorite resto in Reykjavik; we returned again and again. Fish and More (Salka Valka) . Their signature dish is the Traditional Plokkfiskur (ISK 2400), cod and haddock cooked with onions, herbs, and potatoes, and served with rice, veggies, butter, and rúgbrauð (Icelandic traditional bread). The place is pretty low-key and the menu short, but the servings and flavors big. Icelandic Fish and Chips . We were hesitant at first because we’re not a fan of fish and chips, but as we were walking by, it rained so we decided to just give it a try. It wasn’t as expensive as I dreaded it to be. They have this so-called “Recommended Sets,” which is a combination of fish (cod, ling, haddock) and a side (potatoes, salad, etc.) for only ISK 1700-ish. The fish was good but the potatoes were on the greasy side. Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur . It’s not a restaurant but a humble stall that offers what many consider the Best Hotdog in Europe (if not the world). We were lining up for it every single day of our stay in Iceland. Price: ISK 420. Vitabar . This was highly recommended by the locals we met, but we never had a chance to try it. Famous for their Blue Cheese Burger. Note that Icelandic serving sizes are HUGE. I’m a pretty heavy eater but it’s such a struggle for me to finish a dish even when they taste so good because there’s just so much food. For example, a single order of Arctic Char at Messinn will give you 3 large chunks of that fish; it’s basically good for 2. Helga, our AirBnB host, said that even she would share a dish with a friend because of this.   How to Stay Connected in Iceland The truth is, most accommodations in Iceland have free wi-fi, so connectivity isn’t really a problem. Even tour buses have free wi-fi. Hence, I did not include Internet cost in the breakdown of expenses above. However, I understand that some people want to stay connected ALL THE TIME. If you’re based in the Philippines, know that some telcos do not cover Iceland in their DATA ROAMING flat-rate offers and the P500/mb rate applies. For that, you can look for pocket-wifi router. Flytpack sponsored our connection in Iceland. It gives you unlimited data connection for Iceland (and many other countries) at a price lower than roaming services offered by some telcos and you can connect multiple devices hassle-free. Here are some reasons to consider: Cost of Flytpack for 5 days in Europe is only P2750. Because it can connect multiple devices, you can split cost with your companions. If you’re a group of 2, that’s only P1375 per person. Sure, you can always use the PERSONAL HOTSPOT feature of smartphones. But if you’re using an iPhone to connect through someone else’s data roaming, you’ll notice that you get disconnected after minutes of being idle. This does not happen with pocket wifi. The unit comes with a built-in power bank, which ensures you get to use it for an entire day tour without draining the battery. Each rental comes with a universal adaptor. Super useful! For more info about Flytpack, check this out . Flytpack Sample Itinerary and Expenses Below are two sample itineraries. The first is for those who are NOT able or willing to drive, the other for those who are. Both itineraries assume that: You will be staying for 5 days and 4 nights. This is better if Reykjavik is part of a longer Euro trip. If Iceland is the only place you’re visiting on this trip, you might want to stay longer. You will be using Reykjavik as your home base, meaning you will return to the capital at the end of every day to spend the night there. You will be shopping at the supermarket or convenience store for your meals most of the time but involves occasional eating out. You are a group of two, which means you are splitting the cost of accommodations and food (and transportation if you’re renting a car) with someone else. Anyway, here they are.

If you’re flying from Manila and you’re able to snag a P30,000 ticket, that puts the total cost at PHP 57,915 . This is a rough estimate, it will still depend on your spending habits. You can still bring down the cost if there are more of you in the group. (Or if you don’t eat out at all, but I recommend that you do just to have a taste of their traditional food.)   Seljalandsfoss, part of the South Coast Tour   More Budget Tips Here are some more tips that can help. Before you exit the airport terminal, you’ll pass by a Duty Free shop. The prices here are SIGNIFICANTLY lower than in the city center. Take advantage of this. Buy what you think would be useful to you at Duty Free. Goods at supermarkets are SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER than at convenience stores. I said that already, but for emphasis. Tap water is potable. On our first night, we bought a 2-liter bottle of water at a store, but the lovely lady at the counter (looks like she was also the manager) told us, “You do know that tap water is potable in Iceland, right? I just had to say that before I let you purchase this. I think it’s only fair.” Hitchhiking is not uncommon in Iceland, but you might be waiting for a long time and it can ruin your plans. There is a website where locals are calling for possible passengers on a ride-share basis. Basically, you can ride for free but you should pay your share on gas/petrol. Riders can also post calls for car-owners who will be driving to and from the same place. I haven’t tried it out myself so I can’t recommend it, but you may take a look here . When you’re joining group tours, there will be a lunch stop. Don’t feel pressured to eat at the restaurant. You can bring food that you can eat inside the bus. Or you can find a good spot. For example, at the lunch stop in Vik, behind the restaurants, closer to the beach, you’ll find benches and a table where you can have your packed lunch. It can be cold, though. Tipping is not mandatory in Iceland . Locals don’t tip, according to our host. But feel free to do so if you’re given exceptional service. Meal servings in Iceland are big. Split the food and cost with a friend. But I’ve said that already. This travel guide is a work in progress. I’ll be updating this regularly. If you have anything to add or you spot something that needs correcting, let me know!"https://hippie-inheels.com/top-5-reasons-to-make-a-stopover-in-iceland/,iceland,"Top 5 Reasons to Make a Stopover in Iceland Making a stopover in Iceland has been of my best travel decisions of 2017 thus far.  Yes, I know, Iceland is such a “trendy” place to go to these days, but it’s for good reason.  Between the Icelandic ponies, waterfalls, Northern Lights, and scenery that I didn’t even know existed on this earth, it makes for an epic place to visit. I’m going to share a handful of reasons to make a stopover in Iceland, although the images alone will probably convince you. When I found out many airlines, like WowAir , offer complimentary stopovers to Iceland from both the United States and Europe, I booked a flight ASAP (and at a great price). I chose to fly from Amsterdam to Washington D.C. then on the way back Washington D.C. to Reyaktvik and finally back to Amsterdam. Although it sounds like a lot of stops, it was well worth it to explore Iceland and see what the rave is all about. So, here are my top 5 reasons to make a stopover in Iceland – even just for 48 hours 1.)   The Scenery is uniquely amazing. Visiting Iceland was like being on an entirely different planet.   From waterfalls, lava rocks, glaciers, Northern Lights, ocean views, hot springs, and caves, Iceland has everything all on one small island. Simply getting off the plane to do a quick drive through the area is totally worth it.   You can see so much just by driving along the windy roads and taking in the views.   However, be warned that stopping on the side of the road is quite dangerous (too narrow) and highly discouraged, so make sure you take in the views safely and stop when allowed. Just in our short trip we were able to see the Northern Lights (outside our hotel room), visit one of the famous waterfalls, the coastline, and too many glaciers to count. 2.) Iceland is expensive, so a stopover is more economical. As much as I would have loved spending 7+ days exploring Iceland, it is a very expensive country.   Although you can find flights and a rental car at an economical price point, everything else like accommodation, excursions, food, and gas is quite pricey. We found that renting a car for two days and driving to see as much sites as possible was the best way to experience Iceland. Although there are plenty of things you could spend money on like skiing in the winter, visiting the infamous Blue Lagoon , and taking a caving excursion, we found so much joy just taking in the atmosphere around us and exploring on our own (plus, much cheaper). 3.) Ponies, ponies, and more ponies. I don’t know about you, but I am an animal lover.   And the fact that in every direction there are these majestic Icelandic ponies just waiting for you to pet them, was absolutely amazing to me.  Definitely becoming an icon or mascot of Iceland, these Icelandic ponies are so friendly and love the attention that the tourist give them.   It’s like a scene from a movie seeing them with their hair blowing in the wind and the mountains behind them.  It came to my surprise how neat it was seeing all of these ponies roaming the beautiful hills and playing with each other. It really is a sight to see in person. 4.) Relax in a natural hot spring. After flying overseas for 5+ hours nothing sounded better than soaking up the natural hot springs and watching the sunset. All over Iceland, you can find natural hot springs and many hotels have manmade springs on site. Although only having 48 hours in Iceland meant a busy schedule of seeing as much as possible in that short amount of time, it’s totally worth it to spend a few hours relaxing in a hot spring. I mean, you deserve it after all that travel! Plus, it’s quite rejuvenating before you head to the airport for your next leg. 5.) It’s a great way to break up your flight at no extra cost. Beyond the obvious reasons that Iceland is a magical place with so much to see and do, it’s also a great way to break up your flight in-between Europe and North America. I fly abroad often and typically my first day after being on a plane is full of jet lag and just trying to recover from being on a plane for 8+ hours.   When stopping in Iceland, you have the opportunity to acclimate and adjust a bit before your final destination. Stopping in Iceland made my final trip more enjoyable and worthwhile.  Next time I fly overseas, I will definitely be making another stopover!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/04/hbo-game-thrones-filming-locations-tourist-spots/,iceland,"15 Game of Thrones Filming Locations that You Can Visit It’s that time of the year again! You know that another Game of Thrones season has begun when your Facebook news feed is flooded with cheers of excitement, cries of anger, and death threats for friends who are posting spoilers. It is not difficult to understand why HBO’s highly entertaining and often wildly brutal adaptation of the George RR Martin novels has reached the legendary status in pop culture. It has all the right ingredients: compelling characters, convincing production, unpredictable plot twists, and the right amount of fantasy. And dragons! Put it all together and you get a weekly serving of wonder. Brutal at times, but still pretty mindblowing. But there’s one more thing that always captivates me about this phenomenal hit. On the Season 6 premiere, for instance, when the khalasar made their way to Khal Jhaqo with Daenerys Targaryen in tow, I was so drawn to the arid landscape that surrounded them that I googled it right away. Bardenas Reales in Spain, it turned out. I have been so fascinated with GoT’s choices of filming locations that I have come up with a mission: visit as many of them as I can. The first that I set foot on was Essaouira in Morocco, which was where all Astapor scenes were shot (including that part where Khaleesi freed the Unsullied and ordered them to kill their masters). And when I backpack across Europe later this year, I’m certainly making stops in Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Spain.       So I decided to make a list of the fictional places in the series and their real-life counterparts, where they were primarily filmed. But before we begin, some notes: This list covers exterior shots only. Many of the interior sequences were actually done elsewhere. For example, Dobrovnik’s streets and coastal walls are used mainly for King’s Landing, but interior shots (Red Keep, Iron Throne, etc.) are done in sets in Northern Ireland. This is not 1:1. King’s Landing may be filmed mainly in Dubrovnik, but they also took supplementary footage of Essaouira and Malta as the Westeros capital. Dubrovnik also stood in for the City of Qarth in Season 2. Many of these sites have been digitally modified or enhanced by the show. Winterfell, for example, is almost unrecognizable as Castle Ward. This is not complete. I will update this as the series moves forward. Now that we got the caveats out of the way, here it is: a Game of Thrones fan’s travel bucket list! WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland 9. Pentos: Malta 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia The ancient port city of Dubrovnik has seen a steady increase in tourism since they first used it to depict King’s Landing in Season 1. Executive Producer David Benioff said, “The first time we saw Dubrovnik, I was in shock, because the whole city really looked the way we pictured King’s Landing looking.” 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland Castle Ward tower digitally modified to create Winterfell The vast 1000-acre grounds surrounding Castle Ward has hosted the production team as they bring to life many of the series’ key moments, including scenes featuring Winterfell, seat of the House Stark and capital of the North. Much of the first 2 seasons took advantage of the sheer size of its grassy farmyard, perfect for army camp sequences, and ancient structures including Audley’s Castle. 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland The Magheramorne Quarry is an abandoned limestone quarry in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is where the Castle Black set was installed. (It has also been used as Hardhome and the city walls of King’s Landing in Season 2’s Blackwater episode.) It is currently not accessible to the public, but there are pending plans of reopening it as a mountain biking center. Fingers crossed. 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland Iceland as Wildling and White Walker territory Iceland in real life Most of the events north of the Wall of Westeros are realized in Iceland. This includes the glacier at Snæfellsjökull (I don’t even know how to pronounce that properly) which was used as the Fist of the First Men; Mývatn Lake, a frozen lava lake close to the town of Akureyri, which was where Mance Rayder’s wildling group dwelled; and Grjótagjá Cave, where Jon Snow and Ygritte had a very wet consummation of their love. 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain Alcázar of Seville as Sunspear in Dorne Alcázar of Seville in reality Dorne was actually what I was so excited to see on television. I just thought it had the most character. Dorne, the southernmost region of the Seven Kingdoms, in the books was actually inspired by medieval Spain, so it totally makes sense that they chose Seville as location, including Sunspear, seat of House Martell, which was actually the Alcázar of Seville in reality. This season, fans are also excited to see the Tower of Joy, which was said to be Castillo de Zafra, a 12th-century castle in Guadalajara. 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland Also known as “raised beach,” Ballintoy Harbor in County Antrim can take pride in being real-life Iron Islands. Images of this picturesque harbor were digitally enhanced to mimic the jaw-dropping seascape of Pyke and Lordsport. You remember that scene where Theon Greyjoy first meets his sister Yara? That was shot here. 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland Stannis Baratheon’s bailiwick is actually Downhill Strand, a beach destination in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It’s where Stannis and Melisandre set the Seven idols on fire and where Davos allowed Gendry to flee. 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland Kingsroad Do you remember when Arya, Yoren, Gendry, and Hot Pie were on the way to the Wall after escaping King’s Landing? Did you notice the beautiful avenue flanked with rows of eerie but beautiful trees? That’s the Dark Hedges of Armoy, which in the GoT world is Kingsroad. It is actually a road of beech trees, which according to Northern Ireland’s tourism website , were planted in the 18th century by the Stuart family “to impress visitors as they approached the entrance to their Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.” 9. Pentos: Malta See that arch in the background? That’s the Azure Window, a famous feature of the Maltese Island of Gozo. Azure Window IRL. And now we go all the way back to Season 1. The Mediterranean archipelago of Malta has been home to the GoT team for many days, too, mostly during the filming of Pentos. In particular, the 16th century Verdala Palace, the official summer residence of the Maltese President, stood in for the mansion of Illyrio Mopatis, the merchant-prince who sold Daenerys to Khal Drogo in marriage. The wedding feast then took place in Gozo Island, the second largest island in Malta. 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia Meereen, the largest city that Daenerys Targaryen has conquered and ruled so far, is the Croatian city of Split in real life. Situated on the coast of Dalmatia, this picturesque city faces the Adriatic Sea. Among the sites used in the series is the Diocletian’s Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site, whose cellars provided replacement for the underground passages in Meereen. 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia Šibenik, a quiet medieval town in Central Dalmatia, Croatia, made its GoT debut in Season 5 as the free city of Braavos, where Arya Stark found herself after sailing from Westeros and where the Iron Bank is located. 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco Essaouira as Astapor Essaouira in real life The port city of Essaouira along the Atlantic coast of Morocco serves as Astapor, one of the cities in Slaver’s Bay. Essaouira is where most scenes in Astapor was shot, including the unforgettable and iconic scene wherein Daenerys Targaryen bought and freed the Unsullied, and then ordered her dragons to attack. Dracarys! 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco Aït-Ben-Haddou as Yunkai Aït-Ben-Haddou IRL. Also in Morocco is the old city of Aït-Ben-Haddou, a fortified city on the edge of the great Sahara desert. It’s no stranger to movies as it has been the setting for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), and Prince of Persia (2010) among others. But in the GoT world, Aït-Ben-Haddou is Yunkai, aka Yellow City and one of the three great city-states in Slaver’s Bay. 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain Vaes Dothrak has yet to be featured, but rumor has it that the team tapped the exotic charms of Almeria, a city in Andalusia, Spain, for this. We’ll see in the coming episodes. 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Many places have been used to depict the many parts of Dothraki Sea, but in the Season 6 premiere, the place we casually refer to as “wherever the fuck Drogon dropped Daenerys” is Bardenas Reales, the 100,000-acre badlands in southeast Navarre, Spain. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,iceland,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/05/hilarious-backpacking-experiences-round-the-world/,india,"My 3 Most Ridiculous Moments While Backpacking RTW The Other Poor Travelers is a series where we feature other backpackers who inspire us not just with their ability to travel on a budget but also the tales and lessons they pick up along the way. In this edition, we give you S. Bedford, author of It’s Only the Himalayas and Other Tales of Miscalculation from an Overconfident Backpacker. When my best friend and I set out on a round-the-world trip, I expected what I thought to be the quintessential backpacker experiences. Being awed into humility before the rose gold hue of the Taj Mahal at sunset, for example. Or discovering tranquility in the Popsicle blue waves in Loh Dalam Bay. Or even “finding myself” in that ambiguous sense while gaping at the tremendous mountain-scape surrounding Annapurna Basecamp.       In fact, we spent more time dodging guys with one hand on their camera phones and the other on their trouser crotches than admiring India’s most celebrated tomb, and Koh Phi Phi’s Popsicle blue waves were undulating reminders of the way-too-many cocktails I’d imbibed the night before. As for what happened in the Nepali Himalayas… well, I didn’t so much find myself as I did have my ass handed to me. Here are three of the craziest, most unexpected moments that occurred during my year abroad. Lonely Planet didn’t warn me about any of this… At Taj Mahal WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Getting Chased by Lions in Zimbabwe 2. Starring in a Bollywood Commercial for Men’s Underwear 3. Battling My 2 Worst Enemies on a Mountaintop like a Japanese Cartoon Character Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Getting Chased by Lions in Zimbabwe The African jungle teems with an endless succession of fanged and clawed carnivores each more eager than the last to devour your face. There are baboons who’ll throw their poo before going for your eyes; elephants who’ll mash you into pulpy hash-browns; and hippos who’ll… drown you? Squish you? Admittedly, I’m not sure how something resembling a hybrid between a giant pig and an upturned bathtub can be one of the deadliest animals in Africa, but the mystery certainly adds to its formidableness. Africa There was one rule at the hostel outside Victoria Falls: do not leave the compound. I was completely prepared to adhere… until I discovered my bed was full of ants and was forced to bunk with our drunk-on-adrenaline-and-also-beer safari guide. After listening to incredible tales of adventure in the wilderness, I was finally seduced into sneaking out into the screeching, blood-lusting night to fodder my own story. Ten minutes later, I was surrounded by locked eyes and smacking chops, and found myself wondering: If I poo myself, should I throw it?   2. Starring in a Bollywood Commercial for Men’s Underwear Kerala, India I’ve never had the longing to become a famous actor, but I have always wanted to hang with beautiful men, even if they have abdominal lines by Cover Girl and the charming finesse of a durian fruit. Therefore, when I glimpsed a commercial being filmed while sunbathing on Varkala Beach in southern Kerala, I couldn’t resist saying hello to the actors clad in the tightest of whities. But not before I squeezed into my tiniest shorts and most uplifting bikini—hey, I needed something to set myself apart from their female costar, who resembled a sexy deer. Unfortunately, my plan worked a little too well. In addition to catching the eye of the paunch-bellied director who immediately cast me as “cheering white girl number two” (second to my best friend, whose cleavage is way better), I became the object of desire for the one actor who wasn’t also a model. Rather, he was the 40-year-old crispy-haired villain with the determination of Wayne Campbell from Wayne’s World. Anybody know the Hindi translation for, “She will be mine, oh yes, she will be mine”?   3. Battling My 2 Worst Enemies on a Mountaintop like a Japanese Cartoon Character There’s a Gary Larson comic depicting history’s paramount underestimations. It shows the cowboys at Little Big Horn saying, “Indians shmindians” and woolly mammoths saying, “Neanderthals shmeanderthals,” amongst others. Could I add a personal addendum, it’d feature yours truly with the constitution of a shelled mollusk dressed in lumpy jeans and old mittens scoffing at our trekking leader: “Himalayas shimalayas.” (Actually, the line was, “It’s only the Himalayas,” but I digress.) Annapurna Annapurna Basecamp with Dad My two greatest nemeses are cold weather and physical exercise—which you’d think would have dissuaded me from attempting one of the most notorious mountain treks on earth. But I’m also easily lured by notions of achievement (basking in it after the fact, that is, not actually doing it), which is why I undertook the daunting task despite zero training or proper gear. It must be a hereditary trait as my sexagenarian father who breaks a sweat crossing a parking lot accompanied me. Two brain-wrenching, gut-terrorizing, muscle-mincing, heart-rattling weeks later, I understood why the words “only” and “Himalayas” should never share a sentence. Of course, during my travels I likewise had many beautiful experiences that rendered me overwhelmed with gratitude for life—but who wants to read about that? Besides, it’s the awkward, embarrassing, crazy moments and how you handle them that shape you. Spoiler alert: I never did find myself. And thank goodness for that, because then I wouldn’t have a reason to do it all again someday. S.

"https://hippie-inheels.com/one-month-backpacking-india/,india,"One Month Backpacking India Dates in India:  8 November through 18 December Airline &amp; Booking site: one way flight from Yangon, Myanmar to Mumbai for $180 USD through Expedia. When leaving India, flew Goa to New Orleans for $600 one way (booked last minute) also booked on Expedia. What was your daily budget during one month in India? My daily budget was $30/day. Some days I was under, spending only $15/day , and other days I was WAYYY over. The splurges were mostly on food because, due to the currency crisis , we had to eat at places that accepted cards. This ended up being overpriced Indian food cafes or Western chain restaurants. Allison thought that the trail wallet app was useful because she has a tendency to go over her budget. She said that it kept her on track by having to enter in every single purchase. How did you book hotels and hostels while in India? We booked hostels via the Hostelworld app . I recommend booking through the hostel’s direct website because it ends up being a little cheaper as you are not being charged Hostelworld’s commission. “I don’t think booking ahead is necessary–we booked the day before we planned to arrive and that proved to be sufficient.” How did you book transportation in India? We booked our train tickets directly at the station. When we arrived at a new city, we went directly to the foreign ticket counter (or regular ticket counter if there was no foreign line) before even leaving the station to book our tickets to the next place. Our itinerary was basically at the mercy of which trains had seats available. Before reaching the ticket attendant, we would come up with a list of our top three places we wanted to go next and then we would book tickets to whichever place had available seats. We took 3rd AC class on all of our train rides and it was SO NICE! I was surprised to see how nice and comfortable the trains were. 3rd AC even has charging ports and the blankets were nice to have when it was colder.   Of course they tried Bhang lassi! and loved it! Do you have any tips about the trains and buses in India? Get an Indian sim card and download the Cleartrip app to use for booking. Use a mummy liner for sleeper buses. Drink the chai Request the top tier bed at booking because then you’ll be able to sleep in. Make friends with your seat mates, especially if they are a couple or family. They’ll look out for you. PS: if you don’t have a phone which is unlocked you cannot put in a SIM card. You need to purchase an unlocked phone. If you would rather,  Trabug   sends a phone to your initial hotel in India ready to go. Tell us your exact itinerary for one month in India (5 weeks) and the hostels you stayed at. 4 days in Mumbai at Bombay Backpackers 4 days in Udaipur at Bunkyard Hostel 4 days in Jaipur at Zostel Jaipur 3 days in Jaisalmer at Moustache Hostel 4 days in Amritsar at Jugaadus Eco Hostel 5 days in Delhi at Zostel Delhi 3 days in Agra at Zostel Agra 2 days in Varanasi at Zostel Varanasi (I went on a 5 day visa run to Kathmandu. We then flew from Kathmandu to Goa, via a 24 hour layover in Delhi where we splurged big time on a a stay the Pride Plaza Hotel.) 6 days in Goa at Prison Hostel How did you find the hostels in India? The hostels in India are really on the come up. The majority that we stayed in were clean, secure, well-located, and had spacious and comfy common rooms. I would say that they are on par with the hostels that one would see on the Southeast Asia backpacker trail, minus the alcohol buckets of course. Also, hot water isn’t always available. A lot of the hostels offer daily activities for guests to socialize. The Zostel in Jaipur even runs a pub crawl. A common theme among them was daily free chai and cookies around 5 PM. Drinking alcohol was not allowed in any of the hostels we stayed at (except in Goa), but it’s so easy to meet other backpackers and go elsewhere to get dinner and a drink. I noticed that a lot of the hostel employees were Indian backpackers who decided to stay put for a while before they continue traveling. We paid anywhere from $3-$8 USD/night. Hostel vibes tour with hostel crew  Of everywhere you traveled, which was your favorite place in India? It’s a tie between Udaipur and Amritsar. Udaipur is a favorite because, after Mumbai, it was great to be out a city and be in a place that really felt like India: intensely colorful, loud, delicious eats, etc. Our hostel there, Bunkyard Hostel , was run by a group of young, chill Indian guys and it was perfectly located right on the lake. Amritsar is a favorite because of the AMAZING hostel we stayed at, Jugaadus Eco Hostel . We went on the hostel tour to the Wagah border and also ate our faces off at the food tour. The night shift employee knew of a wedding going on in his village and was nice enough to invite us! Also, the Golden Temple at night is a magnificent sight and moving experience. “On a superficial level, Delhi is also one of my favorites due to the high amount of hot hipster Indian guys that populate the city. The Starbucks in Connaught Place seems to be their main stomping ground.” Which was your least favorite place in India and why? Jaisalmer. I found there was not much to do or see beyond the camel safari and the fort. I didn’t do the camel safari, but Allison did and highly recommends it. Is there somewhere in India you wish you had gone that isn’t on your list? Hampi, for sure. Kerala, too. We just ran out of time. Is there a place that you liked but think you should have spent less time? We could’ve spent less time in Mumbai. We had only planned to stay there for two days, but the demonetization announcement was made the night we landed. We had to stay in Mumbai until we had enough cash to book train tickets. Is there a special memory from India that you’ll always remember? At the wedding near Amritsar, there was a point where I was dancing on stage with both the wedding guests and friends from the hostel. I was just the right amount of tipsy, the music was great, and it was one of those perfect travel moments where everything comes together to create a moment where you don’t think you could ever love life as much as you do right then.  I felt thankful and proud of this life of travel I have built for myself. Did anything bad happen to you in India? Nope. How did you find the people there? Did you have issues with staring or harassment? I found Indians, especially the ones around my age, to be friendly and really wanting me to enjoy my time in their country. Some can be very, very shy so it may take a while for them to warm up. There was lots of staring but we got used to it after a while. We didn’t have any issues with harassment other than a truck full of men yelling at us as they drove by in Agra. What is the worst thing about traveling in India? Booking trains! It can be a real hassle because they book up so far in advance. If you’re on a tight timeline, I would suggest booking everything when you get to India because not being able to get the train you need can really throw off your itinerary. Also, if you have to go back to the station for tatkal, you have to pay for two extra rickshaw rides which add up. How does India compare to other places you have traveled? India is unlike any other place I’ve traveled to. It is loud, stinky, and dirty. But it is also stunningly beautiful, colorful, spiritual, and modern. I like the extremes. One day I was eating dirt cheap street food and haggling for a $2 bracelet in a several hundreds year old fort, and the next I was cruising around Delhi in a brand new Mercedes with my Tinder date. Anything can happen in India and I loved literally not knowing what each day would bring. Did you encounter any racism in India? While I was In Tanzania earlier on this trip, I had three other travelers tell me how racists Indians were. Before we went to the wedding, the hostel owner sat me down and told me that Indians are “extremely racist” and advised me to be prepared. I decided to go to India with an open mind so that I didn’t subconsciously close myself off. I never encountered any racism during my time in India or felt that I was treated differently than any other foreigner based on my race. Of course, there were some people who didn’t believe that I was American based on my skin color, but that has happened in almost every country I’ve traveled to in Asia. If anything, being a black girl with blue braids helped me to meet more people because they would come up to ask questions or ask for a picture and then we would get to talking. At the wedding, everyone was accepting of me and, if I can toot my own horn for a little bit, I was a hit! What do you wish you’d known before coming to India? We wish we would’ve known about the demonetization before we arrived so that we could have gotten some USD. We were both on planes when the announcement was made so we literally had no clue what was going on until we landed. We also wish that we knew how nice 3AC was so that we wouldn’t have wasted space in our packs with sleeping bags.   Is there anything you didn’t pack you needed? More long shirts and tunics that covered my bum. What that you DID pack ended up being really helpful on the trip? Headlamp for the times the power went out, wet wipes, and first aid kit. How did you like the food and what food do you recommend people try in India? The food, especially up North, was amazing! We were always looking forward to our next meal. My favorite dish was bhindi masala with garlic naan. Along with that, we recommend butter chicken, galub jamun, keer, jalebi, baati, and anything tandoori. Did you find the bathroom situation easy enough or was it a hassle? “The bathroom situation was easy enough. Do some squats before you leave to prepare your quads haha. Also, carry toilet paper or baby wipes in your purse because there will never be any.” Did you feel safe while in India and do you think the media makes it out to be worse than it is? I actually think that the media here doesn’t cover a lot of what goes on in India as it relates to crimes against women. As long as you keep your wits about you and follow female safety travel tips for India you should be okay. How did you feel about Goa’s party scene and Goa in general? I do not like trance music, and since most of Goa’s nightlife scene revolves around trance parties, a lot of our nights there were spent just drinking at whatever restaurant we had dinner at. We went to Lilliput one night to listen to reggae music, and that was a cool vibe. As a last India hoorah, we went to ladies night at Club Cubana. This place is great if you want to dance to rap/hip-hop and on Wednesdays, there is no cover for girls AND they can drink for free. I didn’t love the beach in Anjuna. It was a bit dirty and we felt like we couldn’t relax because the girls kept coming up to try to sell things to us. I heard that South Goa is more chilled, so maybe I will check that out next time. Do you think you’ll come back to India or was one time enough? As my family and best friend at home are probably tired of hearing, I am obsessed with India and will definitely be back and hopefully very soon! There is so, so much left to explore. I am so happy that the girls shared all their tips for India in this post! If you are considering coming to India, it’s important that you keep reading and learning about how to prepare for this trip. You’ll need a visa (there is NO visa on arrival here). You’ll also want travel insurance and start by reading these FAQ about India travel."https://hippie-inheels.com/goa-nightlife-most-popular-party-places/,india,"Epic Goa Nightlife: Most Popular Party Places in Goa Goa is literally notorious for its party scene , but it’s a very specific type of scene – one that I, being American, had no idea about since five years ago all I listened to was rap and country! I traveled around India and came to Goa last, and was like what is this “Psy”; is he a DJ? (lol, true story). But “Psy Trance” is the music of choice here in Goa, where it originated and the parties and raves here are unlike anywhere I’ve ever been. I’m going to share the most obvious hotspots for Goa nightlife now in case you want to try one of these epic popular party places in Goa . Keep in mind that even if it’s not your cup of tea, it’s truly something to check out at least once because these parties are 100% part of Goa and Goans, Indians from outside Goa, and foreigners come together at these – it’s not something fake for tourism. In fact, these parties are as real as it gets! The “trance” parties are mostly Anjuna and Vagator but also in Morjim, Ashwem, and Arambol. Since I am not out much, I asked my party girl friend Katja to let me borrow some of her images for this post. She’s the designer behind Dadablui  (who I wrote about in this post ) and has been partying at these places for decades- thanks, Katja! Goa Nightlife: Top 5 Popular Party Places in Goa 1. HillTop HillTop is definitely the most known and nostalgic place to check out a party here in Goa. Just check out their Facebook page to see images of the scene and you’ll get how wild it is! Sundays are the night they have their biggest parties starting early at like 5 pm until only 10 pm but some nights like NYE and Christmas Eve go on here until all through the next day. You’ll find backpackers, locals, old school Goa hippies who have been coming here for 30 years, and domestic Indian tourists altogether. It’s really not an “exclusive” vibe – people are welcoming and laid back at these things. If you don’t want to dance there are sometimes ladies with chai on the sides (“chai mamas”) and you can go sit and chill and people-watch. It does cost to get in! Most of the amazing trance parties here are a little expensive. The DJ’s here are not just some random people, they are internationally known amazing trance DJ’s and some people travel here just to see their favorites perform. It does cost to get in (anything from 500 to 2,000 rupees depending on the party). Most of the amazing trance parties here are a little expensive. The DJ’s here are not just some random people, they are internationally known amazing trance DJ’s and some people travel here just to see their favorites perform. HillTop is up on the big hill in Vagator before you turn to go toward the cliff (Thalassa, Antares, etc). It’s been around since 1976! 2. Shiva Valley Shiva Valley is on Anjuna Beach and is another really epic place for trance music and kind of one of the “original” places in Goa for this. It’s right next to Curlies and it’s a beach shack like Curlies, but smaller. On Tuesdays, they have their big party which everyone goes to. This starts around 5 pm and there is a cover charge. 3. Curlies Also on Anjuna Beach, Curlies is the more popular shack of the two side by side shacks (Curlies and Shiva Valley). I think Curlies is said to be the first ever beach shack in Anjuna Beach – but that could be a rumor! It’s been around for decades though. Curlies is actually a pretty chill place to hang out during the day, too, and the food isn’t bad. We take friends here sometimes. After 5 pm or around sunset it becomes more of a party place though and sometimes goes all through the night. Of all the places on this list, Curlies is actually a place I do go to party sometimes and it’s great that it’s open in the monsoon. The party night here in on  Thursdays and it’s free to come in. Keep in mind at all bars/clubs in Goa if you are a group of just men, you may be denied entrance. They try to keep the balanced men and women for safety and such. 4. 9 Bar 9 Bar is somewhere I tend to go really late at night after other parties have winded down. It’s a different type of place (on Vagator cliff) that has some outside parties but also this inside space which is a little dungeony since it’s soundproof. It’s definitely that real “trance” vibe though and a cool place to check out; they get DJ’s here from all over the world. It’s near a lot of hostels and guesthouses, so tourists tend to pop in here for parties. A perk of this place is you get amazing views over the Arabian Sea! Every time I’ve been it was free entry, but there are some big parties where they might be charging a small amount to enter, depending on the DJ. 5. Chronicle Chronicle is also on Vagator cliff but down the cliff a little bit. It has levels and has amazing views. Chronicle isn’t really known for trance/psy but has all kinds of electronic music like techno and deep-house. Chronicle is also a restaurant and has a shop inside, so I guess you could say it’s a little more upscale party place and you can get more dressed up here if you want to. It’s actually new since I moved here and opened in 2013. You can check their Facebook page to see when they are having a big party and they do charge an entrance fee on nights like that. So, which Goa nightlife hotspot will you add to your Goa bucket list? Those were the top five places to go for Trance, Psy, Techno parties (you can check their Facebook pages or WUG  to see what DJ will be there). This really just scratches the surface though; there are so many more places to have epic parties in Goa like Monkey Valley or new ones popping up in Morjim. This guide is mostly just to show you the most well-known, classic, trance parties in Goa. It’s definitely not my scene; although I’ve tried these parties a lot, I just don’t love this music. I honestly wish I did. I love how it brings people together and all my friends are into it, but all these years have gone by and I’ve never gotten into it (I think partly as I’m not much of a partier, in general, these days, so maybe when I was 20 I’d have loved it!). You also have the commercial scene here in Goa with R&amp;B, hip-hop, and Bollywood. This is mostly in Baga, Calangute, and Candolim at clubs like Sync, LPK, and on Tito’s Lane."https://hippie-inheels.com/sangti-valley/,india,"Secret Little Sangti Valley in NE India I’ve been traveling around India for three years, and after seeing so many places the thing I love to do most is going to places that I’ve never heard of… and neither have most people. Sangti Valley is 15 km outside Dirang, buried in the Eastern Himalayas, and another stop in Arunachal Pradesh tourism that many won’t see as it’s often overlooked. For me, while traveling with Holiday Scout , it was less about the town or area I was in and more about the interactions. While touring the backwaters of Kerala became famous for its beauty and now everyone goes, one day when Arunachal tourism picks up, Sangti Valley will be flooded by tourists. It’s one of the most stunning places I’ve been. I’m happy to have gone before that happens and suggest the same to you! What I mean really, is you can’t base a places worth on its popularity as there are still some secret places to visit in India even with its huge population. When you research about Arunachal Pradesh, you will most likely come across little bits about Sangti Valley, and previously written about Dirang, although both are so small that neither even have a Wikipedia page. The people here are Mahayana Buddhist Monpas with a culture similar to people in Bhutan. As you can see they grow corn! They hang it out to dry to get the seeds for the next season. There are also apple and kiwi farms . You can buy bags of Kiwis here for the same price one is in South India! Between here and Dirang there are also Hot Springs , although I didn’t go visit them. Holiday Scout does “bespoke” tours so if you wanted to see them you just have to ask. Sangti Valley is where the black neck crane comes each year. They breed here in the valley! It’s a rare bird that is only in India and Bhutan in the colder regions. It’s got a 7 foot wing span and it’s loved by Buddhists and a symbol in their religion. It also happens to be the state bird of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. We parked up on top and walked down into the valley. The area we parked at was a sheep farm. We got their just in time because after 10 minutes the man told Sange “It’s their bed time”.  The sun goes down early in NE India, before 6 PM so I guess they get them inside before it gets dark. The guy whistled a unique call and all the sheep came running. A few got a little confused and went the wrong way but they eventually figured it out! There are many of India’s North East places to visit that don’t have much information online which is why I decided to make posts about these places and not just do a quick mention. They deserve some attention, especially Sangti Valley!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/10/india-golden-triangle/,india,"Travel Goal: INDIA’s GOLDEN TRIANGLE History has repeatedly shown us that the best things always come in threes, from Hollywood blockbusters, stories and heroic teaming. The rule of three usually means things are more inherently humorous, satisfying and effective than any other number.  This is why many locations and tour operators around the world boasts of three stop or triangular tours. India is no stranger to this with its Golden Triangle Tour being world famous, taking in most of India’s most popular tourist sites. The trip begins in the heart of Chaotic and bustling Delhi, where one should expect things to be a little topsy-turvy. From there it’s on to one of the most iconic sites in the entire world, the Taj Mahal as you explore the city of Agra. Jaipur the Pink City is the last stop on your journey before your return to Delhi, with its many fascinating buildings ancient sites and modern day luxuries each city is sure to entertain. Each city being connected by railways and roads when looked at on a map forms the shape of a triangle, with its vast amounts of cultural heritage sites, loaded with history and the seat of India’s power, the route was given the name the golden triangle. Delhi being the capital of India one would expect lots of people crowded streets and many architectural eyesores. However the city also bleeds out of its urban madness into some sites that shows the heart of India. Start your morning off with a cup of Chai tea the perfect blend of spices and milk. While exploring the city, places like the Jama Masjid Mosque and the Lakshmi Narayan Temple in Old Delhi are not be missed, two places of religious worship beautiful constructed makes for the perfect places to take in the building styles of old India. For a breath of serenity take a visit to the Humayun’s Garden Tomb, a clean open air space where the incredible fusion of Persian and Nigel architecture makes up the inspiration for the Taj Mahal, Agra. The city of Agra takes center stage of the triangle because what is a trip to India without visiting the Taj Mahal? The traffic has to been to be believed, the streets are sometimes littered herds of goats, a few cows every now and again, scooters, cars and trucks. Over the years we have heard of many lovers doing the unthinkable for their lost love ones, from Cleopatra and Mark Anthony to Romeo and Juliette. But when Shah Jahan lost his wife he commissioned the building of the Taj Mahal as a monument to her beauty and a mausoleum.   The Agra Fort served as a stronghold for many Mughal empires, it even served as a prison for Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned there by his own son for 8 years before his death. Other sites include the Akbar Mausoleum who the father of Shah Jahan and one of India’s greatest rulers. Jaipur Jaipur the flamboyant Pink City was painted pink to welcome the Prince of Wales in 1867, home of the City Palace; the city still hosts its royal descendants today some of home can still be scene at the site. Built with its many honeycomb windows, the place was constructed so that the many royal females could watch the city’s festivities from above without having to mingle. The Amber fort with its sun kissed brown color in Rajasthan former home of the once rulers of India the Maharajas, the fort takes you back in time and leaves you there as you overlook the beautiful body of water next to the fort. Rajasthan former palaces have been transformed for many purposes, some of which being hotels and restaurants which provide all the flavors of India. With each region known for their own variants of dishes, all descending from the people that brought them from their home countries, such as the Mughals and their meat dishes and the Portuguese and their red chilies. Making India food one of the most assimilated around the world. After Jaipur you return to Delhi bringing your tour to an end with lots of new memories and possibly some wonderful trinkets to take back with you. Memphis Tours specializes in taking you to the best there is to offer without the hassle of having to plan it yourself so come and explore India."https://hippie-inheels.com/itanagar-market/,india,"Mini Guide to Itanagar &amp; unique look at market We were in Itanagar Arunachal Pradesh during our  Holiday Scout tour as the Arunachal Pradesh capital is a great stopover between the Tawang side of the state and heading into Ziro Valley or to the East. The roads don’t actually connect through the state across the North, as Arunachal Pradesh tourism is sort of new (but growing!), so you have to drive back to the main highway often. one of the many quiet kids (the child kid, and the goat kid!) I met on my travels Roadside Maggi was a staple and I didn’t mind one bit, in fact I bought some for the house back in Goa I like it so much! Hotels in Itanagar We stayed at the brand spankin’ new Pybss Hotel . After roughing it in the cold up in Tawang it was heaven to check in at this hotel which had a hot shower, a DOMINOS and Baskin Robins across the street, the softest beds, and real coffee instead of instant for breakfast. I would have been happy to stay another night. Out of 3 hotels in Itanagar on Tripadvisor this is #1. We did have to switch from our first room because the shower wasn’t working but all was well after that. The bottom level has a strange smell as well, so take an upper tier room. Getting to Itanagar It’s a 7 hour drive by car (or 12 hours by bus) from Guwahati where most people fly into, as it’s the “gateway to NE India”. There is no Itanagar airport, but there are some flights (not daily) to Lilabari in Assam which is just under 70 km away from Itanagar. There are helicopter services to Itanagar and all over Arunachal Pradesh but it’s often called the second Bermuda Triangle as so many helicopters crash or go missing. I don’t recommend taking one even though they are only about 3,000 Rs. some women we saw fishing on our way to Itanagar What to see in Itanagar There are a few things to see, but just to be clear this isn’t really a tourist attraction. It’s more a stopover point. There is a Gompa Buddhist Temple called Buddha Vihar which was consecrated by the Dalai Lama 14th.   A popular lake called  Ganga Lake also called Gekar Sinyi, the  Indira Gandhi Park which we only drove by. It’s a place for families to picnic and have weekend get-togethers surrounded by nature. The 15th century  Ita Fort which literally means Fort of Bricks.  Jawaharlal Nehru State Museum  which was sadly closed on a Sundays and Mondays! There is also the R ajiv Gandhi University Itanagar .    toilet situation  Itanagar Market I always think one of the best ways to find out about a place is to tour the local market and I was surprised by some of the things I found in this one! We wandered through and in the end the only thing I bought was a Dairy Milk candy bar – ha ha, but I did get some great photos. some creepy crawlies, all still alive those are rats on a stick guys! There was also mithun jerkey (kind of like yak)."https://hippie-inheels.com/best-indian-dishes-for-travelers/,india,"New to Indian Food? The Best Indian Food to Try While Traveling in India There is so much Indian food to try which varies from state to state that you will never get bored of it. I wanted to have other travel bloggers who are based in India or are Indian tell their favorite food in India so that you can look for them on menus and try all the best Indian dishes. People do worry about the food in India (I get a lot of emails about it), but there’s nothing to worry about. It’s not as spicy as you think and you don’t always get sick ! When I first came here it was just “green goo” and “red good” in my mind. I ordered palak paneer over and over. But, once I branched out while eating with locals, I realized I was missing some amazing food. Don’t make that mistake because food is the best in India so you should try it all. If you’re going to South India, check out my article about how food down there is different. You can also read up on my post for how to eat street food in India and not get sick. If you’re wondering if you are really going to be eating with your hands here, the answer is yes, and it’s the best! These are some favorites (3 from me) from some bloggers here in India so that you can try the best food. As you read my blog each destination I also share the food I tried there and photos, like this amazing set up in Mysore . Top Indian food you should try while traveling India Fish Thali I am going to share my favorite things first! In all coastal places, there will probably be some kind of fish or prawn thali. In Goa, I get this a lot! I love thalis in general because it’s a plate that has a little bit of everything: usually, a couple curries, pickle, bread, papad, rice, chutneys, and it will change from state to state. You can also go for “rava fry” seafood which is when the prawns, fish, or mussels are coated in semolina and some spice and fried. Malai Chicken Tikka I live for this meal! This is chicken (always leg meat, so tender) marinated in a creamy cheese sauce then cooked in a tandoor. I love to actually wrap this up with the curd salad into a cheese naan and have a wrap! It’s great when you don’t want something spicy (chicken tikka kebab) and want something almost a little like flavors you would eat in the West. Chili Pork Ribs and Pork Coorg Style (Pandi Curry) Okay, the last one from me is all about PORK. I love Pandi curry, which is a pork curry from Coorg. When I had it in Coorg, it was so spicy, but elsewhere it has never lived up to that. I love it at Gunpowder though (a restaurant in Goa) who also do chili pork ribs with similar flavours. Also pictured in this photo is from veg curry (coconut based, very South Indian), some Andrah Pradesh style prawns with fried onions, and do you see that flakey bread? Malabar paratha is THE BEST bread in the entire world and it a south Indian style of paratha (not healthy) that when you see it on a menu, you must order it. Gol Gappa / Pani Puri If there was the last wish I was asked for – my answer would be Gol Gappa without a doubt. Gol   Gappa or Pani Puri is the most ubiquitous street food in India. It is known by different names in different parts of the country like Pani Puri in Maharashtra, Puchka in Kolkata and Pani Batashe in Madhya Pradesh. In North India, we call Gol Gappe. Like a true representative of Indian diversity, It changes flavors with every city and town. In North, the filing is potato and chilled water flavored with mint, tamarind and various spices including mango in season. In South, it goes with mashed boiling hot green peas and in Kolkata just the flavored water. You can identify a Gol Gappa vendor when you see these fluff crunchy puris piled on top of each other next to spiced water container. The Puri is picked up one by one filled with stuffing and then water is added before serving it on your plate. You can customize the taste on the go. To have the real taste of  Gol   Gappa  – you must eat it at a street vendor. Upmarket places have just not managed to replicate the taste of India’s best-loved street food. Let me assure you-you can never have just one  Gol   Gappa . -Anuradha, Inditales Sarson Ka Saag and Makki Ki Roti As much as I truly love Indian food – and the spicier the better! – I don’t really consider myself a foodie. Except for one dish: the Punjabi classic sarson ka saag and makki ki roti. There is something about the fragrance, taste, and heartiness of this meal that gets me salivating in seconds. The saag is made from mustard greens, cooked with spices and ghee, and the roti is made from makki, corn flour, and yes, also slathered with ghee. It’s also often served with chunks of gur, which is basically just jaggery and very sweet. This is not a dish for the diet conscious! Mostly eaten in North India in winter, when the mustard greens are harvested and people feel the need for warming and hearty foods, it’s almost a rite of passage in Delhi. Dilli ki sardi (Delhi in winter) would not be the same without it. You can get it in just about every Punjabi restaurant in winter, and probably most Punjabi dhabas (roadside stalls), too. Of course, like most Indian food, if you can get sarson ka saag and makki ki roti in a Punjabi family home, that will be the best of all. Along with being tasty and filling, there’s another great thing about sarson ka saag and makki ki roti: it’s naturally gluten free if the roti is made from pure corn flour, or corn flour mixed with another non-gluten containing flour like besan (chickpea flour) or lentil flour. Mariellen, Breathe Dream Go Kochuri-Aloor Dum Kochuri-Aloor Dum food is one of the most sought-after, authentic street foods in Calcutta. This is also known as ‘Kachori’ in other parts of India, particularly the Hindi speaking states. The hot, piping, fluffy Kochuri which is essentially made with flour and has a couple of variants. You would find this with stuffed peas and without it. The Kochuri with stuffed peas brings out the essence of the recipe and takes it to an ultimate gastronomical delight. The Aloor Dum is rich, hot, spicy (well, not that spicy after all), juicy and tangy potatoes with a thick gravy that accentuates the taste of the dry Kochuri. When the two comes together, it’s an explosion inside your mouth. It’s a common sight in quite every neighborhood of Kolkata. Long queues of office goers grabbing a plateful of their favorite Kochuri and Aloor Dum during the morning hours of the day – weekdays or weekends. It is a magical foodies delight. And the best part of this ultimate foodie experience – it’s way too cheap for a quick bite that fills up your belly till you have the next full meal. Most eateries of Kolkata will sell this inimitable dish within a price range of Rs. 20 – 40 for a piece of Rs. 5 for each Kochuri. The Aloor-Dum gravy comes complimentary with the Kochuri. That’s easy on the pocket. Isn’t it?  -Amit, Black Board Jalebi There are sweets and then there is  Jalebi  the quintessential desi mithai that represent the deliciously functioning anarchy called India. No stenciled perfectly cut square like Barfee for Jalebi, and no sir every Jalebi has a mind of its own and flows freely to form her own shape and style. You may love Rosgulla for all its juices but it has been canned, It is the Jalebi that remains 100 % desi at heart and soul and you need to walk up to the tiny shops in the old part of cities like Delhi, Amritsar, Jaipur, Varanasi and Hyderabad  to get piping hot fresh from her dip in simmering desi ghee followed by a lazy rendezvous with thick sugar syrup that gives her the finger licking awesomeness. Forget fork and knife you are not even allowed to use a spoon to enjoy a jalebi. If you want to enjoy a Jalebi desi style roll up your sleeves, pick up the one you fancy from the just filled plate by the Halwai and quickly take it to your mouth. You will miss on the taste if you let it get cold by even one degree, for a jalebi is like an affair best enjoyed steaming hot, you know you are sinning but you want more and more and more. And let me warn you no matter how careful you are just like your affair a Jalebi will leave tell-tale signs on your clothes and on your palette.  Go ahead visit the smallest hole in the wall shop in Chandni Chowk in Delhi or the Jalebi Chowk in Amritsar to get the best Jalebis in town, enjoy and send me a thank you note for you have just enjoyed the queen of dessert that only true Indophiles can enjoy. – Prasad Np, desi Traveler Parsi Bun Maska My favorite ‘Indian classic’ food is Parsi Bun Maska. Although it’s a simple breakfast dish with a bun and butter, it’s special for the feeling it evokes. There’s a kind of Iranian fun and off-the-cuff attitude that comes along with their dishes, which is interesting to taste and savor. Bun Maskas are served in Irani cafes in Mumbai and also in various places in South Asia. Irani cafes were originally started by Zoroastrian Irani immigrants to India and Pakistan in the 19th century. In the present age, Hyderabad has the maximum number of Irani cafés, which are renowned for Irani chai. So, if you ever happen to visit an Irani café or a restaurant, make sure you ask for a ‘Bun Maska’ with a cup of Irani chai. It’s not just a good breakfast option, but you can have it anytime of the day – late afternoon or in the evening while you hang out with your friends.It’s a great way to soak in the Parsi way of life because it’s their typical style of having bread with butter. To try a Parsi breakfast or any of their authentic dishes, you can visit Kayani Bakery in South Mumbai. – Renuka, Voyager for Life Mirchi ke Pakode and Dry Fruits Samosa These two snacks are basically two different items and largely available in Rajasthan. They are to be consumed at tea time or as cocktail or bar snacks, with or without chutney. There is an undeniable relationship of their consumption to monsoon season. Mirchi ke Pakode: Pakoda (plural pakode) is a generic Indian name for the many types of fritters. These may be sliced, diced vegetables or mashed vegetables, breaded using a batter made of chickpea flour. Mirchi, here, is a large sized green pepper (Chilli) which is stuffed with spicy mashed potatoes. This is then breaded and deep-fried for a mouth-watering and probably eye-watering (for some) snack. These are generally available in roadside stalls and many of the restaurants throughout Rajasthan. Dry Fruit Samosa: Samosas are generally made with mashed potatoes and sometimes cooked vegetables are added to it, which are filled into a triangular shell of rolled dough and fried. Dry fruit samosas are different because they are smaller in size and the major ingredients of the filling are cashews, almonds and sometimes raisins. Although it goes by the same name, dry fruit samosa is never found on street carts or snack shops. In fact, these are generally served as cocktail snacks in parties and are also available in sealed packs in stores. You also get baked samosa if you want to check on your calories. Nisha, Lemonicks Pav Bhaji  Mumbai like most of India is an onslaught to your sense. If you find the sights and sounds overwhelming, you’ll find comfort in the food. Mumbai proudly boasts of a popular street food culture that is largely vegetarian in nature. All worth indulging in, but I find that there’s one dish that in my opinion represents the real essence of Mumbai style food and that is Pav Bhaji. It literally translates to Bread ( pav ) and Vegetables ( bhaji) , this is a concoction of cooked vegetables, (mainly boiled potatoes, peas, carrots, capsicum, ) and spices mashed down to an almost watery pulpy consistency with generous dollops of butter along with a toasted pav. Served with a garnish of freshly cut coriander, chopped onions, a squeeze of lime and another dollop of butter for good measure. This calorific dish is hearty and substantial since it was invented by Mill workers in the late 1800’s. It was meant to be a poor man’s dish that would keep them full during grueling work hours in Mumbai once flourishing Cotton mills. The addition of excess butter was not in the original recipe but over the years Mumbaikars have learnt to relish it and the more buttery, the better. You can find this on any street , at Juhu Beach or Girgaum Chowpatty Beach but if you’re skeptical to eat off the road, most hotels or restaurants serving Indian food have it on their menu. – Roxy, Tiny Taster Dal Batti Dall baati choorma is the traditional dish from the state of Rajasthan. It is essentially a lentil curry (mixture of dalls) and wheat flour balls baked by burying into burning embers. There are two different types of baatis as well – steamed and fried and all three are served at festivals. Choorma is a sweet dish that is made by smashing the baati and mixing it with ghee, ground sugar and almonds. Among other accompaniments to the dall baati choorma (Rajasthani Thali) is gatte ki subzi (ground bengal gram vegetable), and a fiery-red garlic chutney. The more elaborate and authentic thalis also have a smattering of kair and sangri (desert plants and beans). The dish is eaten by mixing the baati with ghee and dall. Dall Baati Choorma is available across the entire state of Rajasthan as it is the staple food of the masses. Every region has a different flavour though and the dhabas of Jodhpur are popular. One can sample dall baati choorma at eateries located near the railway stations and bus stands in Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Udaipur, Bundi etc. Among the top recommended places for the best dall baati choorma in Rajasthan are the dhabas at Mangalwad Chouraha near Chittorgarh. -Shubham, Travel Shoe Bum Missal Pao This Maharashtrian staple looks brown and watery until it is plated. That’s when it comes into its own – after being topped with generous handfuls of besan chivda, chopped onions, coriander and a dash of lemon juice. The gravy consists of pulses and sprouts which makes for a healthy base. It’s another matter altogether that they are cooked in enough red chilli powder to last a British family an entire year! Just kidding, although spicy, missal pao is our favourite quick meal while travelling anywhere around Mumbai. It’s available almost everywhere and Puneri missal is in a league of its own. While studying there for two years, Ankita tried it at numerous places but the most authentic one was served at the little shanty at the back of her college, FLAME Institute of Communication. The missal at small tapris comes closest to the ones cooked by Marathi women in their own homes. All that awesomeness is mopped up with plain pav. Unlike pav bhaji, here the pav is rarely roasted or buttered unless you ask for it. If you ask us, the softness helps appreciate the missal better. A healthier and kinder version of this dish is usal, which can also be had as a side dish with lunch or dinner. We love the missal served at Kamat restaurants across the state as well. In Panchgani, one of those came to our rescue when we were seeking a late lunch, having lost all track of time in our sight-seeing. – Ankita and Mohit, Trail Stained Fingers Tunday Kebab If you like stories, here’s one about the legendary Tunday kebab Lucknow. Once a Nwab wanted to eat his favourite kebab but had no teeth left anymore. To satisfy his royal cravings, a new kebab was invented which was so soft that it would melt in your mouth – and that’s the birth of the Tunday kebab. Made only in the erstwhile city of Lucknow, the most famous Tunday kebab is Galawati Kebab which basically comes from the term ‘gala’ or soft. The recipe uses papaya as a softening agent and also includes about 150 different ingredients in it’s preparation. It’s also a popular kebab with many Bollywood personalities who have been patrons of the food here for decades, including Dilip Kumar and Shahrukh Khan. The recipe of the kebab is a closely guarded family secret, and even the cooks who make it everyday don’t know anything more than the basic ingredients. The kebab is simple in taste and beautifully retains the original taste of meat and is best served with Sheermal paratha (saffron bread with a but of saffron) and sprinkled with lemon juice. The best way to complete a meal of kebab would be to top it up with steaming hot gulab jamuns – the quintessential north Indian sweet made in a shop right opposite the one which makes the kebab. -Sid, Sid the Wanderer Idlis, Dosais, and Vadais There are many Indias in India and you can see this diversity in food. Think South Indian cuisine and the most common food is a plate of idly and vadai or masala or plain dosai. This is the staple breakfast of every South Indian in the country, irrespective of which state he comes from. They are however synonymous with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka . The idli is perhaps the healthiest as its a steamed preparation of batter which includes rice and lentils that has been fermented overnight. The softer, fluffier and tender the idli, the more delicious it is. Dosai looks like a pancake and is made with a similar variety of batter . However it is not steamed but cooked with oil on a hot plate. It is served plain or with a spicy curry of potato and onion.  Vadai , shaped like a doughnut adds variety to the breakfast. Prepared with lentils , it is deep fried and is served crisp and hot. All the dishes are served with chutney and sambar, a spicy curry made with lentils and tamarind paste and spices. Although the trio is synonymous with South India, you can get it anywhere in the country today but the preparation may not be very authentic.  They are ideally served for breakfast but you can have them any time of the day. -Lakshmi, Lakshmi Sharath Chhole-Bhature  If there is one go-to breakfast, lunch or dinner the Punjabis in North India have, chhole-bhature it is. Chhole-Bhature (pronounced CHHO-LAY BH-TOO-RAY) is a two-part combo, served with chopped onions and pickles. While ‘chhole’ is a white gram curry preparation, Bhatura (plural: Bhature) is deep-fried bread made with the dough of Maida – also called all-purpose flour, Maida is bran-free flour that is refined and bleached. Chhole are a semi-gravy preparation that is the mandated ‘side’ for the bread called Bhature. The white gram are boiled, allowed to simmer on slow fire with spices and basically cooked till its aroma is good enough to entice you from reasonably far away. While chhole are prepared in advance, bhature are deep fried till they are a perfect shade of golden-brown, fresh on order. This dish is normally available in any eatery that serves Punjabi food. While you could order chhole-bhature anywhere, and while I could share some interesting places where you may try them, I am a believer of teaching you how to fish, rather than giving you a fish. That would suitably arm you to wade the convoluted and complex world of Indian Eateries and help you land a tasty meal on your table. So, for that, here are the tips: Look around to see if others around are also ordering chhole-bhature in that eatery. Check if they make fresh bhature. Ask if they serve chopped onions. Find out if they have mixed vegetable pickle. If it is a Yay for all of the above, go ahead and take the plunge! Once the dish is served, depending on your personal liking, break a piece of bhatura (the Maida bread), add a bit of pickle to it, ladle up some chhole on to it and pop it in your the mouth. Soon as you do that, shove some chopped onions also into your mouth. And then, allow the tastes and textures to burst forth – the spicy yet tasty chhole, the sour pickles, the crunch of raw onions and the crispy-soft texture of the bhatura. Then on, don’t stop. Just go on. A word of caution: It is a calorifically rich dish. No matter how strongly you are urged by the sins of greed and gluttony, exercise moderation. For some not used to spicy food, the morning after is the time for retribution, as some other orifice will pay back for the sins of the orifice called ‘mouth’. -Ajay, the Travelure Pin these best Indian dishes for later: Related Join my email list and get exclusive updates &amp; news straight to your inbox.  I will never give away, trade or sell your email address.

I absolutely adore Indian food and very much looking forward to getting some, come the summer. I do have to take caution though as I’m allergic to all nuts, and I don’t actually like spicy food! I know! I don’t know how I navigate it sometimes! Anyhoo! My favourite India food is chhole-bhature. Because of the bread. And I absolutely love thalis! The first time I had a thali was because I saw those metal lunch boxes and lots of people going into a “shop.” So I followed them! I got the real Indian authentic experience as nobody spoke English, so I just pointed at someone else, and they gave me a metal plate with all the stuff. And no cutlery! I didn’t know what to do, but looked around and did what everybody else was doing, although I had some problems with the sauces…! Ha! Ha! I doubt my German hubby would be interested in following anyone anywhere, but we are efinitely going to indulge in street food! I find it’s easier for my nut allergy as I can actually see what’s in my meal rather than trusting in the kitchens. You won’t believe how many times, I’ve been to fancy places in Asia, requested “absolutely no nuts” and my meal is slathered with peanuts or coconuts!!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-mumbai/,india,"What makes Mumbai a perfect destination for travelers seeking glamorous travel? Mumbai is the financial capital of India, home to Bollywood, the country’s glam film industry and houses some of the world’s most expensive real estate (which explains why accommodation is so pricey) and travellers with cash to splash will love it. While it isn’t big on ‘sights’ though it has some beautiful buildings , it’s got a great pulse, and offers hip dining options, swanky shops and it’s brimming with art and culture. Gateway of India What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? No hotel is more impressive than the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Colaba. Inside the gorgeous building are sea facing rooms, crystal chandeliers, grand ballrooms, great restaurants and impeccable service. It has hosted some of history’s most well known figures (Gandhi, The Beatles, Barack and Michelle Obama!) and epitomizes old world decadence. If you aren’t staying, spoil yourself by stopping by for high tea at Sea Lounge. In addition to finger sandwiches and little pastries, they have classic Indian street foods in perfectly petite portions. Abode Hotel What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Abode Boutique Hotel  is a real gem. It opened a year ago and has only received rave reviews. They have superior luxury rooms with clawfoot bathtubs all the way to cosy basic rooms with shared toilets for those on a budget. Abode is dripping with charm and has beautiful heritage tiled floors, art deco furnishings, a great library, a lovely cafe. It’s the little details. I couldn’t recommend it more. Where are the best hang outs during the day? My favourite spots to work are Cafe Zoe in Lower Parel, and Birdsong Cafe and The Bagel Shop in Bandra. They are lovely light-filled spaces with creative energy, delicious food and locals and expats in somewhat equal measure. Mumbai’s weather and lack of public spaces are a make outdoor activities a little bit tough but Mumbai has quite a few museums and contemporary art galleries to while away the day. Pick up the Mumbai Art Map for free at any of these locations and research what’s on before you go. If design and heritage mean luxury to you, try and catch a movie at one of Mumbai’s art deco cinemas. Choose from single screens like Regal and Eros, or my personal favourite, the elegant Liberty Theatre! Eros If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Mumbai and what are their best dishes? For sophisticated fine dining, I adore The Table (Apollo Bunder Marg, Colaba). They keep things fresh and simple and I like getting a selection of their small plates. Their salads are exceptional and you should try the boneless chicken ‘wings’ and zucchini ‘spaghetti’ which have become their signature dishes. Neel at Tote on the Turf (Racecourse, Mahalaxmi) makes delectable Indian food. You can’t go wrong with their kebabs, shorba and biryani with gucchi or morel mushrooms! I also really enjoy Pali Village Cafe (Ambedkar Road, Bandra) for the ambience. The charming balcony is perfect for a date and I’m hella partial to the risotto and panna cotta. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? You are talking to the right girl! The vibrant little neighbourhood of Kala Ghoda is my jam! Nobody does fine French patisserie like La Folie in Ropewalk Lane. You must try the gulkand (a sweet Indian rose petal preserve) macaron and the exquisite desserts. Far more rustic and equally delicious are the cakes at Kala Ghoda Cafe right opposite – the chocolate cake is as good as the carrot cake is as good as the sticky ginger! If you’re in Bandra, make a pitstop at Le 15 Patisserie and pack boxes of their wonderful choux and cupcakes! A special shoutout goes out to Indigo Deli for its icecream sundaes, and Ellipsis for chef Kelvin Cheung’s inventive desserts. How else can I get a dose of culture in the city? There’s always something going on in Mumbai from classical ballet to stand up comedy! For English theatre, check out the listings for NCPA and Prithvi Theatre (the latter has a lovely, relaxed outdoor cafe to enjoy a cup of tea or Irish coffee before the show) and to catch live music, the Blue Frog is the city’s go-to music venue. Check ticketing site bookmyshow.com for what’s on and where! Kulture Shop Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? Bungalow 8 is my favourite store in the city, a beautifully curated multi-level concept store that stocks great clothes, in addition to interior and lifestyle products. Their in-house fashion label The Bungalow by Matthieu Gugumus Leguillon is super chic! Bombay Electric is fresh and edgy and carries many fantastic local designers! One of my favourite labels is Obataimu which makes bespoke clothing for men and women and has a beautiful shop in Kala Ghoda. It’s spendy because everything is made to order and the textiles are so wonderfully lush. And for the perfect button down shirt, dudes should head to the Bombay Shirt Company just a few doors down. For beautiful Indian clothes, drop into Ensemble and Sabyasachi, both temples of designer desi garb and for what the rest of the world calls resortwear, I love Ahilaya. If you’re looking for cool souvenirs, check out Kulture Shop for tees and prints by Indian graphic artists as well as design store Filter which stocks great stationery, maps, mags and other trinkets. Lastly for great homeware and decor items, check out Good Earth and Freedom Tree. Bombay Shirt Company What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Mumbai? I haven’t been myself but I have it on good authority that people love the Four Seasons spa and the L’Occitane spa Love of Spa. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? If this means drinks, I head to Aer atop The Four Seasons in Worli. Mumbai’s magic hour is sublime and sunset happy hour runs from 530pm to 8pm so it can’t be beat for a glass of bubbly and panoramic views of the city and the sea. View from Aer Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Some of the most popular pre-gaming spots in Mumbai are the members-only sports and social clubs. If you have a local friend with the hookup, head to one of these for drinks. They’re great places to socialise and pack in lots of old world charm plus the drinks are always very affordable. My favourites are Royal Bombay Yacht Club, Willingdon Club and Otter’s Club. Alternatively check out the wildly popular Colaba Social, or The Daily in Bandra, which are currently local favourites. If you’re feeling fancy, head to Dome at the InterContinental for a glimpse of the glittering Queen’s Necklace, a nickname given to glittering Marine Drive when viewed from an elevated place at night. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Personally I think Mumbai’s clubs are highly overrated. However, many high-end restaurants across the city turn into party venues and the people are generally beautiful and interesting, the music is dance worthy and the gender ratio is good. I like bar nights at Olive, and Pali Bhavan in Bandra."https://hippie-inheels.com/guide-to-mysore/,india,"7 Must-Do’s in Mysore | Guide to Mysore After spending about 10 days in and around Mysore with a tour guide, I sure as hell better be able to give you some kind of guide to Mysore city!

Actually, I’ve learned so much if I don’t share it all with you, my head might explode. 7 Must Do’s in Mysore  1. Chamundi Hills The holy grail of Mysore, you CANNOT visit the city without stopping here. It would almost be sacrilegious. This is sacred land for Mysorians and Hindus in general. Why might you ask? Well, that’s a story for another day… but let’s just say Parvati got 10 arms and defeated a monster = Dashara and Chumundi hills being a huge deal. Here is the full story of Chamundi Hills . 2. Ayurveda at IVAC Although for Indians, Mysore is known for being royal, Mysore is known for four things to tourists: silk, incense, yoga, and Ayurveda. Although there are many places to get your Ayurveda on, I decided to spend 3 nights and 4 days at the famous Indus Valley Ayurvedic Center. I have a full review on it coming up, but overall it was fabulous. I didn’t have the cash dollas to do all the treatments recommended, but if you are rolling in the money there is no better place to spend it than with oil or ghee dripping on you at IVAC. 3. Market Tour &amp; Artisan Tour Mysore market is the most organized market I’ve ever been through in India. The veggies were piled in perfect squares, the flowers were all in one place and the walkways were huge. This is where you can buy all your perfumes (like Calvin Klein did and bottled it up!), incense, sandalwood oil, and yes… even silk! Be ready to spend a pretty penny. Save time to see the Msyore artisans that are hiding out in the alleys making all the goodies. I couldn’t have found them without goMowgli and am so thankful to them for sharing the information with me! 4. Try South Indian Food Eating in Mysore is going to take up a lot of your time. South Indian food is way different from the north where many tourists hang out, and it’s a far cry from Goan food. You’ll get to try tamarind rice, end each meal with curd rice (not my fave), and eat your thalis on banana leafs. There are some cafes in Mysore that serve western food, but it’s not as sophisticated as other more touristy cities, so it’s best to stick to South Indian fare in Mysore. Dosas with sambar and chutney for breakfast and some Mysore pak for a snack in the market… wash it all down with almond milk! (for more on food, check out the best restaurants in Mysore ). 5. Mysore Palace This should be the first thing you do in Mysore, unless it’s a weekend in which case do anything OTHER than the palace tour. Saturday was packed full, especially because it was a holiday while I was there. Mysore was a place of royals and up until a month of so ago had a king of it’s own (but he’s passed away with no heir thanks to the Mysore Cure in Talakad . all these people pictured have been caught pick-pocketing at the Palace The Brits kind of changed everything up when they came to Mysore. The palace was stunning though. I did the audio guide, but actually goMowgli had taught me so much already over coffee and travels that I didn’t need the guide. 6. Folklore museum This tiny little museum was very cute to talk through. In an old palace, it has the most random items from stethoscopes, to boats, and puppets. Strange, but more exciting than most museums. I couldn’t take photos in here and actually you’ll need to leave your camera and camera phone at the main desk or don’t bring it at all. 7. Brunch at Green Hotel   I stayed at the Green Hotel (which was once a palace built for 3 princesses) because it came highly recommended.  People come here for lunch and to just hang and meet friends in the gardens. They’ve had farmers markets and vendor booths set up. A great place to spend the afternoon and the food was super."https://hippie-inheels.com/bangalore-local-food-guide/,india,"Ultimate Bangalore Local Food Guide From A Local Bangalore, the capital city of Karnataka is my second home, a place where I live when I’m not traveling. I moved to this metropolitan city for work 7 years ago from Mysore , the city that I grew up and have ever since grown fond of this amazing city. I want to share with you my personal Bangalore local food guide. Being a foodie, I venture out looking for places to savor my taste buds with exotic food now and then. And yes, now I have a list of my favorite places for almost each kind of cuisine, and depending on my cravings, I keep going for some binge eating! In this post, I’m sharing some of the best restaurants for savoring authentic Karnataka’s delicacies, plus two other unique places for desserts (bonus!). All of these serve only vegetarian food, which is of course very hygienic! I have listed these places in the order of the oldest to the recently opened places. Bangalore Local Food Guide 01 | CTR Shree Sagar, popularly known as CTR, is one of the oldest restaurants in Bangalore. Started in 1920’s, CTR is one of the best places for a scrumptious breakfast in the old Bangalore area. It’s a simple place serving delicious food. It is heavily crowded for the most part of the time, so make sure to get through the traffic and make it on time. Keep in mind the time to commute plus wait time. Yeah, it’s worth everything, because you’ll end loving the food here! Must try: Benne (meaning Butter in the local language, Kannada) Masala Dose, Mangalore Bajji and Filter Coffee.

Timings: Open on all days. 7:30 AM – 12:30 PM, 4 PM – 9PM. 02 | Vidyarthi Bhavan Source Established in 1943, Vidyarthi Bhavan is another place in old Bangalore that has been serving excellent breakfast dishes to its lakhs of regular customers! Vidyarthi in the local language means a student, and back then it was a popular hangout place for the student folks. The restaurant has a website where you can see old photographs and some interesting facts about Bangalore. Check here . It’s a small place and it’s super crowded almost all the time (especially the weekends). You have to plan ahead to score your table and food here, and again, you’ll forget the pain once you taste the food here! Must try: Dose – Masala/ Saagu/ Plain, Rava Vade and Filter Coffee.

The place is very simple and small and there is no seating. In fact, it can be hard to find the place. The food is simply awesome here. The only other place to compete with the soft Idlis of Veena Food Store is Brahmin’s Coffee Bar! Must try: Idly-Vade served with amazing chutney, Bisibele Bath, Shavige Bath.

Sun: 6:30 AM – 12 PM. 04 | Brahmin’s Coffee Bar Source Brahmin’s Coffee Bar is another delight of Old Bangalore. This simple food joint is one of the few places in Bangalore that serves super food at very cheap prices. The soft Idlis just melt in your mouth and I’m sure, you’ll come back for the Vadas! Must try: Idly topped with butter served with the delicious coconut chutney, Crispy Vade and Filter Coffee. Others: Kharabath and Kesaribath. Where: Near Shankar Math, Shankarpuram, Basavanagudi. Timings: Closed on Sundays. 6 AM – 12 PM, 3 PM – 7 PM. 05 | Kamat, Bugle Rock Source Kamat is a household name amongst people who love the northern Karnataka’s cuisine. The restaurant has a few branches in Bangalore, and the one at Bugle rock is quite famous. The place also organises traditional performance on the weekends sometimes. The meals that you buy is unlimited, which is served traditionally on a plantation leaf, letting you enjoy the finger food. You get to try huge portions of a variety of dishes including the soft Jowar Rotis, rasam – a traditional sambhar delicacy of Karnataka, and a lot of vegetable curries.

The ambiance is modern and simple. There is so seating available and the place gets crowded in the evenings. South Thindies is known for their signature dishes, and if you want to try some cuisines of Karnataka apart from the Idly and the Masala Dose, you should definitely visit this place. My favorite is Halbai, the sweet dish, which is hard to find elsewhere in Bangalore (a good one, I mean!). Must try: Akki Rotti, Ragi Rotti, Bisibele Bath, Butter Masala Dose, Vade, Pesarattu Dose and Filter Coffee Others: Halbai (a sweet dish), Shavige bath, Kharabath and Kesaribath. Where: Basavanagudi. Timings: Open on all days. 6 AM –3:30 PM, 4:30 PM –10:30 PM For Drooling Desserts 07 | Cool Joint Bangalore being the cosmopolitan city, it’s not short of cool cafes and dessert places. So I’m including Cool Joint because it is a class apart for two reasons – It’s a place that has been serving amazing food and beverages well before the city became home to the modern cafes. The other being surprisingly low prices and the totally simple ambience, albeit any fancy decor. Needless to say, it’s packed in the evenings and on the weekends.

India has amazing food, friendly people, unique culture… and fabulous shopping! There are so many things to buy in India. This is a peak at what to buy in India and which are the best souvenirs in India based on region. There are uncountable markets to explore and you can even pick out your own fabric and get a dress or shirt made perfect for you at costs you won’t believe. Shopping in India I haven’t seen all of India, but I’ve been around (haha, over 4 years!).  I’m going to share the “it” things to buy in India: each area and/or state of India but admit it isn’t even close to the amount of things that are specific to each area- I couldn’t possibly go into that much detail. If you have a place you want to know about just email me and I might have been to that city and be able to tell you the best souvenirs. Remember when you shop to HAGGLE! They will quote prices sometimes, I kid you not, 100x more than the value. The rule of thumb is to offer back 1/4 of what they say and go from there. Here is a whole article on how to haggle in India . Do not let your rickshaw driver take you to any shops. He’s just trying to make commission and force sales on you. Be firm. People will call “come look my shop!” Just walk past if you don’t want to or you’ll end up in there for ages while they pull down every pashmina they own from the wall. Read More: How to Ship Souvenirs Home From India For more tips on making clothes in Goa, check out my Goa Ebook.  Click here to buy it . What to buy in India based on region What to buy in Rajasthan I’m starting with Rajasthan because it’s the EPITOME of shopping in India. I’m not exaggerating when I say you’ll see identical things here that you’d seen in Anthropolgie, Urban Outfitters, Free People, and more. When interior designers get to work, many source from Rajasthan, particularly Jaipur. Giant warehouses will have someone guide you around to see everything- it’s insane. The main things to buy in Rajasthan are  wooden furniture, silver and gemstone jewelry, fabrics, wholesale clothing, leather shoes, jackets, purses, notebooks, and mirror work traditional fabrics, as well as wooden trinkets &amp; Hindu statues. Another big thing to buys is quilted Rajasthani wall hangings, blankets, pillow covers, and cushions. You can get the duvet fillers they sell at Fab India much cheaper here.  this is the wall-hanging I bought Jaipur is the king of shopping and sourcing. Every designer in Goa, and even Singapore, and Bali goes to Jaipur to collect their supplies for the year. You will get these things elsewhere like Goa but at much higher prices and oftentimes, inauthentic. Check out these three articles for specific shops to go. Little Black Book, A Jaipur Shopping Guide Shopping in Jaipur, 8 shops not to miss My tips on buying Rajasthani wall hangings What to buy in Goa I am not about buying Indian things in Goa. It’s all sourced out from Rajasthan in my opinion it’s not great quality. For example, the wall hangings here clearly come from a factory and are not hand done. All Goa clothes! For shopping in Goa, I stick to foreigners who are making a living as up and coming designers here. They make gorgeous stuff and often times source the best silks and cottons from around India. Some of my favorite designers are FARA , La Vie Boheme , TIA , Cheshire Cat , Shoop Doop , Nani Ki, and Alekai. Goa shopping guide What to buy in Delhi Similar to Jaipur, people go here for massive shopping and sourcing trips. Personally, I don’t have luck here because I don’t know where to go. There are famous marketplaces like Chandni Chowk and you can get lucky with wholesale clothing. I’m not sure how it works; I think it’s pieces that didn’t make the cut, or are taken from the factory but you can find Free People, H&amp;M, etc here at super cheap prices if you’re willing to dig. Little Back Book Shahpur Jat Hood guide 7 best stores in Lajpat Nagar 8 Delhi markets for fabulous shopping What to buy in Karnataka Mysore is an amazing place to shop. I loved meeting the local artisans and watching them work in the back alleys. It’s known for “Mysore Silk” which is expensive and actually has gold strands going through it. You can tour the factory. It’s also known for Sandalwood, so you might want to buy Sandalwood incense. You can even make it yourself in the famous Devaraja Market. They are famous for wooden inlay here as well. I bought Khaddi outside Mysore in a rural town, and you may see this around the state. It’s very cheap ( think $3 per meter) and is hand-woven. I got clothing made from the fabric I bought.  I wrote a guide to shopping in Mysore you might find helpful which goes into more detail. Guide to shopping in Mysore what I got made in Goa What to buy in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu Just like Msyore they are famous for their silk sarees. Probably more of a shopping destination for the Indian woman although you could buy the silk and make something else. Make sure to go to an approved shop. What to buy in Mumbai &amp; Pune Shoes! Shoes galore! You can buy sandals or “chappels” all over town and Pune is kind of known for it, near the Osho center. I didn’t get a pair myself, but they could be a nice cheap souvenir for people back home. When my parents visited Mumbai, I took them to Chor Bazaar , the “thieves market”. Unless you are buying for a home, you probably will just look- there is amazing antique furniture which is expensive but cheap considering how old and special it is. Of course Mumbai like Delhi has loads of markets and malls, and you could shop for days. from the luxury guide to mumbai on the blog What to buy in Manali or all of Himachal Pradesh Here you can get cold weather clothes and more specifically, Pashmina, wool, and cashmere. Be careful where you shop because the vast majority is fake. No one would sell a REAL pashmina for 500 Rs. so if they are, it’s not real. FYI: shop owners get really angry when you accuse them of being fake so just walk away rather than argue. You can buy amazing gems. I got great deals on raw rubies, turquoise, and rose quartz. Be careful they aren’t selling fakes or colored glass. I bought my Grandma the most amazing pashmina from a Government shop in Manali. You’ll aslo find Nepalese stuff here. That would be colorful shawls, yak wool capes, and fuzzy caps and mittens. I bought my fair share of these things while I was there. I even bought my dad a traditional “kullu” cap. I couldn’t help myself! Kullu was a cool little stopover in the area. What to buy in Punjab I spend very little time in this region, but see their flower embroidered flower (Phulkari) blankets all over India. I think the ones I see are definitely fake copies. I would love to see the real thing for myself. Sadly I didn’t see these while I was in Amritsar so you’ll want to prepare ahead of time. You can read more about the art here: Phulkari traditional Punjab art What to buy in Darjeeling &amp; Munnar Tea! Not a hard one. These are hugely popular tourist destinations. Munnar being inland Kerala and Darjeeling up North near Calcutta side. It’s fun to tour a tea plantation and buy tea while you’re there! You can get the tea in markets all over India though, so don’t fret if you don’t make it here. Kashmir I haven’t been up this far North yet, but they are famous for shawls and carpets/rugs. One day I’ll shop here! What to buy in West Bengal This is the area which holds Calcutta. The big thing people buy here is terracotta dishes. The capitol Calcutta is a shopping destination on it’s own and one that I sadly have not yet discovered. Check out this article for information on where to shop in the city top 5 places to shop in Calcutta NE India I just got back from here and didn’t do a  crazy amount of shopping but I did buy about $100 worth of fabrics to get clothing made back in Goa. There are government owned “artisan” shops were you can see the fabric being hand-woven and buy it there at amazing rates. I love what I bought and will share photos once I make the clothes! You can also buy fun things made from Bamboo &amp; the famous striped bags that every women in the area carries."https://hippie-inheels.com/find-a-house-in-goa/,india,"Here Are The Cutest Luxury &amp; Budget Airbnb’s in Goa One of the biggest issues with looking for an airbnb in Goa or hotel for that matter is that you don’t know the location THAT WELL of where you are going. It’s hard to say if the suburb or in Goa’s case, village, is going to be near to what you want. It can take a lot of time to map this out and in general find a house in Goa that you think will work well. Luckily, I’m here to help you find a house in Goa using airbnb! There’s SO much online about it from rental companies it’s overwhelming. I recently had to do some Airbnb research for a client coming to Goa (I do travel planning via Skype) and thought I’d share some of these finds. I’ve been living in Goa almost 4 years and know what type of house to look for, what areas are good, and what amenities you need in India (water filter, A/C, WiFi, etc are things to keep in mind). I’ll list places that tick many of the boxes, if not all! After reading, if you find an Airbnb you want to book, you can  use this link  to sign up for an Airbnb account and get 1,000 Rs ($15 USD) off your booking. Once you sign up, when you click on the links below the amount will be there ready to be used. Why stay in an Airbnb in Goa? I often recommend staying in an Airbnb in Goa to my readers for these reasons: If you are in a group of 4+ people, it will save money most often They are usually more secluded from the tourist areas They often come with a housekeeper/cook You can feel like you are at “home” rather than a tourist in a hotel Here are some of the cutest Airbnb in Goa I have found, some from the higher end of scale, some are unique Airbnb’s in Goa, and some are much more budget friendly. I’ll mention a little on the location of each. I haven’t stayed at any of these, this is just to help you narrow your search down. Find a House in Goa Using Airbnb My little hideaway in Mandrem If you’ve read my posts about Goa you know I love Jamboree Creek. My friend Priyanka runs this place and she’s as nice as they come. It’s an eco resort. They have a pool, really well priced huts (A/C available), and offer oftentimes FREE yoga classes (or Capoiera, whatever happens to be going on). It’s a hippy jungle vibe and just 10 minutes walk to the beach on a private path. It’s my getaway from home. Prices are listed at 3270 Rs per night ($50 USD).  Book it here . 3 Bedroom Apartment Arpora Arpora is a great area which is why I’ve listed this first. This place is listed as accommodating 8 people. He has 78 reviews and they are nearly perfect. The place looks clean and modern. Best of all, it’s priced at 3,600 Rs ($54) per night. Even if you split that with just 4 people it’s a better deal than a beach shack. Arpora is where the famous Saturday Night Market happens and it’s just 10 minutes from Anjuna and the beach. It’s kind of in the middle of everything and where my fave health food shop, Natti’s Natural’s is. Book it here . 1 bedroom with kitchen in Arambol This place looks adorable. Here are the benefits: Arambol is difficult to walk guesthouse to guesthouse and negotiate and people aren’t usually willing to wiggle under 1000 RS a night. He’s charging just under 1,000 Rs a night ($15). You could split this with a friend and it’d be dirt cheap. Also, it has a kitchen and that’s a LOT of money saved there. You won’t get this in a guesthouse or most Indian hostels. Arambol is the hippiest of all hippy places: drum circles, festivals, acid trips, and all! The owner also lists that he lives nearby and can help with scooter rental, etc. Book it here . If you want more space, he has a similar property, same place, more rooms you can look at here . Modern 3 BR villa in Assagao I live in Assagao, so clearly I love it. Assagao is a village about 10 minutes from Vagator beach. You’ll see monkeys for sure out here. This place is new, it’s next to Ciao Bella my favorite Italian restaurant. It’s got a pool. There are 10 private villas in a complex. It’s listed at 16,000 Rs. per night ($230 USD) split between 6 people = $38 per person. Take it for a week and get a 10% discount. Book it here . 26 guest boutique heritage property in Sangolda This huge house is a 5 minute walk from Anjuna beach. If you have a huge family gathering or wedding this 12 bedroom place would be perfect. There is a pool, BBQ, and jacuzzi. At 44,000 Rs or $650 USD a night for 12 rooms, it’s a steal for big groups. Two properties in Candolim and Calangute These two areas are right next to each other and these two gorgeous villas are owned by the same people I’m grouping them together. They fit 10 people. This area is known for being more touristy. It is also where all the clubs are. Most Indians families that email me, prefer this area. BOTH places have pools, modern amenities, and are really pretty. One has a pool table! They are each around 15,000 Rs per night ($224 USD). For 10 people, it’s a great deal! Check them both out in the links above. Portuguese Design Villa in Anjuna This place is AMAZING and has been featured for it’s design in magazine. If you’re interested in Goa’s past as being Portuguese influenced, you’ll love this place. It holds 10 people at 25,000 Rs. per night ($374 USD). It’s walkable distance to the beach and has amazing reviews. Book it here . Tara Verde design villa in Parra I’m super partial to this place because I think it’s the prettiest one on the list. Parra is an awesome village and just a quick 10 minutes drive to the beach. This place holds 14 people and comes with staff to cook for you. It’s 32,000 Rs plus a 12% discount if you book for a week. Book it here . Friend’s place in Calangute My friend Jules revamped this family home and started to rent it out towards the end of season last year. When there aren’t guests I sneak and use the pool! It’s a wonderful house and I can vouch that she’s a sweetheart. The staff is really nice and cooks you breakfast (other meals on request). 14 people can stay and it’s about 60,000 Rs per night ($900 USD). It’s a 2 minute walk to beach, has an infinity pool, and is next to the popular restaurant A Reverie (but far enough away you don’t hear it). Book it here . Mansion in Vagator This 10 person place is 5 minutes from Thalassa my favorite restaurant in Vagator.It’s beautiful and the 4 bedroom place has a private pool, WiFi, chefs on request, and more. It goes for 43,000 Rs or ($644 USD) per night. I know these prices might seem high, but Goa is expensive AND these are for 10+ people.  Book it here . As you can see I’ve listed mostly villas that hold 10+ people in them. That is because Airbnb is best for big groups. I would suggest if you are 4 or more people to look into Airbnb in Goa. Of course they are great for less people too- just take a look for yourself."https://hippie-inheels.com/best-indian-honeymoon-destinations/,india,"5 Most Romantic Places for an Indian Honeymoon I am not really one to think about my next destination based on romance. In fact, I never have. I probably never will. But I don’t write this blog for ME, I write it for my lovely readers, YOU! I know that you may actually want to know where to book romantic places in India or where the locals think is the best Indian honeymoon spot. I left out boat rides on the backwaters of Kerala, week-long holidays in Goa , camel safaris in Rajasthan , and houseboats in Srinagar… because every other article about romance in India claims these to be the best. Since when is a bumpy camel ride romantic? I want to share the honeymoon places in India I might consider if I were the one getting hitched. I’m going to narrow it down to the top five honeymoon destinations in India – and most are a splurge – but then that’s what honeymoons are for! 5 Most Romantic Indian Honeymoon Destinations in India 1. Glamping in Ranthambore Why not spend your time in a luxury campground surrounded by tigers!? Waking up to coffee and great views, spending your days on a safari, and the nights in a fancy ass tent… not bad! Two that look amazing and are on my mental bucket list are both the Oberoi Vanyavilas and Sher Bagh. Check rates and availability at the Oberoi Vanyavilas . Check rates and availability at the Sher Bagh . image via  Ashwin Kumar 2. Luxury in Shimla A week in the Himalayas is always a good idea. This is a huge honeymoon spot and where the Brit’s used to vacation back in the day. Because of that, there are loads of options for high-end luxury hotels. One of the most famous is Oberoi’s, Wildflower Hall. Check availability and rates at the Oberoi here . 3. Beach bungalow in Andamans The Andaman’s are the same as the Seychelles and Maldives in terms of how they look. You can most definitely have your dream honeymoon here – and at a little bit lower price than the other places. The photos speak for themselves. Check rates and availability at  Barefoot at Havelock . 4. Renting a villa in Sikkim This is what Airbnb is great for (use my link there for $40 off your stay). Sikkim is a gorgeous town in the NE side of India in the mountains and you can stop and see Darjeeling tea fields on the way. But instead of checking in at a hotel, rent out a little villa (preferably one with a housekeeper… most in India will have staff and even a cook). The best time to go here is the early season (Oct-Nov). 5. Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur I’d be crazy to make this list without this infamous spot and just go ahead and pick out the Taj Udaipur for you. A huge marble mansion/fortress/palace in the middle of a lake.. views of the Ghats, boats all around, lunch and dinner on the roof, and trips into town to see the markets and elephants even! Plus, this is one of the most luxurious Taj hotels in India."https://hippie-inheels.com/things-to-do-in-udaipur/,india,"Things to do in Udaipur You MUST NOT MISS: How to Have the Best Time in My Favorite City in India My recent visit to Rajasthan was a really special trip for me because I went on October 13th, almost exactly five years after the first time I went to Rajasthan!

I was excited to see Udaipur from a new angle – and I was not disappointed!

I suggest this anyway as it shows you a fuller picture of the city AND in these posts, I go into more detail about the history and culture of the area. The basic thing to know is that this is the “white city” of India or “Venice of India”. It’s a small city built around four lakes, with Lake Pichola being the most popular, and has many Ghats around (stairwells to the lake with people swimming and doing laundry). It’s as laid-back as an Indian city can be and somewhere that should be #1 on your Rajasthan itinerary and top 5 in your India itinerary overall!

I have taken a train here before and I have taken a bus out of here. The stations are close to town. Here’s more information on trains and buses in India . Flights within Rajasthan are expensive and the major cities are all about 5 hours from each other so it’s best to travel via taxi or public transportation rather than fly once you are within Rajasthan. Flights to Udaipur: From Goa, of course, I had to fly. I found a deal on Kiwi.com  (my go-to for flights) for around 4,000 rs or $60 USD into Udaipur airport. The airport itself is outside the city about 40 minutes and you can call a Uber to take you into town. There are rules about the one-ways in town and past a certain time at night the driver CAN drive into the city center near the lake, but not during the day. They might tell you that you need to get out close to your hotel and get a rickshaw the rest of the way. You can call your hotel and verify if this is true (but with Uber it wouldn’t be a lie, as the longer the trip the better for them!) For me, Uber was the best way to get in and out of the city. Around the lake and the best restaurants and shops it’s all walkable though so once you’re in, you can walk or for longer distances take a rickshaw. They are so cheap and save so much time! Taxis in and out of Udaipur: My trip this time was Udaipur &gt; Jodhpur &gt; Jaipur. From Udaipur to Jodhpur I took a private taxi which I hired from Vicky’s Travels just outside my hotel, Jagat Niwas. He gave me a rate of 3,500 Rs without negotiating and it was the perfect ride with the driver coming a couple of days later to collect me from the hotel. I paid 1,000 Rs in the office ahead of time and gave the rest to the driver. This rate included A/C car and tolls. Because I was traveling with a friend, the split rate was $32 USD. Being peak travel season in India meant that this was cheaper than the 2 A/C train ride we looked into and although more expensive than a bus, WAY faster. Another major reason to go by car is that the price included a 50 km detour to THREE stops which are pretty epic (you can read about them here in detail ). This time we wanted to get there fast and I’d seen all these places before, so only stopped at Ranakpur Temple  (funny story there). Contact for Vicky’s tours (you can call or WhatsApp him): +91 99838 53111 or you can find their shop at Gangour Ghat Road, Jagdish Chowk, near Jagat Niwas hotel. Best Hotels in Udaipur There are an overwhelming amount of hotels in Udaipur and most are cute family-run Havelis so it can be really hard to find that gem of the best boutique hotels in Udaipur with a view or even budget hotels in Udaipur near Lake Pichola. But don’t worry – I finally found the most EPIC property and honestly, Tia and I both said it’s the best place we’ve stayed in India . I’ll share about my hotel, Jagat Niwas, and give you a few other options I know about. Here are some key reasons you should choose Jagat Niwas on your trip to Udaipur: 17th Century Haveli with the Rajasthani charm you definitely want Rates are based on various room types ranging from 3,000 Rs to 10,000 Rs. Epic lake views from the rooms, restaurant, and rooftop The BEST suite is under $200/night and that is insane for what you are getting Family-run and the nicest staff. Great Indian food – must try the traditional Rajasthani thali. Read reviews and check availability for Jagat Niwas here . If you have questions you can get in touch with them directly by emailing them: mail@jagatniwaspalace.com. Jagat Niwas was so amazing that I actually have too many photos to share, so am going to write a complete post just about the hotel and the boat ride I did with them! I’ll link to that soon. When it comes to five-star hotels here there is the notorious Taj Lake Palace hotel in the middle of the lake. You will have to take a boat every time you want to leave. Non-guests cannot visit the Taj in Udaipur. Most of the other 5-star hotels are not right on the lake and here in Udaipur, I highly recommend a lake view hotel. Previously, I stayed a more budget option called Hibiscus Guesthouse which at the time was 1,700 Rs. per night and had views of the lake but is now 2,500 per night. Check out my old backpacker’s post about Udaipur  to see the seriously budget 300 Rs. options. Restaurants in Udaipur I was here just three days, so I couldn’t try all the best restaurants around but I did try to focus on the places that were ranked really well and sort through which were worth going to. I had pretty good luck with tasty food in Udaipur. In general, the Western food is not good here so stick to Indian food while traveling Udaipur. There are so many delicious restaurants here! PS: In Jodhpur not so much, so if you’re headed there next then EAT UP! lol. Jagat Niwas – My hotel had great food. I had malai chicken tikka kebabs, veg kadai, and mutton seekh kebabs, as well as a Rajasthani traditional lunch with  dal batti the most popular dish in the state. Natural View Restaurant – Only ranked 50th in the city, this was recommended to me by a member of my India Travel Tips Facebook group  and WOW it was so so good with the best view in Lal Ghat. Again, had to get my chicken tikka kebab but it’s different everywhere, haha. Rainbow Restaurant – a multi-cuisine place that was quite tasty! Chirag Rooftop Restaurant – Tia liked her eggplant curry here but I wasn’t stoked with my meal. The view was okay and monkeys were hanging around Charcoal by Carlsson – for BBQ, grilled meat, and a mix of western and Indian food Grasswood Cafe – a healthy cafe with vegan options for Western food like cheese toasties, good real coffee, WiFi, and lots of travelers hanging out in the A/C. Ambrai – I went here years ago and didn’t get a chance to go back but had to mention it because I still remember this tasty meal with the perfect view! Udaipur Shopping Shop the bottoms here Shop the bottoms here Shop the bottoms here You’ll see lots of standard “tourist” shops here with ali baba pants, Rajasthani textiles, pashminas, tee shirts, and dresses but for me it’s all cheaper in Jaipur so I didn’t shop in Udaipur at all, but I did look a little haha it’s impossible not to! Things to do in Udaipur as a Tourist There is a lot here for tourists to do and stay entertained during their time in Udaipur. I have written a little spiritual guide of things to do in Udaipur in this article  and while there this time, checked that it is all still accurate. Because nothing has changed, it makes the most sense for you to read that rather than me to type it all out again. Shop the cape here and the similar jeans here I’ll just list the items here and in this link , you can read more about each one: Art class Yoga &amp; Meditation class Visiting Animal Aid Unlimited Trekking Ayurvedic Massage Boat tour (more on this in its own article as I did a new one that was amazing) Sunset traditional dancing at Bagore Ki Haveli Cooking classes (not mentioned in that post but there are signs everywhere) Don’t Forget These Tourist Places to Visit in Udaipur – They Are the Main Reason to Visit! City Palace Udaipur Shop the wrap here The city palace is the #1 attraction in Udaipur and it does NOT disappoint. Of all the forts, temples, and palaces in India, this is my favorite building. Every inch of it is incredible. Give yourself a couple of hours here if you are into photography! All of my outfits on this trip are from Tia’s shop here in Goa which she also sells online on Etsy. I’ve linked to them. PS: I do cover my shoulders while walking around the streets but in a quiet empty alley or in a room like above at the palace, I do take my shawl of for pictures :) I have a post coming soon with all my outfits from this trip and where to buy them. Lake Palace Udaipur Shop the top here The Lake Palace is the Taj Hotel and you cannot actually go onto it but can go around it. This is best seen from the boat which will go quite close for photos – and I’m going to share all about our boat ride in another article because it was AMAZING. Monsoon Palace This palace is a little outside of town (just 100 Rs with Uber) and I’d say if you have a third day here with not a lot to do then go for a visit, but it’s not the BEST place compared to the City Palace. It does have good views of all the lakes below. Temples The most popular temple is Jagdish Temple which is right in the center of town near the markets and City Palace. You couldn’t miss it if you tried. I really feel like this guy was laying here five years ago when I was there – or else, I just had some weird deja vu when I saw him! Shop the bottoms here Yep, you might find a sacred cow inside! Often Eklingji Temple and Drinathji Temple are listed as temples to visit in Udaipur but they are missions away and I don’t recommend taking the time to do this unless you are very interested in temples. Other Lakes There are four lakes in Udaipur, with Lake Pichola being the most famous. If you fancy it, you can visit the other three which was “top attractions” according to guidebooks but to be honest, I think that’s a waste of time as a lake is a lake and Pichola is the prettiest! I really hope this information on traveling Udaipur will help you know which places to visit in Udaipur are really worth it and which to skip – as well as let you in on the best hotel in town and yummy food!"https://hippie-inheels.com/best-places-to-visit-in-india-from-five-years-of-exploration/,india,"The 30 Best Places to Visit in India It’s so hard to write this post and narrow down my favorite places here but I get asked about the best places to visit in India from readers and usually email them my favorites, so figured I should put it in a blog post. There are epic tourist places in India that are worth seeing but there are also some smaller towns that I’ve loved to go to and had amazing experiences at.  It’s not just about seeing the  famous places in India, it’s about having cool experiences there – taking tours, cooking classes, trying massages, all of it! You can fill all your time with forts, palaces, and historical places in India but make sure that you really look around and see the beauty and go out and explore it! From the tea fields to the beaches, I’ve spent five years traveling around this amazing country – here are my favorites for travelers who have no choice but to limit their destinations. I’ll give some travel tips at the end of the article as well. I won’t say too much about each place – you can click through on each one to read more details from my blog posts on them. 30 Best Places to Visit in India 1. Varanasi Varanasi is by far the most unique place I’ve been in the entire world. This is where many Hindus come to be cremated, along the Ganges River. You will see sadhu’s like the man above, with human ashes on them. Here are some tips on what to expect at the burning ghats, and some general travel tips on Varanasi. 2. Taj Mahal The Taj Mahal is world famous for a reason – it’s stunning! I hated being there I have to admit (you are herded like cattle through huge crowds if it’s busy but here are some tips to visit the best way possible like showing up for sunrise and saying no to photos. 3. Anjuna / Vagator Anjuna, my home of the last five years, is the land of hippie vibes and the end of the hippie trail in the 60-70’s. Many foreigners came here, burnt their passports, and lived naked on the beach. Those days are gone but some of them are still here and the music, parties, and laid-back attitude has stuck around, too. Here’s my ultimate guide to Goa . 4. Rann of Kutch This is where you’ll find the huge salt plains in India. Make sure to visit at the right time (Nov-Feb) or you might show up to find it under water. You can experience local life here and see how artisans make traditional clothing. CN Traveler called it the new fashion capital of India. 5. Tawang In Tawang, you can visit the largest working Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in the world. This once was Tibet and the food, language and people are Tibetan although now they are Indian. Come and learn about their culture! It’s gorgeous, but very very cold. It’s one of the highest places I’ve been in India! Read up a bit about Tawang here . 6. Kaziranga National Park There aren’t many rhinos left in the world (they are endangered) but this park has worked hard to repopulate them and keep them safe from poachers. Some people buy the horns for Chinese medicine, and poaching is a major issue. We got very close to the rhinos here and it was nothing but magical. Here’s my guide . 7. Darjeeling Darjeeling is known for it’s rolling tea fields. It’s in West Bengal at the base of the Himalaya Mountains. This is where the Brits would come for vacation back when they were in control of India. Make sure you ride the toy train and check out this post for more things to do here. 8. BR Hills This is short for Biligirirangana Hills, which is a protected area in Karnataka just near the Tamil Nadu border. This wildlife sanctuary has tigers but it has tribal people too, called the Soliga, and this is in my top 5 places I’ve ever been in India and maybe even in the world. It’s so unique. 9. Mysore Mysore is my favorite Indian city. There are so many parks, so little traffic, and the market is extraordinary! If you want to ease into India by starting in a small city, want to try Ayurveda, or do a yoga teacher training (the best school is here), this is where you want to be. You can also take amazing day trips from Mysore . This article has 7 must-do’s in Mysore . 10. Rishikesh We all know by now that the Beatles and other celebs loved Rishikesh and came here to be with their guru and write. Still, it’s a place for yogis and hippies. The Ganges runs through the cute, busy, town and many tourists are here learning to teach yoga themselves. Here are my tips for Rishikesh. 11. Jaipur Jaipur is all about luxury, royalty, princes, elephants, jewels, rugs, and indulgence at the many amazing restaurants and bars. I love going to Jaipur. Check out my guide here . 12. Sikkim Sikkim is nestled into the Himalayas on the East side of India, all the way up by Bhutan and Nepal. The views are out of this world and you can visit Monasteries, trek, raft, or just stroll around in the cute little town. A few tips for Sikkim, here . 13. Amritsar The Golden Temple is in Amritsar, a unique Sikh temple (made of gold) that is the most stunning temple I’ve ever seen and a place that many make a pilgrimage to in their lives. You can also go to the Wagah border of Pakistan while you are here which is literally bizarre (please read this to know why). Here are some tips for visiting Amritsar . 14. Udaipur India’s romantic white city has stolen my heart – I LOVE this city. It’s small and wraps around four lakes, with Lake Pichola being the most popular. You must stay in my favorite guesthouse there (a palace with lake views for under $50-$200 a night). Here is my guide to Udaipur . I am sure I’ll be back for the third time! 15. Chinnakanal While Darjeeling is the most popular place to see the tea fields in India, Munnar/Chinnakanal was closer to me and is said to be just as beautiful. I loved visiting and seeing how the tea is made, plus the town is very cute with many adventure trekking options. Here are my tips on Chinnakanal . 16. Hampi The most epic place in India is Hampi, hands down. This is Jurassic Park meets the Flintstones with huge boulders you can just picture dinosaurs walking through! You should also visit nearby temples and caves of Badami and Aihole . Here are my tips for Hampi , which I have visited four times now! 17. Meghalaya image by  Ashwin Kumar   One of the few places on this list I haven’t yet been to but am dying to see – of all the beauty of India, the photos of this state make me want to visit so badly! The state name translates to “abode of clouds”. From Shillong to the Living Root bridge, if you love nature this is for you! Read more tips here . 18. Varkala To be honest, Varkala doesn’t have a lot of charm but it’s a nice, cheap, beach town. While the shopping and food is mediocre, the views are beautiful, it’s way less crowded than Goa but just as Westernized and the surf is good. 19. Shimla Shimla is a very popular hill station town in the Himalayas on the west side of India. It is stunning and it is a VERY small town. This was a vacation place for the British back in the day and today is a popular honeymoon destination in India. Here is my experience there . 20. Jaisalmer While wandering around Rajasthan, you should absolutely make the trip out to Jaisalmer, near the Pakistan border. Here you can be in a city that seems like it’s made only out of sand, with a huge fort towering over it, and go out on a camel safari in the Thar Desert. Here are tips for Jaisalmer , and here some tips for the camel safari . 21. Alleppey I’m sure you’ve seen the backwaters of Kerala in photos, and I have to say it IS truly as stunning as it looks. I’m more into staying a day on the boat rather than overnight, but I loved going down the river and watching the birds. Here is what to expect on a houseboat overnight . 22. Ziro Valley In Northeast India, in a small state called Arunachal Pradesh, you’ll find Ziro Valley – it’s where the Apatani tribe live and it’s unbelievable. They worship the moon and sun, traditionally, although some are now converted to Christianity. It’s something you would picture from Nat Geo. I am so lucky to have visited! You can stay overnight and I recommend going before it becomes a UNESCO site and gets more tourists, as now it’s permit-only and fewer people go. Here’s my article about Ziro . 23. The Andaman Islands I have not yet ventured to these islands as I always need to do a visa run when I can afford the flights, and leave India. These are the epitome of perfection: white sand, clear water – basically like the Seychelles or Maldives. Here are some do’s and don’ts for visiting . 24. Leh Leh is said to be the most beautiful place not just in India, but in the world. You can trek through the snowy mountains, see crystal clear glacial lakes, or go on a safari to try and spot a snow leopard. Read up on some Leh tips here . 25. Kashmir This is like nowhere else in India, and the thing to do here is to sleep on a houseboat on Dal Lake. Unlike seeing the topical views from your houseboat in Alleppey, here you’ll see the Himalaya mountains. Is you’re worried about safety, check out this article . 26. Jodhpur Jodhpur is India’s blue city and I have visited twice. I love this city – it’s highly populated but it’s got a small town vibe with it’s little alleys that even rickshaws can’t fit through. If you like phtoography, it’s a must. There’s a fort as well overlooking the town. Here’s my Jodhpur guide . I highly recommend visiting the Bishnoi people on a tour. 27. Sunderbans image via Ankur P This area of land is in West Bengal and is one of the natural wonders of the world due to the huge mass of mangroves. If you’re into nature, safaris, etc you will love this – it’s not too far from Calcutta and the Ganges runs through it (to give you an idea how big that river is!). Here are some travel tips . 28. Coorg Of all the natural beautiful places in Karnataka (the gem of India in my opinion), Coorg is my favorite. I loved finding secret waterfalls, eating Pandi curry, and trying the local (strong) drip coffee. My homestay even had homemade wine! Here are some tips for visitng Coorg , some more tips , and a list of 11 things to do here (can you tell I liked visiting!?) 29. McLeod Ganj I will never forget visiting Dharamsala and McLeod Ganj when the Dalai Lama was there. I listened to him speak for hours ( read about that here ). This is where many Tibetans came to live in exile and is the home of the Dalai Lama. Here are some tips for McLeod Ganj. 30. Manali Manali is kind of like Goa in the mountains. It’s seasonal, has very hippie vibes, and you could just chill at the many cafe’s run by expats – OR you can go trekking, paragliding, and be really adventurous!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxurious-indian-islands/,india,"4 Luxurious Indian Islands (many people don’t know exist) India has a luxurious side to it. I know it’s got a stereotyped “dirty loud India” side as well, but the Indian islands that surround the country rival any of the top islands of the world. I sadly have been to NONE of them yet which is a real shame. Reason being, whenever we have the time to go it seems we need a visa run and we have to leave India, so some of these require long flights but since they are Indian they don’t count as leaving. It just hasn’t worked out yet. These are the most luxurious Indian islands… that you didn’t know existed!  1. Lakshadweep   A photo posted by Gods Own Country Kerala (@godsowncountrykerala) on Aug 19, 2016 at 8:06am PDT When I think of this island, I think of the cheap scuba certificate I could get in the Laccadive sea, but when Pinterest users look they see this usually with the wrong place captioned: Lakshadweep (meaning one hundred thousand islands) is off the coast of Kerala to the West of India and made up of 36 small islands. Kavaratti is the most popular and has more development on it. Kadmat is where you want to get your scuba on; it has the prettiest water in India! This is mostly visited by Indian tourists as it’s still pretty secret around the world. Other popular islands here are Agatti and Bangaram. Tips: Get here from Kochi easily and dress modest for the Muslim crowd. Avoid July through September for monsoon. Technically no alcohol is allowed and tourists need to get a permit to visit. 2. Andaman and Nicobar Islands.   A photo posted by junnybox (@junnybox) on Aug 24, 2016 at 12:06am PDT The Andaman’s are probably the most popular set of islands for foreign tourists to go to while in India. These are in the Andaman Sea to the East side of India. From the beginning of literature these islands have been discussed by explorers, and some wrote they were full of cannibals.  They were known as “black waters” of the Indian Ocean and were full of prisoners! Now they are full of 5-star hotels and tourists. This is another great place to get your scuba certificates. The Islands have had a fight to stay alive while Tsunamis and earthquakes literally tear the small islands into pieces and hit the large ones hard. They have recently been declared a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve. You may have heard about the Nicobar Islands, as some theorists believe the missing Malaysia airlines flight landed here. Tip: beware of swimming. Nearby to Havelock Island is a reservation for saltwater crocodiles and I know of someone who was with a friend who was tragically killed swimming outside a fancy resort. In the last 25 years, there have been 24 deaths from crocodile attacks. There are apparently not enough signs up warning tourists, although I haven’t been to see for myself. Even swimming in open ocean away from rivers and mangroves is not always safe. Also, keep in mind there are some tribal areas here and you will need permits to visit. 3. St. Mary’s Islands   A photo posted by Rudranil Das (@rdas_photography) on Aug 21, 2016 at 8:16am PDT St Mary’s islands are a set of four, located off Udupi, Karnataka. These “coconut islands” are in the Arabian sea (west side of India). Here you’ll see giant columns of lava stone because of the split off of Madagascar, way back when… well, you know. I seriously struggle in science, but I do know that the lava situation here is incredible rare. Tips: there are guards to make sure you don’t swim anywhere dangerous, but in case they are on tea break, use good judgment near rocks. You’ll go here by boat for a day trip (this is your only option). 4. Netrani Island.   A photo posted by Sukanya Raju (@sudotkanya) on Nov 22, 2015 at 11:25am PST Also called Pigeon Island, this is off the coast of Karnataka in the Arabian Sea about 20 km from Murudeshwara to the west of India. This is a major scuba destination for tourists in Goa and Kerala. During monsoon, you can’t go to this island. Any island that is shaped like a heart is worth a visit! Tip: Don’t try to go here alone. The Indian Navy uses the island adjacent for target practice.   So there we have the luxury Indian islands… with beaches of white sand you didn’t think was possible in India!"https://hippie-inheels.com/european-cities-india/,india,"Get a Dose of Europe in India | 13 Towns As a very old country, India has a unique past. You can see its history while traveling through cities. Even if you live in India and just want a break or something new, why not get a taste of a non-Indian place in India? There are many European towns in India (not anymore technically, but stylistically) that you can spend a week in and get a taste of Europe. India was colonized by different countries in different areas, some more recently than others. The foreigners have left, but they left behind some European charm. Others were never taken over by their dopplegangers but just look incredibly similar. These aren’t actual European cities in India. Places in India that look European 1. French in Pondicherry The French are long gone from Pondicherry, now known for the surf. It has a French look in many ways from the paint jobs of the buildings to the cute cafes. France /  Pondicherry 2. Ancient Ruins of Rome or Athens in Hampi If you want to wander around ancient stones from the people of the past, you can do that in Hampi just like in Athens or Rome. Read more on Hampi: Guide to Hampi Rome  / Hampi 3. Scotland in Coorg It’s not far-fetched to call Coorg the Scotland of India, as many do with its bright green hills and mountains with mist. Here, people worship the nature. Coorg is one of the coolest places in India. Check out this article 11 kickass things to do in Coorg . Scotland / Coorg  (Thadiyandamol) 4. Azores in Munnar West of Portugal is an island known as the only tea plantation in Europe. India has its own town known for tea called Munnar in Kerala. Azores / Munnar 5. Iceland in Sikkim Want to do some outdoor snow activities? Find adventure with the glaciers of Sikkim, which could be confused for the lakes of Iceland. Iceland / Sikkim 6. Portuguese in Panjim The old churches still stand tall and people even now are Catholic in this area of India. If you wonder Panjim, the capital, the alleys are very telling of Goa’s past. Many locals have the last name D’Souza or Fernandez. Goa  (Panjim) /  Portugal 7. Britain in Mumbai or Mysore When wondering through the streets you can’t help but notice the British architecture. For example compare Big Ben to the Rajabai tower! There’s still a strong connection between the Britain and India in many cities, but I especially loved it in these two. UK / Mumbai 8.  Venice in Udaipur The floating palace in the lake of Udaipur makes it feel very romantic and luxurious. There’s no surprise that Udaipur is called the “Venice of India”. Some also call the backwater boats in Kerala “Venice of India” so I guess there are two! Venice / Udaipur 9. Swiss in Khajjiar When you wander through Shimla’s charming town, you won’t be surprised that it’s where the British chose to vacation back in the day. It looks very similar to the Swiss towns I saw while backpacking through the Alps: rolling green hills, snow-capped mountains, cute little homes.   Switzerland  /  Khajjiar 10. Greek Islands in the Andaman’s The Andaman’s are a group of stunning islands of India. Clear blue water, luxury villas dotting along the water, and a big diving and honeymoon destination, it’s great to know India has a place like this! Greek Islands / Andamans 11. Ireland in Maharashtra When driving through the coast line of this state in the rain, I couldn’t help but be brought back to when I hiked along the coast of Ireland in the rain. The forest up to the ocean isn’t tropical palm trees, but looks like one I would see in Ireland or somewhere like Oregon. Ireland / Ratnagiri 12. Lithuania in Jaipur The Rambagh Palace in Jaipur is what many consider to be a similar castle to Trakai Castle in Lithuania. I don’t disagree it has some charm, but it’s not a perfect math. Lithuania / Jaipur 13. Bordeaux or Tuscany in Nashik Want wine? Check out the very European looking vinyard of Sula wines in Maharashtra. Italy  / Nashik There are so many amazing places in India that are great on their own. Even if an Indian national didn’t leave their country, they could see so much beauty of the world! One thing I love about India is its huge array of landscapes. This isn’t to say Europe doesn’t have it’s charm, but to show you how varied India really is!"https://hippie-inheels.com/places-visit-goa-tourists/,india,"Places to Visit in Goa For Tourists Ever wonder what tourists get up to in Goa ? I mean, it’s a beach destination but what else is here for tourists… There is a lot! Because I live here, I haven’t gone into tourist mode and actually haven’t been to some places to visit in Goa on this list (yes, even after nearly 4 years). I’m going to go all “Lonely Planet” and tell you the places to visit in Goa that tourists come here looking for since guidebooks say they are the best! Read More: 3 day Goa itinerary top 50 things to do in Goa full Goa guide If you are coming to Goa, you definitely need my ebook, Insider’s Guide to Goa . It’s 170 pages filled with the most up to date, comprehensive information about Goa plus it has all my secret places to go that I’ve found after living here almost five years.This book has 50x more information about Goa than my blog and is organized to make things easy for you to find.  Click here to buy it now . Places to Visit in Goa for Tourists Basilica de Bom Jesus This is a UNESCO Heritage Site. It’s located in Old Goa. To get here you’ll probably want to hire a taxi driver. Old Goa, in general, is a huge tourist attraction in Goa because the churches here were built by the Portuguese in the 1600’s. It’s free to enter and you need to cover your shoulders and wear something that covers your legs at least to your knees. Church of St. Francis of Assisi This is the other popular church in Old Goa so you can’t miss it. They are right next to each other. It was built at the same time by the Portuguese. Here’s what I have listed as what to see in Old Goa . Dudsagar Falls This is only 60 km from Panjim, near the Karnataka border. Again you’ll want to hire a driver because the roads are windy and it’s probably as much to rent a car! The waterfall is 310 meters high and is Goa’s tallest waterfall. It’s in the Western Ghats which is one of the most diverse biospheres in the world. Hot Air Balloon Goa There is only one company that does this in Goa, Tiger Balloon Safari . Their location is Chandor, Goa. You do have to book online and it does book up fast. Mangueshi Temple This is one of Goa’s oldest temples. This is a local favorite, so make you dress appropriately when you visit. It has a lot of history you can read about here . 18th June Road Want to explore Panjim? You’ll definitely end up on this road at some point. The 18th June is an important date in Goa’s history because it’s when the Revolution from the Portuguese happened. This is listed as the top shopping place in Panjim and people seem to be all about Bombay Bazaar which is just a shop to buy homewares and clothing. Basically, while here you can visit churches in Panjim and eat street food while popping into all the shops. For me, I’m more interested in wandering around Fontainhas and seeing the cool streets that were built by the Portuguese. Very European! Here is my post about where to shop in Panjim. Lamgau Caves These are located NE of Panjim about an hour driving. Seeing caves with sketching of Hindu gods is something people love to see in Goa and this is the only cave I know of like this in Goa. While it isn’t complete, is small, and doesn’t compare to a place like Hampi it would be interesting if you aren’t traveling to other areas of Goa. All the Flea Markets There are quite a few to think about seeing. The number one market is the Wednesday Flea market in Anjuna . You can see information in that blog post. You will love the Saturday Night Market in Arpora. There is also two more Saturday night markets in Goa, but they aren’t as good in my opinion. You could choose to also go to Mapusa and brave the traffic at the Friday market. This is the closest to “real India” you’ll get in North Goa. Fort Aguada You could see this in luxury by staying at the Taj Fort Aguada and looking out over the fort while you drink your Mai Tia, or you can visit it for free as a tourist. It’s located on Sinquerim beach. It was built by the Portuguese in the 17th century. Chapora Fort This fort is also free to enter. It’s mostly ruined now but has the best views over Vagator and the Arabian Sea. Fort Tiracol (Fort Terekhol) You’ll have to make the drive up the coast near to Maharashtra border to see this epic fort. This one was actually not Portuguese (it was built by the King of Sawantwadi) but later yes, was taken over by the Portuguese. This is a church inside called St. Anothony’s Church (there are a couple called this in Goa). It was a base for freedom fighters during the Goa revolution. If you come here you might as well visit  Keri Beach which is up this way and totally stunning. The Fort is now a hotel, and a luxury one at that called Fort Tiracol Heritage Hotel. Reis Magos Fort &amp; Church This Fort and Church are both located in Panjim, near the big Mandovi river. These were built in the 1500’s and it’s the oldest church and Fort in Goa making it quite the site for history buffs. I won’t lie there are about 5 more very popular churches in Goa but I’m not adding them to the list because it’s SO redundant and I can’t recommend you go around seeing all these churches. If you are into that, though, here is an article that sums up all the best churches in Goa . Beaches Galore You could go beach crazy here if you wanted to, but here’s a tip: it’s all the same ( “same same but different” as the locals would say). It’s best to stick to just one or two and not think of seeing beaches as “sightseeing” or something to check off your list. You’ve got the most crowded beaches of Calangute, Candolim, and Baga. Anjuna is the party beach. Vagator is pretty calm but still crowded. Ashwem and Mandrem are more beautiful. The beaches in the South are the best: Palolem, Agonda, Colva, and more. Houseboat on Chapora There are so many options from budget to luxury, but I don’t think you’ll find them as cheap as you do in Kerala simply because there just are not enough boats. You should book this ahead of time. You can take an evening tour or you can stay overnight on the boats. Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary You’ll go far into the Western Ghats for this. You can see guar and deer. Supposedly you can see leopards or black panthers also but it’s very rare. This sanctuary  is near Dudsagar Falls so plan accordingly. Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary Bird lovers don’t fret, there is a place especially for you! This is on a small island in the Mandovi River that you take a ferry to, so you will have a lot of peace and quiet there. Naval Aviation Museum You can walk around outside and see the aircraft up close. Then after you go the inside section of the museum to learn about the history of the Indian Navy and the aircraft they use, plus real uniforms and photographs. Sahakari Spice Plantation There are a couple of spice plantations in Goa, but I prefer this one. When you get here you just wander around with a guide while he shows you what the different plants are. Then you have lunch (if you paid for that) which I suggest so you can try simple local food. You could see the elephants but I don’t recommend this as I don’t feel they are treated well and believe that any elephant tamed for tourism is animal cruelty. Did any of these places to visit in Goa interest you? If they didn’t, don’t feel bad. Goa is more about getting into the Goan way of life (slow, relaxed) and just chilling out. While, yes, there are places to visit in Goa for tourists, I personally don’t take my friends from the USA to more than 2-3 places on this list."https://hippie-inheels.com/10-days-kerala-backpacking-tips-itinerary/,india,"Kerala Backpacking Tips &amp; 10 Day Kerala Itinerary Kerala, “God’s Own Country”,  brings in SO many tourists each year and I am going to share my Kerala backpacking tips &amp; Kerala itinerary. It’s one of the most popular states in India and is considered less touristy than Goa and more “real India” (although in my opinion, all of India is “real”). I love when I get to take time to backpack India and Kerala is one of my favorite places. I’ll use the goMowgli map to show you where each place is in the state. The popular spots to stop are Kochi, Alleppey, Thekeddy, Munnar, Kovalam, Trivandrum, Varkala, and Waynad. It’s a lot to see and we covered it on the tour in just under 10 days. I recommend more like 20 days to be honest if you’re going to hit all these places. We didn’t go to Wayanad, Kovalam, or Trivandrum, although I’ve been to 2 of those 3 before so will still discuss them. Kerala Backpacking Tips &amp; Kerala Itinerary 1. KOCHI Most likely, if you’re flying this will be your port of entry. The other option is Trivandrum but Kochi makes the most sense for most itineraries. If you’re coming from Goa it might make sense to take the train to Kochi which I’ve done many times. It’s 17 hours from Thivim station. From Chennai as well you can take the train. Kochi’s hot backpacking zone is called Fort Kochi and that’s where you’ll meet people. Marine Drive is cool but more residential. I used to stay there and have written quite a bit about Kochi which I’ll link below. With goMowgli, we did a few more things that I hadn’t tried yet which included a cooking class! The class was with Leelu, who is sited in Lonely Planet. It was great, although more of a demonstration than a class to participate. We had 6 girls, so perhaps if you are alone, it will be even better. The food was great.  Leelu details: you can email to join a class at bookings@leeluhomestay.com. Located in Fort Kochi. Exploring  Jew Town is not to be missed in Kochi. Although in the past there were many Jewish people living here, now there are only 6, and 70 in all of Kerala. Back in the day, the Maharaja (great king) built a synagogue right next to his palace and temple. He even crowned the torah. 5 Rs. entry fee to synagogue and very small museum, tips appreciated. You can check out Theyyem performances all over Kerala, just ask around. We also checked out a  Kathakali traditional show at the Kerala Kathakali center. I’ve seen this a couple times, but it’s always different so feel free to check out more than one to see more stories. If you go half an hour early, you can watch them put their makeup on.  Kathakali details: Near Santa Cruz Basilica, Fort Kochi. Buy tickets ahead of time which are 300 Rs. We went to the  Kerala Folklore Museum , something I’d been wanting to do. It was unique for sure, but if you’re not into museums, it’s okay to skip. It’s 200 Rs. entry fee or extra if you take in a camera. They took us to a local fishing village was is the BEST thing to do in Kochi, and one of my favorite things I’ve done in Kerala. Read more here:  Top secret #1 thing to do in Kochi For a great hostel, check out Happy Camper which everyone in our group seemed quite pleased with and was centrally located. The cost was 450 Rs. per person for a hostel bed. I stayed in a private room with another girl. If you’re staying in Fort Kochi, you’ll find many “intercontinental” restaurants are the same and can quickly use TripAdvisor to see the top ranked ones. We drove a little ways out to the most famous “puttu” place called  Dhe Puttu which serves this famous Kerala dish of which I was not a fan, but everyone else loved. For more on Kochi, check out these articles I’ve written in the past. – Backwaters and Backalleys of Kochi – But seriously, where’s the fort in Fort Kochi? – Kochi markets, Kerala 2. ALLEPPEY Alleppey is the place where people take houseboats on the backwaters. It’s one of the must do tourist attractions in India for Indian nationals and foreigners alike. Typically, a backpacker doesn’t miss doing this while in India. I wrote about what to expect on a houseboat in Alleppey . 3. THEKADDY This is where you can do your Indian Safari at Periyar National Park. You can trek, camp, and get into nature. The road here from Alleppey or Kochi is very windy! It takes about 4 hours from Kochi. We stayed at Vedanta hostel which are all over Kerala and a decent option. It was 350 Rs. per night. They did forget to do my laundry, then try to pretend like it was clean but in the end I didn’t have to pay and it was fine. For food, we tried Kuttanadu for local and the beef stew was SO GOOD! For western food, we hit up the pricey Cardomom Country  which had really good pizza and burgers and a swimming pool! The hotel looked amazing here.  Our Place is meant to have the best pizza but they were closed when we stopped by. The lady who owned it was really nice. I think she was English. She offered to make us anything we missed from home, even off the menu, when they opened that evening but we weren’t there to try it. You can ride elephants here but I don’t think it’s good as they are there only for tourists, are tortured to be as tame as they are, and unlike places like Dubare in Karnataka, they aren’t there for working in the forrest. Seeing the martial arts show was the coolest bit . My Kovalam friends call it “Keralan dance fighting” and it’s very unique – a must see! One second they are doing cartwheels and acting tame, the next a guy is tackled and pretending to have his head cut off, all to the tune of music. There’s also fire. Amazing.  The cost here is 200 Rs.  In the National Park you can trek, camp, and take boat safaris. We did a trek for 450 Rs. &amp; bamboo boat safari. On the trek, they give you covers for your legs as pictured. Absolutely wear them to protect from leeches. The bamboo rafting was okay because we saw a wild mama elephant and her baby, but if you were unlucky to see nothing, it’s pricey at 1,500 Rs. There are government prices that cannot be negotiated. The trek lasted about 1.5 hours there and 1.5 back with the boat ride in between. A packed lunch was included and one water per person. Abraham’s Spice Plantation is available and was part of the goMowgli tour. The girls loved it, I skipped to catch up on work &amp; because I’ve seen about 10 by now.  The cost is 200 Rs. If you’re going to be adventurous in India, do get travel insurance.  I use World Nomads which is what Lonely Planet recommends 4. MUNNAR The hill stations in the tea fields are really popular in Kerala, like everything else on this list. We actually went to Chinnakanal which is 20 km East of Munnar and escaped all the crowds. Read more about seeing the Kerala tea plantations here. On the road, make sure to try a traditional Indian coffee house to get a dosa and chai! I also had a tasty omelette. On the road between Munnar &amp; Varkala we stopped at  Aranmula Parthasarathy which is a temple that probably doesn’t have tourist bus access. It was one of the offbeat things goMowgli offered and was very cool. We were lucky enough to see the procession where each day for a month a different village is represented at the temple and shows up on a Keralan boat putting on a show for the crowd. It’s something not a lot of people will get to see! This temple is one of 108 that Hindu’s are meant to visit and it was neat to walk around the town as well. The tradition is over 1,000 years old. The other place we stopped with goMowgli was a little mirror shop,  unique in the fact they are the ONLY family left who makes mirrors this way, out of all metal. It was really cool to watch them work. If you want the perfect souvenir, this is it, and when you see how much work is put into it, 2,000 Rs. for a small one is a steal. 5. KOVALAM Kovalam is the top beach hangout and the closest you’ll get to Goa in Kerala. It’s a chilled out place but to be honest if you are spending a lot of time in Goa, my opinion is you can skip here. I’ve stayed a week in the past and wrote about it here: Kovalam beach tips . The best things to do in Kovalam to me is body surf on the huge waves and have half off sunset drinks at the Leela, which has the best view in town. 6. THIRUVANANTHAPURAM  (Trivandum) I am only mentioning this as a hub that you can fly in and out of and will maybe be your point of destination on the way to Kovalam if you go by train. The big thing to see here is the  Padmanabhaswamy Temple, the richest place of worship in THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, according to the Wikipedia page. Only Hindus can go inside. 7. VARKALA I loved Varkala &amp; wrote all about it on this article: Adventure sports in Varkala . It’s definitely a hotspot on the tourist trail, and is full of hippie backpackers surfing and partying the nights away. This is my favorite green bikini from L*space which is my go-to brand for sporty stuff! Turn on your JavaScript to view content 8. WAYANAD This is somewhere I haven’t been, but it didn’t feel right to not mention. It’s on my “must go” list in India mainly because there are treehouses in the jungle. There are indigenous tribal people living here, it’s high altitude in the Western Ghats, and is the least population region of Kerala. It borders Tamil Nadu &amp; Karnataka and I actually saw a glimpse when I was in Karnataka at the Kabini River Jungle Lodge."https://hippie-inheels.com/complete-guide-traveling-karnataka-9-hotspots/,india,"Complete Guide to Traveling in Karnataka &amp; 9 Hotspots I am BLOWN away by Karnataka. For some reason, tourists just don’t spend much time traveling in Karnataka. Backpackers pop over to Hampi (the mysterious boulders) or maybe a trip to Jog Falls and that’s about it. Even Indian nationals were saying,  “holy cow is that REALLY in India!?”  on comments of my Karnataka photos. Karnataka is kind of this undiscovered state when it comes to international tourism… which means you should get your little booty here asap! I traveled the ENTIRE state for one month with goMowgli and learned so much, so without further ado, here is a little guide to the Indian state of Karnataka. You’ll have here a quick guide to karnataka, 9 hotspots to visit, and my favorite hotels in Karnataka. All have links to full posts that share more in depth information. Quick Guide to Traveling in Karnataka Location: Karnataka is coastal below Goa, above Kerala and goes inland to reach Andhra Pradesh. It also go up to border with Maharashtra. Language: Kannada Overview: Karnataka is known for many things like it’s Hoysala Empire, Chamundi Hills (where the story of Dashara comes from), Tiger reserves, Mysore’s royal kings, and silk and incense manufacturing. There are tropical beaches (the coast is one of the wettest areas in India), jungles (the Western Ghats, which are protected because of how many incredible animals live and flora grow there), ancient caves, and some of the oldest temples in the entire world. At one point Karnataka ruled all of India! It also has Asia’s largest population of elephants. Currency: Indian rupee Food:  I’ve written a post dedicated to this: Guide to South Indian Food … enjoy because it’s all drool-worthy. Getting there &amp; away: You can book a flight into Banagalore and take a train or bus anywhere you want. Traffic in Bangalore is terrible. If you are in Mysore and want to fly, it’s cheaper to bus to Bangalore. The buses in Karnataka are known as some of the best in India (although mine broke down once) and my train trips in 2AC were clean and safe. Karnataka is well connected, but in rural areas you’ll have to take crowded locals buses unless you hire a car our join a tour. Mangalore is a huge travel hub, and Hubli is another huge hub (and not worth spending a day in). Solo Female Travel:  I was on a tour, so rarely totally alone, but I found Karnataka safe. Many of the best places are very rural though, so I wouldn’t suggest traveling alone at night. Make sure you book ahead in rural areas and have someone meet you at bus stations. In Karnataka, dress appropriately. Places NOT TO MISS in Karnataka 1. Coorg Land of filter coffee, cozy homestays, secret waterfalls, and homemade Kodova wine… this is my favorite place in Karnataka, and one of my favorite in India. Deep in the Western Ghats are teh Kodova people who are meat-eating, nature-worshipping, warriors. They can even carry their traditional knives. Loved 4-wheel driving in the Ghats, checking out a small Tibet town, and trekking to the second tallest peak in Karnataka. The Dubare elephant camp is here, and is a great place to bathe elephants. Don’t miss: eating pandi curry. Also See: Bathing Elephants at Dubare Elephant Camp Touring Coorg | Thadiyandamol &amp; Iruppu Falls  Backpacking Coorg | Chikli Hole, Bylakuppe &amp; Mandalpatti  11 Kick-ass Things to do in Coorg (coming soon!) 2. Mysore Mysore is the Royal city of Karnataka. The market is the most organized I’ve ever seen in India. Picture streets green and clean like Bangalore, but with less people. It’s a cozy place considering what a big city it is. Key sights: watching artists, going up to Chumundi Hill, and seeing lights at Royal palace. This is the place to try yoga and Ayurveda as lots of westerners move here to dedicate their lives to the practice. Don’t miss: eating Mysore Pak Also See: Mysore Art &amp; Meeting the local Artisans 7 Must-Do’s in Mysore Your Mysore Shopping Guide Finding the Best Food in Mysore | 8 Mysore Restaurants  3. Around Mysore If you only have time for one city, Mysore is the place because there are day trips you can take to experience so much more. There is a crocodile sanctuary nearby, a nearby reservation to see tigers and leopards, many ancient temples, Bahubali the largest monolithic statue in India, and small religious towns, massive waterfalls, and you can visit BR Hills to see even more wild cats &amp; meet locals tribals. Also See: 8 Day Trips from Mysore Tailoring Clothes in India | Khaddi Cotton Tour in Melukote   Jungle Safari with Kabini River Jungle Lodge 4. Hampi Hampi of course is the ultimate place for tourists to go in Karnataka. I will take my parents there when they visit this year, and I’ve already been there 3 times myself. It’s stunning, you can stay in little cabins looking over rice paddy fields, ride bikes around to the resevior, see ancient temples, and check out the mysterious boulders along the river. You can even watch the temple elephant be bathed. Getting here you can take a train to hospet and rickshaw to Hampi. Also See: 8 Things to do in Hampi Bear Watching at the Sloth Bear Resort Near Hampi Guide to Hampi | Second Time in Hampi Taking my parents to Hampi 5. Around Hampi People come and go from Hampi without checking out the nearby UNESCO Heritage sites! Crazy! Make sure to take time for a tour (or you can hire a car). Nearby are Aihole and Pattadakal built by the Chalukya in the 4th and 5th centuries. There are 100’s of temples here. It’s some of the oldest stuff you can see in India. Driving through the villages and rural areas here is an event of it’s own and it’s great to take time and get out to take photos and meet local kids. The Badami caves are also a day trip from Hampi and are very intriguing and ancient. The hotels here are scarce and had terrible amenities and food. Bring snacks! Also See: Aihole and Pattadakal |100’s of barely visited temples Why You’ve Got to See the Badami Cave Temples 6. Coastal Karnataka Worth a visit, but not as good as Goa (Ashwem, Little Vagator, Keri beach) or Kerala (Varkala, Kovalam). Karwar was beautiful because it was empty and pristine- but there wasn’t much to do there plus you have to drive into town to find a restaurant and the roads aren’t easier. I also didn’t see many scooter rentals. Gokarna is popular thanks to Om beach because shaped like “om” but personally, I found it dirty, the food terrible, and I was constantly bothered by domestic toursits with their cameras and even video recording me. Most girls there (both Indian and foreign) discussed not feeling comfortable in a swimming suit. You can also head down to Murudeshwar to see the second biggest Shiva statue in the world . 7. Dandeli and nearby areas Dandeli was a cute little forrest area. There are tons of homestays as it’s a popular place for people from Maharashtra to come visit on their holidays. If you take a small holiday within India, this is a great spot to go for a weekend getaway. It’s all about nature, hiking, relaxing, and a little bit of adventure sports on the river. Also See: 8 Adventures in Dandeli, Your Jungle Weekend Getaway 8. Chikmagalur This is another very popular domestic tourist destination in India. There are lots of homestays and they are QUITE pricey. Funnily enough, domestic tourists usually pay more for a room than backpackers because backpackers are on tight budgets, while domestic tourists save up for this big trip and can spend more – therefore they are charged more. This area is therefore pricey. Homestays will run up to 2,000 rs per night (without food), whereas in Coorg they were closer to 1,000 (food included). Just near Gokarna heading to Chikmagalur, is Banavasi temple. You can see this temple and Jog Falls in the same day. The temple is one of the coolest I’ve seen in India and it’s not even in the guidebooks! Jog Falls are the second biggest falls in India. In this region you’ll do lots of treks (to the tallest peak in Karnataka at 6,300 feet), see great views, find secret waterfalls, and try amazing food at cozy homestays. I also thought that the temples in this area were insanely cool!

(coming soon) Birding Boat Ride at River Tern 9. Bangalore The best place to come and go from in Karnataka if you are flying. This is the biggest city full of expats, traffic, IT industry, big city life, great food, and all the amenities and 5 star hotels you could ask for. I’ve been a couple times, but haven’t spend more than a weekend at a time. Nh7 Bangalore was hosted here but it’s not as good as the Pune one. See Also: Getting my Western Fix in Bangalore, India Luxury Guide to Bangalore, India Favorite Hotels and Homestays in Karnataka I stayed at a lot considering I spent a month in the state, so I won’t list them all here- just the ones that really stand out. In all my posts on Karnataka, I mention each place I’ve stayed so the information is there. Here are my favorites: Dhyan’s Den in Coorg  – cozy homestay, amazing family Green Hotel in Mysore – an actual palace &amp; you can stay in princess rooms Indus Valley Ayervedic Center (IVAC)- most famous in all of India River Kabini Jungle Lodge in Kabini – just outside Mysore, good chance of seeing wild cats Gorukana in BR Hills – luxury cabins in the jungle, amazing spot Gundimane near Jog Falls – extremely nice family, cozy rooms, and great food Shanthi Guesthouse in Hampi – take a room facing the water I went on a month-long tour sponsored by goMowgli, and suggest that if you want to see all of the above! It was stressfree and easy."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-jaipur/,india,"Luxury Guide to Jaipur Welcome to Backpacker’s Boutique.

A Luxury Guide to Jaipur Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Jaipur. Hi! My name is Lydia and I’m the blogger behind My Culture Craving – a blog, which focuses on travel, food and culture. Just over a week ago I left the UK to pursue my one-way trip of a lifetime to South India (I’m currently in Goa), New Zealand and beyond. A couple of years ago I took part in a volunteering project for 6 weeks in Jaipur (this is where my love for this ecentric country stemmed from). Although the guesthouse we stayed in was hospitable and comfortable, we were always on the look out for different places with a spot of luxury to eat, shop and relax… especially when it would get as hot as 40 something degrees! From hunting down a luxurious hotel with access to a pool to finding a cute restaurant with fresh, yummy food and a great ambience, we became pros at finding the glamorous corners of this city. What makes Jaipur a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Jaipur (also known as The Pink City) is seeped in outstanding architecture, luxurious hotels and shopping second-to-none! What more could you want for a glam trip? Hawa Mahal, credit:   Jean-Pierre Dalbéra What luxury hotel is the best in Jaipur? On my second trip to India I was travelling with my Mum so inevitably, she wanted to check out the best of the best luxury hotels in Jaipur. We ended up discovering Shahpura House Hotel , an outstandingly beautiful hotel, which boasted Maharaja inspired decor and extremely attentive staff. With a pool, rooftop restaurant and spa, it offered everything you could ever want from an indulgent stay yet, with a stunning splash of cultural decor. What about boutique hotels in Jaipur, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? When I was volunteering, we found a gem of a boutique hotel and restaurant not far from the city centre – Peacock Rooftop Restaurant in Hotel Pearl Palace . Although I never stayed at the hotel myself, I did recommend it to a couple of friends who could only sing its praises. The rooftop restaurant was beautiful and offered scrummy Indian dishes, friendly staff and a great atmosphere so, a trip here is definitely worth it even if it’s only for the delicious food. Hot Air Balloon Ride in Jaipur, credit:  Arun Katiyar Are there any fun activities for travellers to do whilst in Jaipur? Along with Jaipur’s vast selection of incredible sights, I would recommend all travellers to go and watch a Bollywood film at The Raj Mandir cinema. Looking like a giant pink, fluffy meringue from the outside, this cinema is a sight in itself and gives you a great chance to watch a Bollywood movie in all its glory. Jal Mahal, credit:  Arian Zwegers Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? India is renowned for its creamy lassis served in cute terracotta pots and Indian sweets of all types and flavours. Therefore, I would recommend delving into one of these (or both) as a dessert. There are sweet shops throughout the Pink City so, I would advise finding a shop and picking a random selection of sweets to try. They also serve them in adorable, small boxes, which are perfect for a dessert on the go whilst doing a spot of shopping… City Palace Hal, credit:  Paul Asman and Jill Lenoble Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Jaipur. Jaipur is a shopaholics paradise. The Pink City is overflowing with shops and stalls selling everything from intricately embroidered clothing and handmade leather satchels (I bought one of these on my first trip to India and it is still going strong) to bright, sparkling bangles and extravagant, colourful saris. Jaipur is famous for it’s gem emporiums, which sell great value jewellery and allow you to watch as diamonds and precious stones are shaped and polished before getting the chance to admire, try on and buy (only if you want to) their finest jewellery – just be sure to know that what you are buying is legit before making a purchase. The city also has an amazing selection of textile factories where you can watch as clothes and textiles are dyed, printed and embroidered. If you want to look extra glamorous and unique on your travels, you can also get items of clothing custom made at these factories. What are the best attractions in Jaipur? Jaipur is overflowing with sights from a bygone era. Begin your day by roaming around the majestic, pink Hawa Mahal and opulent City Palace, uncovering a new historic cubbyhole around every corner you explore. Then head to Jantar Mantar to learn about the fascinating details of the world’s largest stone sundial. A little further out of the city you will find the Galta Monkey Temple. Not only appealing for the huge number of cheeky monkeys that roam the grounds but also for the intricately decorated temples and emerald coloured pools, which are nestled between the imposing mountain ranges on either side, it is a great spot to go to, to get out of the city and absorb some tranquillity. Where can you find the best food in Jaipur? Around a half an hour tuk tuk ride outside of the city lies Chokhi Dhani – an ethnic village showcasing the best of Rajasthani culture. From women dancing across glass with a crazy number of pots on their heads to snake charmers and puppet shows, it is an eclectic experience for all of the senses. However, the real star of the show is the feast, which comes with your ticket. A divine thali flaunting Rajasthani food at its finest. Curry, dal, curd, rice, lassi and breads of all kinds, it was one of the best meals I had in India albeit, a spicy one. The village may feel a little commercialised but it is definitely still worth going to just for the food. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Amer Fort is situated around half an hour from Jaipur’s centre and is a breathtaking spot to watch the sunset. With its uninterrupted, panoramic views across the city, countryside and beyond and with the opulent fort as your backdrop, it would be hard to find a better, more peaceful place to watch the sun disappear behind the milky horizon."https://hippie-inheels.com/places-to-visit-in-jaipur/,india,"Places to Visit in Jaipur for the Trendy Traveler: Iconic Landmarks, Trendy Bars, and the Best Shopping India’s pink city, Jaipur, is officially one of my favorite cities in the world and all it took on this second visit was being there with someone who knew the place like a local. Now that I see the other side (not the backpacker’s side ) of Jaipur, I’m hooked!

You can usually average about 1,000 Rs. per hour journey then negotiate that rate down. It’s technically by km, but this is just an easy way to do it in your head. The main highways are in good condition so road travel is relatively fast. Getting around: Uber &amp; rickshaws I took a few rickshaws when it was a short distance, but I overwhelmingly used Uber for my travel in Jaipur. It’s so much easier and there are tons of Uber’s around so not much wait time. Here are some tips for Uber in India. Best Hotels in Jaipur Samode Haveli I spent a few nights at Samode Haveli which is the top boutique hotel in Jaipur and it’s located in the perfect spot. With luxurious rooms, kind staff, and the most incredible architecture you can imagine, it’s my favorite place to stay in Jaipur. Prices aren’t currently listed and range from the type of room to the time of year that you come. Jaipur is the place in India to splurge a bit, and this is the best place to do it. I’ve written a full review  about the two Samode properties listed here Haveli above and Palace, the next one Check availability, review, and current rates for Samode Haveli Samode Palace Samode Palace is outside Jaipur about 30 km away and I recommend staying here if you want to see a real palace built into the wilderness. I’ve never stayed anywhere as luxurious and unique as this. Prices aren’t currently listed. This palace is a real palace owned by the past Maharaja of the area. They still come for visits! While this is outside of town only 30 km, that takes over an hour so I suggest staying here as well as Samode Haveli in Jaipur before as you won’t want to taxi back and forth. Check availability, review, and current rates for Samode Palace Shahpura House This hotel also is done in authentic Maharajas style. It has a pool, rooftop restaurant, and is a perfect boutique hotel. Rooms range from 3,000 Rs to 11,000 Rs. This is a mid-range property. Check availability, review, and current rates for Shahpura House Hotel Pearl Palace This adorable boutique hotel has a popular restaurant, the Peacock Rooftop Restaurant. This is a budget property and goes for around 2,000 Rs per night. Check availability, review, and current rates for Hotel Pearl Palace Zostel Zostel is a chain hostel group in India that tries to match European style hostel standards. Travelers rave about Zostel in Jaipur and although I haven’t been, I will vouch for it as so many of my trusted friends have stayed. Rooms as low as 400 Rs. per night in a shared dorm. Check availability, review, and current rates for Zostel Things to do in Jaipur as a Tourist &amp; Places to Visit in Jodhpur How long should you stay in Jaipur?  I would stay around 3 days as a traveler who is going all around India for months. If you are on a short two-week trip, then I suggest staying two days. You can see all the top attractions in that time but won’t have a lot leftover for shopping which is a main reason to come here. Hawal Mahal This is the most epic pink building in the city and it’s where the royal women used to watch the street parades – and was built for just that reason. Jaipur is known as the pink city like Jodhpur is the blue city , but it’s not for a real reason. It was said to be done to impress the Queen when she visited and now it’s the law to stay pink. The name means “Palace of the winds”. It’s right next to City Palace so you can visit them at the same time. It’s 50 Rs. City Palace This is located in the center of the city. Jaipur is India’s first “planned city” and it was built with infrastructure in mind. It’s now a museum and is 150 Rs. to enter. It’s open only 10 am – 5 pm. Jantar Mantar Here you’ll find the world’s largest stone sundial. There are 19 instruments there built in 1734 that allow you to see astronomical positions with the naked eye. If you’re into science, it’s a do-not-miss. Read more about it here . Amber Fort (Amer Fort) This is a 10 km drive and with panoramic views across the city and countryside, it’s even better to see at sunset. To reach, take a rickshaw from the city center. The king lived here with 12 of his wives back in the day – and 350 mistresses. Busy guy! There are elephant rides here. Don’t do them! It’s torture how the elephants are treated. 300 Rs. There is also the Jaigarh Fort which was built to protect the Amber Fort which you can see while there at an additional fee. Galta Monkey Temple This is also outside the city, but I still remember this temple from 5 years ago on my first visit, so it’s something that really stands out and worth a visit, especially if you have never been to a monkey temple. It’s kind of in the hills and has multiple temples in a complex. This “Galti Ji” site is a place people come on pilgrimage for its natural water springs and the Ramgopalji temple. Free to enter. Some people might just call this Hanuman’s temple. Jal Mahal In the middle of Man Sagar Lake, you’ll see this beautiful palace floating (a little romantic Udaipur vibe). Only half is still floating and the bottom half is submerged. You can’t go into this beautiful sandstone palace though and have to view it from the other side of the lake. Nahargarh Fort Built in 1734, this fort gives a huge sweeping view over the entire city of Jaipur. Check out a Bollywood film at The Raj Mandir Cinema The theatre is beautiful and seeing a Bollywood film while you are in North India is the best time to do this. It’s an experience as the movie-watchers get really into here and jump up and yell and are totally entertaining. Visit the Iconic Stepwell Like Jodhpur , there are stepwells here and actually, the Jaipur ones are incredibly famous and a photographer’s dream. You can see ladies during laundry, people bathing, and kids playing in the well. You can read more about these here . Restaurants in Jaipur Palladio Cafe – This is the best of the best for lunch in Japuir. It’s meant to be mostly Lebanese, but you’ll find just about anything on the menu and it’s healthy western food. The cafe is one of the cutest buildings in Jaipur! Taruveda  – This super cute cafe has the best paninis and crepes in town. Sujan – Sujan is one of the most well-known hotel brands in Jaipur and is PURE luxury. The price of a meal for two here could easily by over 10,000 Rs once you add the many taxes. It’s beautiful from photos, but I haven’t eaten here. Anokhi Cafe  – This is inside the shop Anokhi and has all organic food, grown by the owners. They do pizza, salads, and pasta. You can at least stop for a drink to take a break from shopping! I had the margarita pizza and it was tasty. OTH (On The House) – This is a European style cafe with a menu that covers just about every type of Western food from nachos to pasta. Niros – This is the best place for a true North Indian feast at the lowest price possible. If you are on a budget and want to pig out on the best Indian food around, come here. Spice Court – While they have dishes from all over North India, they are known for their spicy Rajasthani dishes. It’s a great place to eat local food at a cheap price. Jaipur Modern Kitchen – Really tasty intercontinental food (meant to be solely Italian) like pasta, pizzas, and sandwiches as well as starters from Europe and the USA. Chokhi Dhani – touristy but cool ethnic village showcases Rajasthani food and dance, puppet shows, and even snake charmers. It’s commercialized but does serve good authentic local food. Going Out for Parties in Jaipur Shikaar Bagh – A new addition to the going out scene in Jaipur, this is located right next to Bar Palladio so you can go to both in one night. The music was awful lounge music but there were tons of expats here and young local people. Some women had on sarees and others were in leather trousers – everything seems to go here. Free to enter. Bar Palladio – You can come here early for sunset drinks and dinner with their Italian menu. It’s pricey and a really pretty place to hang out. Free to enter. Polo Bar – The rooftop bar has indoor soundproof area and a had full-on trance party while I was there. For me it was surprising, but the local friends we went out with said it’s the norm. Depending on the party there could be a cover charge. Club Naila – Does after parties, I was meant to end my night here for some pool party but was too tired by 3 AM when everyone wanted to go. They charge a cover charge. Blackout – A upscale bar with views but you might have to pay a 1,000 Rs cover to get in. The Dragon Club – This is a really popular party place for young people to eat, drink, listen to music, and dance late into the night. There is a cover charge. Shopping in Jaipur (most mentioned are fixed price) Anokhi – I loved this shop and got some keychains and a bag here. Anohki is known for block-printing and they are in the museum at the Amber Fort if you want to go learn how. Prices are higher than export shops but they also have some nicer stuff. They have adult Indian-style clothing, cute kids clothes, and homewares. There is a cafe inside. Tokree – This is a fashion shop for men and women which has Indian clothing but you can still pop in for some scarves and adorable knickknacks. Many people like to wear Indian clothing while traveling here, and this would be a trendy place to stock up. Soma – Soma is all about block-printing which is a famous technique from Jaipur (but used all over the world I think). You can buy clothing, accessories, and homewares here. Concept French Jewelry – This is a shop run by the designer, Diane Singh, who’ve I’ve gotten to know through friends. Her gold-plated and silver jewelry is designed so well that I bought 14 pieces and spent over 20,000 Rs. here. It’s fixed price which makes jewelry shopping a lot less stressful, (clearly, since I was relaxed enough to spend a fortune, lol). mom: one of these is for you… hmmm, which one!? Hot Pink – This store has housewares and clothing. It’s very cute and well-curated. Don’t miss stopping in here! Located inside Narain Niwas complex. Narain Niwas – Hot Pink is located inside the complex of the Narain Niwas Palace Hotel. There are a couple other shops here that I did not mention like Anataya Decor (stunning homewares, but so pricey), Umrao Jewels, and Andraab, among others. This is also where Bar Palladio is so you can come here and do some shopping and have dinner. Shops close early here, I think by 7 pm. Jaipur Modern – This is at the restaurant Jaipur Modern Kitchen and you’ll find contemporary bags, scarves, bedding, homewares, and jewelry. It’s a great place to shop all around. This is located in C-Scheme Teatro Dhora – You can buy unique contemporary jewelry with a Rajasthani influence; great combo. It’s gorgeous pieces, some of which have been in CN Traveler but you can also find affordable gold-plated items at around 2,000 Rs. This shop has clothing and accessories, too. Hawa Mahal Street – You can shop around the main market here for fabric, silver, gold, and gems. Jaipur has great pottery and beaded slippers. You’ll find all the regular tourist items here too that I mentioned above but usually not as nice of quality and you’ll have to haggle a lot. Kripal Kumbh – Jaipur is known for a specific blue pottery and this is the best place to buy it. Gem Palace – This place is famous for it’s jewelry but it’s expensive so I didn’t even go inside. If you have a lot to spend on jewelry and want solid gold and gemstones, you can go here for a trusted place to shop. Most of the homewares places that I have mentioned so far for where to shop in Jaipur are on the pricey side because they are in a curated shop. You can buy these items in export shops if you feel like digging through for some gems. I’m going to share the best shops I went to for cheap finds below (not cheap things, but the cheapest you’ll get nice things). The friend I was with has been shopping from these same people for years on wholesale prices and knows them well. While on Instagram stories, I showed you the export houses, I can’t give out that information – I will give you their showroom addresses instead. The owners of these shops know that I’m blogger and that readers will come from this blog post, so if you say you came because you’ve read about them on “Hippie in Heels” – they promise they will give you a fair price that does not need to be negotiated down ( not wholesale but fair ). AKA they won’t try to rip you off. It’s worth a shot! BR Enterprises 29-C, Govind Nagar West Amer Road, Near Jorawar Singh Gate This is a smaller shop but with a focus on block-printed fabric like sarongs and robes, and amazing quilts. I got both of those things, plus a few pieces of fabric to make my own stuff. He can also order in other designs or colors if you don’t see what you want. Vimla International Gupta Garden, Near Brahmpuri Police Station, Amer Road Rugs galore! I mean really, don’t by a rug anywhere other than here. I waited to come here until the day before I went to the palace and had already spent way past my shopping budget on jewelry at Diane’s shop but ended up buying five rugs, as one does when encountered with a room full of the prettiest rugs you’ll ever see at the lowest price you will probably ever find. You climb over piles of rugs to get to the ones you want! Ridhi Sidhi Textiles 9, Govind Nagar East, Amber Palace Road  This place has everything. They customize and design these items for huge brands who sell them at way higher prices. They have the cutest sarongs and lungis, quilts, sheets, huge Rajasthani-style duvets, textiles to make your own clothes, and more. I spent about 10k in here buying a mix of bedding, sarongs, and fabric I’ll make clothing with. It’s hard to keep track of all the prices if you are buying a lot and you’ll see I wasn’t the only crazy foreigner with a paper and pen writing it down to see what I could afford, haha! Saurashtra Impex 7-8 Inside Jorawar Singh Gate, Opp. Ayurveda College, Amer Palace Road You will also find rugs here as well as sheets, bags, and textiles. This place is huge and has a couple floors to explore. You can get a huge variety of quilts, wool shawls and blankets (like REALLY nice blankets), and traditional pieces of Rajasthani mirrorwork."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2015/04/budget-save-india-tour/,india,"8 Ways to Save While Traveling In India Traveling to a foreign country gives you a lot of exciting and amazing experiences but it can also cause you to spend more than what you planned. If you are visiting India, here are some important tips on how to save while exploring. 1. Save on flights. 2 .0 Neither much in advance nor waiting ’til the last moment is advisable as you make your flight booking. You also need to remember that Fridays and Sundays are busiest and hence can be pretty expensive days to travel by flight. Hence, it is best suggested to be flexible with the dates so that you can have your tickets booked for a much lower price. Consider traveling during off-season to get the best deal. 2. Opt for trains where available.  Train journeys in India are less expensive. Though it can be challenging to many, it can also be a lot of fun. This is one of the best ways to get closer to the soul of the country. By flying to and from various destinations, you not only pay more but also see less of the country you are touring. Trains in India connect you to most of the places and where train services are not available, you can always get down at the nearest station and seek other public transport or hire a cab. 3. Eat well for a lower price. Sounds tempting? Book your accommodation in hotels that offer special discounts on meals for their guests. Some hotels offer you free breakfast. Of course, there is really nothing ‘free’ in the business world but you definitely get it for a better price. 4. Bargain: your shopping mantra. Never hesitate to bargain. Even shops that have a ‘No Bargain’ board hanging near the cash counter may be willing to relax their rule for a while if you really do it right. Most of the shops, though, love to engage in bargaining. In shopping bazaars you can really bargain quoting half the price. However, it may not work out all the time but at least you did not lose anything for trying, right? 5. Carrying food helps your health and wallet. You sure would have chosen a decent hotel to stay during your holiday. However, as you travel to different travel destinations in India , you may not always land in the right restaurant to have your meals. Hence, it is best suggested to carry your food with you. This will help you save a good deal of money. 6. Compare rates. While planning to tour different travel destinations in India, compare rates offered by various travel agents. Go for the best rate after ensuring that the quality of services is equally great too. There are many online sites that give information on the rates of various travel packages. Choose the best after studying reviews by users, which serve as a yardstick to measure the travel agents’ services. 7. Rent a bike. Bike rentals are readily available in certain parts of India. You can avoid car rentals and seek to hire bikes for a local trip. 8. Get friendly with the locals. Getting friendly with locals helps you get valuable information on almost everything from great but unpopular tourist destinations to how to save money while you are there. Having a reliable local person to guide you will help cut down costs considerably. You will be guided to the best shopping place and to the best shops that offer quality products for reasonable price."https://hippie-inheels.com/little-weekend-guide-bangalore/,india,"My Little Weekend Guide to Bangalore This was my third trip to Bangalore, a city I really like visiting for more modern vibes, after all our home in Goa is in a village in a jungle. I’ve shared a little about Bangalore so here are some tips if you are coming in for the weekend and want something a little more upscale plus want to do a few local things. My Little Guide to Bangalore Bangalore (newly renamed Bangaluru) is the capital of Karnataka, a state that I love and have spent more 6 weeks in total. I have written a lot of this state and the city of Bangalore so want to link a few of those here, as in this article I am focusing more a whirlwind weekend in Bangalore, if you only have a couple days to spare. My tips on Bangalore Luxury guide to Bangalore Ultimate guide to Karnataka Trying the Local South Indian food This is something that you don’t want to miss in Bangalore . Truly, you have to make this a priority. While you can walk in any little restaurant and get similar items, there are places that are  famous for the dishes of this region. I’ve written about South Indian food and why I love it so much with it’s freshness and coconut bases. VV Puram Street Start at VV Puram Street where you can walk down the road (it looks pedestrian but cars will go down it) and look at the food being made so you can choose what works best for you. I snacked on quite a lot, but shared with my buddy at the table. We had these potato spirals that had some serious spice on them, some fried pao you stuff with some masala and onion (my favorite), and a few other dishes you can see below. I really liked the akki roti which was full of dill, a flavor I really like. You’ll also find Chinese here, as you do all over India, and all the hot bhaji (fried stuff) you could want. Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR) MTR  is absolutely the most famous place to go for breakfast. You’ve got to get a dosa if you’ve never had one. If you order it “masala” then you’ll have a spiced aloo (potato) stuffed inside which is really tasty. It’s served with sambar and a chutney you can dip it in. Of course you can order other things here like rava Idli and what I call “Indian donuts”. You have to get the coffee though. I shared on Instagram stories how the server poured it back and forth between two cups, perfecting it. This place is crowded even when I got there at 730 AM. Think about the traffic as well which will make you even later than you think. The wait is actually organized and you give your name to the man with the clipboard. It may look hectic, but you’ll be in and out of there in an hour.  For “moden” local food: Feast at Sheraton So Feast if the buffet at the Sheraton, but you can also order a la carte. The chef there is famous for his modern take on South Indian food. Typically, South Indian food is eating with your hands on a banana leaf. He changes up the style and makes it more of a fine dining experience. The chicken and prawn curry goes in my top 5 curries I’ve ever had in India. The dish above was a pan fried fish with pineapple and creamed spinach…. such an interesting combination and so delicious. You have to order it. Dessert was a coconut version of my fave, lava cake. Take in the Nightlife Bangalore has always been known for it’s 11 pm curfew, which was a bummer in the past. These days, that has been lifted a little bit and I’m told it’s now 2 am. I couldn’t find an article to verify this. Regardless, the 5 star hotels and clubs they own are allowed to stay open past curfew so often that’s where people head for a great night out. High Ultra Lounge High Ultra Lounge is the highest building in all of South India, at 30 stories in the air on top of the World Trade Center. The views are incredible. There are a few different rooms, which have different vibes. One is more family friendly for dinner, another is like a lounge for dinner, and then you have the club style room where you have private tables and dining. With an Aussie master cocktail instructor, you get some really cool drinks here. Actually, I haven’t had such crazy drinks before. One came out with smoke sitting on ice and rose petals, another was some ball sitting in jager which was injected with vodka via a syringe, then there was a whiskey drink they poured green tea on while serving. The hooka was really cool and you can pick and change up the flavors. I’m pretty sure it was the same as they had at the Persian Terrace restaurant at the Sheraton which they called the Rolls Royce of hooke; it’s flavored with champagne. If you’re not keen on nightlife, you can come here for brunch and views. I had dinner here and the chef, who is from Burma, made some really tasty dishes. Definitely order the chicken with the secret sauce. Shopping in Bangalore There are a lot of malls in Bangalore like UB (the fanciest) and Phoenix. Because I stayed in the Brigade Gateway, I checked out the mall there which was Orion. If you’re like me and live in India, this area is great to stay because the mall is on one side of the pond, the High Ultra Lounge is in this area, and because there is a 5 star hotel, school, and hospital, security is really good here so you’ll feel safe walking around within the Bridage Gateway. The Orion mall  had all the shops I wanted to see (there aren’t many in India): Zara, Forever 21, Mango, Aldo, Sephora, Starbucks, and don’t judge but Krispy Kreme. I didn’t buy anything though since I just came from the US and did my shopping there. If you want local things to buy you can go to MG road as well for more shopping. The city is full of places to pop in to buy anything you want. Spa In India, I get massages weekly. I have a masseuse who comes to my house. I’d been out of India for about 7 weeks and was dying for a massage! I think I’ve become addicted. I did the Shine massage at the Sheraton which was 90 minutes and there was jacuzzi time at the end (I didn’t have time to enjoy it though). The massage was perfect, a mix of Balinese and Swedish.. a little deep tissue too. I  almost fell asleep. Sightseeing If you’re here just the weekend chances are you won’t have a lot of time for that, but it’s okay because Bangalore isn’t really known for this. When you are at MTR getting your dosa in the morning, you can go to Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace &amp; Fort . Because of traffic, I recommend that you stay on this side of town for the day and go to VV Puram street for an early dinner since it’s just 15 minutes max from MTR. Where I recommend staying, the Brigade Gateway, is on the other side of town. You might want to also visit the Nandi Temple, Lal Bagh (gardens), and look at the ISKCON temple (Hare Krishna temple you cannot enter or take photos). You can actually see great views of this temple from High Ultra Lounge. Packing for Bangalore Bangalore is a modern city and you’ll see the local girls here wearing a huge variety of clothing. Jeans are definitely okay and fitted t-shirts as well. You can wear tank tops in my opinion and even a skirt which is knee length during the day if it’s not tight. For nightlife, the Indian girls were all in club dresses; they were short, tight, and low cut. You can probably wear whatever you want on a night out. I packed skinny jeans, cute high rise UGG tennis shoes, black sandals, a couple tank tops, a kaftan, and two dresses that came to just below my knees. I brought a jacket and sweater. The weather here is a bit nippy most of the year. How to dress in India You can use PackPoint  to get a totally detailed packing list. It is a service given for free from the Sheraton but you can use it for anywhere not just when you stay with them. You put in your dates, destination, and what you’ll be doing there and it tells you literally everything you need, even extra camera batteries. Where to stay in Bangalore I stayed in Bridage Gateway in the Sheraton Grand away from all the hustle and bustle, which is how I like it. In India’s bigger cities I always go for somewhere that has a little ease to it and has places nearby like a mall, restaurants, and nightlife that I can safely walk to. Outside the Orion Mall next to Sheraton Grand are lots of restaurants. This is also an expat area with apartments inside. Lots of business people from abroad go out here. I ate at the 4th floor Persian Terrace my first night and it was SO nice to have some meat! I can’t count how many kababs I had. I had some goat cheese with quinoa and a mezze platter to start. The kebabs were lamb, saffron lobster, and chicken. For dessert I had a fig and date date with icecream. I never knew I liked fig, but this was really tasty. This is a hang out place for sure, and you need to book ahead. It has the best views, a great bar, and a pool. The hookah, as I mentioned is the Rolls Royce of hookah and they call them smoking cocktails. You won’t find this style around India. The smoke is unfused with fresh fruit and alcohol, for example the champagne pearl which has champagne, strawberries, and grapes. They have 5 smoking cocktails on the menu. Try it out. I visited MTR, High Ultra Lounge, and VV Puram with Sheraton’s 1-hour gem program where they offer guidance to places nearby to get a great local experience. They also had something on offer called “paired” which was small tapas and wines/beers to match in the lobby bar. Bangalore is known for it’s craft beer scene and they match them up with Indian food so you can try a mixture of things. The rooms at the Sheraton I’ve been an SPG (preferred guest) since I stayed at the Sheraton in Maui. I also like W hotels who are under the same SPG umbrella. You can get upgrades and other benefits by signing up and it’s free. I was on a club floor (which means access to a club room that has snacks and drinks inside plus staff who will take a photo for you for Instagram lol). My room was really insane. I had to send Ben a Whatsapp video and make him feel bad he didn’t come along. He had been working in Maharashtra all week and was too tired to make the weekend trip. He was jealous, and a lot of it was because of the huge chunk of cheddar cheese on the bar haha. Champagne Breakfast I had to head out on Sunday so had a nice breakfast before doing so in the club room on my floor. I didn’t do the buffet but instead ordered the Champagne brunch, because who doesn’t want that? It was 5 courses, and my favorite thing was the spinach and corn pastry, and the quiche! One course was frozen yogurt with fruit and champagne poured on it but I put the photo on Instagram stories and forgot to download it. Dessert was so good; I’m going to try and get Ben to attempt to make it. It was a green apple sorbet with cornflakes and chocolate syrup…. seriously, the best thing I had all weekend!"https://hippie-inheels.com/my-little-guide-to-jodhpur-indias-blue-city/,india,"My Little Guide to Jodhpur, India’s Blue City: The Best Places for Photography and the Perfect Haveli in the Old City Did you know India has its very own “Blue City”? It does! Jodhpur, in Rajasthan. I’ve been here years ago as a backpacker and wrote some tips in this article  but I recently revisited less on a backpackers budget and more on a mid-range budget. I came for fun but also to do research and see what has changed in Jodhpur since I last visited. I wanted to find the best restaurants, a hotel you guys can afford that is also cute with views, and a few new places to shop. I found all that and more! Guide to Jodhpur, India’s Blue City Shop the top here This isn’t the only blue city I’ve visited; I’ve also visited Chefchaouen in Morocco which is totally different. While in Morocco it’s clearly all painted and every single inch is blue and “new” looking – in India, it’s very faded different shades of blue and the blue parts are only in one small part of Jodhpur, not the whole city (which is the second biggest city in Rajasthan). Why is it blue?  Like Morocco, the reasons vary but a lot of people will say that it keeps the temperature down and keeps mosquitos away. There is an incredible fort and palace here but the thing about Jodhpur that makes it SO worth visiting is the REALNESS of it in comparison to the rest of Rajasthan. Shop the top here I know that sounds crazy but let me try to explain: In Jaipur, it’s a huge city that is very modern, quite clean, and has great infrastructure. Everyone you meet there will speak English with you and you can pop into a huge variety of restaurants for food from all over the world. On the other hand, Udaipur is a tiny little town with a lake in the middle, easy to walk around, and very touristy. Jodhpur is neither of these. Jodhpur is a HUGE city but in a very small space, not with nice infrastructure like Jaipur, the capital. Jodhpur is like stepping back in time, it’s modern and you’ll have a hard time finding decent Western food here – which is usually an indicator of how touristy a place is. The Old City is jammed with people, cars can’t go in, and the bustling clock tower is so busy that even my friend Tia who grew up in South India and went to school here said she’d never been in a real Indian city like this before. It’s somewhere that will give you a sense of that Indian culture shock that we all get a kick out of but at the same time it’s small enough that if you walk around and get lost you can hop in a rickshaw and they’ll likely know your hotel or at least the area the hotel is in and help you find your way home for just a couple bucks. While in Jodhpur, you don’t need to think luxury – instead think eating Indian food with your hands, getting lost in the maze of blue buildings, photographing the amazing sights and people, seeing animals in the streets, and staying in a haveli from the 15th and 16th century. Before You Go to Jodhpur Don’t forget your visa! You can use  this link  to book it the easiest way for a fee. Read more about visas here . You’ll also want travel insurance. I use World Nomads ( follow this link for a quote ). Here’s my article on what is covered by WN insurance. For tours in Rajasthan, I recommend the USA company, G Adventures  and find one that goes the cities on your wishlist. Read my information about getting a SIM card in India or using Trabug . Getting To &amp; From Jodhpur + Getting Around Jodhpur Train/Bus to Jodhpur The option most travelers take who are going to see multiple places in the Indian state of Rajasthan is to travel by either train or bus. As a backpacker, I preferred bus (cheaper and more direct to the bus station usually right inside town). These days, I prefer A/C train journeys so I can watch a movie or something although the train stations are sometimes outside the city and then you need a taxi to your hotel. Here are tips on trains and buses in India . Either option is great for Jodhpur, but I took a taxi from Udaipur to save time. Flights to Jodhpur You can check  Kiwi.com  for flight options – I always use them for the best rates. You won’t want to fly in and out of Jodhpur from within Rajasthan though as it’s usually not direct and you have to go to Delhi between and it costs a load of money, where you could just drive for 5,000 rupees and get pretty much anywhere out of the tourist sites in 6-7 hours. Taxis in and out of Jodhpur I chose taxi from Udaipur to Jodhpur and Jodhpur onward to Jaipur because it just made sense money-wise and timewise. Basically, it was 3,500 to drive from Udaipur to Jodhpur with an agency I found on the street (read prices and booking information in my article about Udaipur ). Leaving from Jodhpur to Jaipur is about an hour longer and our hotel offered us a rate of 5,000 so we took that. A train would have been about 1,700 Rs for each of us (3,400 Rs) and taken much much longer. While there is a lot to see between Udaipur and Jodhpur to stay awake for, we left for the highway journey to Jaipur at 6 AM and slept through most of it. Getting around: Uber &amp; rickshaws You can use Uber anytime you go outside the city which we did for a visit to the Taj for pool time and to Gypsy restaurant. It’s so easy and you will likely meet your driver near the Clock Tower as they cannot drive into the Old City. Although Uber is here and easy, in the Old City you need to use rickshaws as the lanes are narrow and the cars can’t go in plus there is a complicated one-way system until 9 PM. Read more: everything you need to know about Uber in India *TIP* as always negotiate with the rickshaw driver who will likely quote double the cost. They will know “chowks” (the main square “market” or area of each zone) but they won’t know all restaurants and hotels even places that are so popular like RAAS, so it’s best to know what “chowk” you are going to and what chowk your hotel is in. That, they will understand! From there, they can ask a local to that area where the place is you are trying to find. I always have my google maps anyway and just tell the driver where to turn if I am feeling on top of things. Best Hotels in Jodhpur I did so much research about the hotel I wanted in Jodhpur and found the key in booking – get an average priced place but splurge for the suite! It’s the same thing we did in Udaipur. The buildings (havelis) in Rajasthan are so stunning and many were palaces so the rooms will be very different and if the place isn’t that popular they can’t put rates too high, so the suite will be the most expensive room in a not so expensive place. Blue House Guesthouse – $53 USD for the 100 sq. foot suite! A member of my India Travel Tips group actually told me about this (thanks!) and after checking it out, I was hooked on one specific room: the Jhankar Temple Suite. It was SO cute in photos and looked exactly the same when I arrived. This place is great for ALL budgets. A basic room here is just 1,750 Rs and the suite I got was 3,500 Rs per night. When you book make sure you clarify which room you want as technically all are called suites although on booking sites it will be tiered booking options “standard, deluxe, executive, and suite”. I emailed and called to verify I was getting the room I wanted. The Royal King Suite is also 3,500 which is cute too but I thought the Jhankar was the best. There are other rooms that are 2,400 and 2,900. The guesthouse when you walk in is not that impressive to be honest because it’s dark and cramped (not an area you’d want to hang out and have a coffee) but that feeling goes away as soon as you start chatting with the Jain family who own it. They were all so friendly and helpful during my whole stay. As we winding way way way up the stairs in the guesthouse we finally reached out suite and WOW it is imressive. The fact it’s just $53/night is a real steal. The room is ancient and you can just wonder what all has happened there in the 500 years it’s been there – even some movies have used this room for filming. There is an AMAZING view of the fort as well. We didn’t love the food and chose to eat out after trying the meals – not an issue though as you’ll be out exploring anyway. Plus, in general, we disliked almost all the food we tried in Jodhpur. More about that later. First, check out this cute room! The only downsides of the room were the A/C did not get very cold and would click on and off making it hard to sleep as we’d get really hot then cold then hot, you get the picture! The other thing is the bathroom had a hole in it for drainage on the floor near the sink which doesn’t look great – but I think was their only way to get the plumbing sorted. It’s a small bathroom but the room itself is huge. There is a TV although I didn’t try it. WiFi doesn’t reach all the way up to the room (same in almost all havelis in Jodhpur). Check rates, reviews, and book Blue House Jodhpur  (with that link) RAAS This is the most popular boutique hotel in Jodhpur and it’s often fully booked, as it was when I was there. Basic rooms start at $323 per night – and in Jodhpur because it’s a dusty chaotic city, I really wanted to stay in a room that was a nice escape and had a lot of character but I wasn’t ready to spend this much in Jodhpur for three nights (that is like a grand)… But, if you have the budget for the RAAS, there is nowhere else you should stay. I went there to check it out and it’s beyond beautiful and is in the perfect location by the stepwell. Read reviews and check availability here . Umaid Bhawan Palace (the Taj) The ultimate in luxury in Jodhpur, the Umaid Bhawan Palace is actually a palace and the hotel is one part of it, owned by the Taj Hotel Group. It’s around $700 per night and higher in the peak season (Dec/Jan). Check availability here . Vivanta by Taj There are Taj’s everywhere in India and I went to this one to use the pool for the day and the spa. They are the only place I could find that allow outside guests to use the pool for two hours for around 1,000 Rs. I also got a massage and it was something like 3,500 Rs – it was good. The hotel itself seemed a little bland, was really far outside of town and I’m pretty glad I didn’t stay there. While I usually love Taj hotels, this one wasn’t my favorite I’ve visited. It was good for coming to use the pool though! It was basically $65 for the day to use the pool and have an hour massage. Check rates and availability here . For another budget option, I also stayed at a haveli years back which is still there called Gouri Heritage Haveli which you can book here.  Back then it was 500 Rs but now it’s 2,000 for the cheapest room. You can compare their basic room with the basic rooms are Blue House and see which you prefer. Restaurants in Jodhpur Well, this is going to be a small section because we ate out 7 meals during our time in Jodhpur and only one was memorable. There were two others that were okay, but others that were “top ranked” online fell flat. Definitely don’t bother trying the western food here. Gypsy Dining Hall  – This place is AMAZING. This is outside of town and you’ll need to take an Uber but it’s so 1000% worth it. The thali is just amazing. Make sure you to upstairs where they serve the thali, not the downstairs restauarant. Every single bit of this meal was delicious. I think it was around 200 Rs and it was all you can eat – they just come around and fill it back up. This is the best place to go to try Dal Batti and get a sense of the local food. The Curry’s – Near RAAS, Stepwell, and all that popular stuff is a hostel called the Blue Turban and the reviews for this rooftop hostel restaurant were great so we popped in. It was decilious and was a great view of the fort at night, which was straight ahead. Stepwell – One of the most popular restaurants in Jodhpur. They have a very limited menu of basically an omelette, a pizza, and a cheese or chicken and cheese grilled sandwich, all of which are “okay” but good compared to Indian restaurants nearby trying to make the same things… They had very good coffee, cute ambiance, great A/C on a hot day, WiFi, and views of the stepwell outside. These are the same people who own RAAS. RAAS – we took a look at the menu at RAAS and after seeing my normally priced 100 Rs Goan fish curry rice at 900 Rs plus 28% taxes, we bounced. It was so overpriced (although luxury which I get) but we felt we could get good food elsewhere and since they also owned the Stepwell Cafe where we didn’t like the food, we figured we’d also be disappointed here but having spent more money. Had they allowed outside guests to use the pool, we would have done lunch here and tried it. At dinner when we came around 9 PM the restaurant was empty. There are others we tried and didn’t like so I won’t go into detail, except one: Indique , it’s rated VERY well, it’s very expensive, and it was maybe our worst meal, unfortunately. The staff here were so so nice but it wasn’t worth 600 Rs oily biryani. Soon, Good Earth will be opening a cafe and I have high hopes for that! I saw it and it’s SO adorable plus they are a great brand so I think it’ll be good food. It’s meant to open this season. Jodhpur Shopping Overall, Jodhpur is not known for its shopping. Basically, once you’ve seen the Fort and Palace and scheduled a tour to the Bishnoi tribal areas, then you can see where you have an afternoon to shop. You won’t find as much of those tourist shops with ali baba pants and elephant print stuff, instead it’s boutiques all in one area, most of which are overpriced. While you will see some tourist shops with that type of clothing, this isn’t the best place for having many options so you might want to wait. Shop the cape here You can go to the market by the Clock Tower to look for cheaper stuff, but I don’t think you’ll find a lot here in terms of clothes or jewelry. You might find some fabric or knick knacks as well as scarves both silk and pashmina (but probably all fake). For the boutiques I mentioned, definitely check them out as mixed into the expensive stuff are some affordable things. Basically, put “Stepwell Cafe” into your GPS or tell your driver “Sharif Chowk” or “Amar Chowk”; it’s kind of between the two on the map. Once you reach Stepwell, you’ll see the famous steps down to the well and nearby is RAAS hotel, Blue Turban hostel, and popular Namaste Cafe. This area has many boutiques you can pop in like Good Earth, Haveli Crafts, Via Jodhpur, and more. This is also near the Clock Tower so you can go there too, and to the main Sadar market and even the famous omelette shop in the market (which happens to be near Indique restaurant). One of the main things to buy in Jodhpur is the traditional wooden furniture which is ancient and collector’s items. It’s quite expensive but a million times cheaper here than some luxury furniture shop in NYC selling the same thing that they send buyers to Jodhpur to purchase and export. There are export stores/warehouses in the city. Just ask your hotel to please give you a few to go to and you can compare prices and buy items to ship home. They ship internationally all the time and it’s not a big deal so don’t let it stress you. Keep in mind a LOT of what you see in shops, even export ones, are “replicas” of antiques. You can also get in touch with Sambhali Trust, a boutique that stocks things made by local women who are taught to make items to empower them to succeed in life. It’s a great cause and I actually know a girl working with their team now, so I trust this shop. You can check them out on Instagram . Things to do in Jodhpur as a Tourist &amp; Places to Visit in Jodhpur Jodhpur isn’t as chilled as Udaipur is. In Udaipur, I wrote about how you can walk around and see signs for pop-in art classes, yoga class, ayurvedic massage, and cooking classes. Jodhpur is more like a real city not set up for tourists, so you aren’t going to see all these “things to do in Jodhpur” like you do in other Indian cities. The best thing to do is to plan out when you want to see the attractions (which I’ll mention below) then spend the rest of your time wandering around. How long should you stay in Jodhpur? The first time I went there, I stayed 3 nights (5 years ago) and wrote in my journal it was too long and two would have sufficed. This time, I stayed 3 nights again as I was traveling with a friend instead of alone and thought we could spend one day having a pool/spa day. Even with one pool/spa day, 3 nights/days was again, too much. I recommend staying just two nights! Mehrangarh Fort The fort is the #1 things to do in Jodhpur and you couldn’t miss this if you tried. It is ENORMOUS and overlooks the entire city from way up high. Almost every restaurant is a rooftop one so you can look at the fort while you eat. It’s amazing. When you tour, it’ll be 600 Rs. for a ticket and more if you take in a camera (yeah, it’s like this all over India). I didn’t bother with the headset (free) because I listened the first time I went and wrote in that blog post that it was SO boring and reading the signs was more efficient since they said the same thing. You can see the whole city from up at the fort. There are families that sit at the fort and play flutes and sing and it’s so amazing; it definitely brought on some happy tears! Jaswant Thada Aka the “white palace”. I went to this one years back, but did not visit again this year. It’s made of marble and is impressive. If you stay in Jodhpur two days, you’ll have enough time to see this as well as all the other attractions. Umaid Bhawan Palace This is where the ex-royal family live (aka the maharaja who lost power once India became a democracy). Fun fact: this palace was built during a famine and was done solely to give the local people some work so they could make money. Like mentioned above, part of this is a hotel and you cannot enter that side you can only go to the museum side. Bishnoi Village Tour Shop the top here and the bottoms here You MUST do a tour! I didn’t do this my first time into Jodhpur, but our hotel Blue House Guesthouse offered such a good rate of 600 Rs. per person that we thought what the heck, might as well check it out. I’m glad we did. While much of it is just taking you from place to place hoping that you buy stuff (and I’m sure the tour arranger would take a commission) or tip the people you meet – don’t worry, your tour guide will remind you a few times to do this ;) … it’s still worth doing. In India, you’re always dealing with middlemen and people making commissions on things, but it doesn’t make what they are selling bad. The Bishnoi village or tribe is really unique and on a few hours long tour you can go from house to house to see how they cook, their unique huts, how the make their rugs, and even try some opium with them. During it all, you’ll be driving in nature areas so will see animals. I’ve written a whole article about the experience that you can read here: What to expect on a Bishnoi tribal tour If you want a tour you can book ahead, this all day tour in Jodhpur (all hotspots) and the Bishnoi with hotel pick up and drop off is available on Viator and you can  book for $44 . It’s the best deal I’ve found. If you want to add in a camel safari, you can look at this one and  book for $60 . If you’re in a rush and just want to visit the Bishnoi, this 5-hour Bishnoi tour with pick up and drop off from your hotel is a good option;  book here for $85 . Explore the Blue City! So, the whole city of Jodhpur is not blue, it’s actually the very oldest bit up near the Fort that you’ll find the blue area. While much of the city is dirty and crowded, once you reach this area, it’s a breath of fresh air. It’s so empty and you can wander and take pictures to your heart’s desire. We saw so many tourists near the crowded Clock Tower, but when we came here to the blue part, there was no one. The truth is, it’s a MASSIVE city and this blue part isn’t that easy to stumble across if you don’t know where you are going. Ask your hotel specifically where the old city “blue city” is on the map and show that to a rickshaw driver. There is a “chowk” name for this area. It was like Noi chowk? Everyone was pronouncing it differently so I think it’s like Navi chowk but in India some say “Nawi” chowk since they change W and V here a lot. You could technically MISS THIS if you didn’t look for the blue area. Don’t make that mistake! Check out the Stepwell Maybe you’ve seen photos like this before of the huge stairwells in Jaipur, where the ladies do laundry then lay the colorful clothing out on the steps to dry? Here it’s much smaller and there are local kids jumping in for the tourists to video it (aka me, lol). It’s really a beautiful spot and for Instagram, was great for me to get some images. See a traditional show You can check Jodhpur’s official tourism page for tips on what shows you could see. I recommend seeing traditional dance. Many restaurants that overlook the fort (which is basically all rooftop restaurants) will have people pop in to do a show, and they are doing it for tips only so if you enjoy it, you can give them money after. There is a festival called RIFF on the tourism page that I just barely missed (darn!) and it’s meant to be amazing. You can also check out the Mandore Gardens which are beauitful and have temples, ruins, and monuments scattered throughout. The Ghanta Ghar (Clock Tower) is an attraction of its own as well. You can also check out nearby lakes Balsamand and Kaylana, both are man-made. For temples, the most famous is the Kunj Bihari temple followed by the Achar Nath Temple. I didn’t make time for either on this trip."https://hippie-inheels.com/dont-miss-places-visit-bomdila/,india,"The Don’t Miss Places to Visit in Bomdila Bomdila Arunachal Pradesh was one of my favorite towns in Arunachal Pradesh. This small town has a population of less than 10,000 people, is 8,800 feet above sea level, and is the home of the Monpa, Aka, Miji, Sherdukpen, and Bogun tribes. Passing into Arunachal Pradesh does require an ILP (inner line permit) or foreign permit ( read more on that here .) So, you do need to plan ahead before you visit as a foreigner, while Indian nationals can pay for the ILP then and there for 100 Rs . It’s worth the planning because there are plenty of places to visit in Bomdila as well as things to do in Bomdila! To get to Tawang, the most famous tourist attraction in this area of Arunachal, you have to pass by Bomdila anyways so take a day and night to spend some time here… and eat some Tibetan food! Momos! This is a Tibetan Mastiff. Cool dog! He’s still a puppy and will get much bigger. Where to stay in Bomdila | Bomdila Hotels There are not many options for hotels in Bomdila, as this state and most of the NE in general is only recently becoming ready for tourism. There are only TWO hotels in town &amp; there are 7 B&amp;B’s listed. I recommend staying at a B&amp;B (homestay) to get a comfortable local experience. Entrance to Sange’s mom’s house As part of the Holiday Scout tour, we got to stay with our guide Sange’s mom and sisters! It was  sooo cool! His sisters were so shy and quiet, and his mom was so kind and beautiful. They made us an amazing dinner of momos, thupka, some corn dish, dal, and more. For breakfast we had soup, thupka again I think, and “momo locos” which is bread made from the same dough as momos (it’s really good). We also had some fresh pears they grew. We actually came back and stayed another night on our way back down the mountain a few days later. We had this delicious potato/noodle soup dish served on rice (with bread… carbs, carbs, carbs) and because I LOVE carbs, I was in heaven. I declined trying the local alcohol, which is served hot, because I really don’t like the taste of liquor and would feel bad asking for something to chase down the bad taste with. Anna tried it and seemed to like it although not enough to finish it. We noticed lots of women here were drinking even near the monastery. Maybe because it’s so cold! We had a few giant blankets on our beds which was great because the Bomdila weather is pretty darn cold. I slept awesome here. We were soon to find out, it was nearly as cold as Tawang! Families seem to spend their time around the fire in the kitchen until bedtime. Some people even sleep in the kitchen near the fire. Homestays may not have western toilets or showers with a shower head above. You can heat water with the fire and use a bucket to bathe, and if you’re in India you should be used to the squatting toilets by now, right!? :) Hotels on the other hand will have this. For me, I just chose to think about my showers ahead of time and know that when I was staying somewhere very cold I would skip washing my hair and would just do a quick hot bucket bath then wrap up again by the fire. It was worth “roughing it” so to speak (not that it really was, but I think for some it may be) because the family environment is so great when you travel. It’s cozy. You can see what the houses are like (for example one room is just for prayer) and what the family vibe is like here. I loved staying with Sange’s family. Places to visit in Bomdila and things to do in Bomdila! The Bomdila pass is where you can go for great views of Kangto and Gorichen Peaks which are the highest peaks in the state. You’ll also see great views just driving further north from Bomdila to Tawang. Tour the village in the afternoon. Explore the markets and do a little shopping. make sure you negotiate! “You can bargain on MRP. It’s your right”. That’s making sure you aren’t paying more than the set rate on the item you wish to buy. It’s often written. Peppers which are particular to this area only You cannot miss the  Bomdila Monastery (GRL Monastery).  Because Sange grew up in Bomdila, he was welcomed very happily here and showed us all around. It’s always great to get that local view. This is the #1 attraction in Bomdila. Did you know Tibetan monks have  been nominated for a GRAMMY for their amazing deep chants  at another monastery? Crazy! This mandala is made in detail with sand during a religious festival. Once the festival is over, it was destroyed (all that hard work!) as a symbol of life always changing and the lack of meaning of material things.   The now Dalai Lama the 14th, who I heard speak a few years ago . There are  craft centers and emporiums to do some shopping and buy local handicraft. There are also  apple orchards to visit and  orchid farms.  We didn’t do this, as we stopped at Tipi on the way up to Bomdila and weren’t really into touring the orchids. They were mostly dead that time of year and we weren’t keen to take time learning about the flowers (sorry). Meet a fortune telling monk !  As I mentioned, we stayed at his mom’s twice. The second time was on our way back down the mountain a few days later. This was one of the coolest bits about the tour, as our guide knows this monk, also called Sange ( Sange Lama) who meditated (studied) in the jungle alone for 9 years. He came to our house (okay, Sange’s house but it was feeling a lot like home!) and had tea, sat with us in the prayer room, and read our fortunes. It was very cool. I will be writing about that experience in one of my friday “this is India” stories. Had we not been on the Holiday Scout tour , we would not have had this cool experience nor would we have gotten to see the Monpa home life."https://hippie-inheels.com/things-to-do-in-coorg/,india,"11 Kick-ass Things to do in Coorg When I heard of Coorg, all that came to mind was COFFEE, so I found myself just blown away by how much there was to do. In case you haven’t heard of this area, it’s in Karnataka, India in the Western Ghats. I went with goMowgli and one of the guides, Karan, grew up on a coffee plantation there. It was amazing to get such an inside look at the area. Here are my favorite things to do in Coorg that you can do too next time you’re in the area! At the bottom, I have links to the two VERY detailed posts I wrote on Coorg that explain these places in fuller detail. 11 Things to do in Coorg 1. Spend the day walking around Chikli Holé. It was a refreshing site to see cows eating green grass and no tourists around. The perfect place for a long walk or picnic. There is a hidden Shiva temple back here only locals know about- have fun finding it! 2. Bathing elephants. Definitely a highlight of my time in Karnataka, bathing these huge cuties at Dubare elephant camp was a blast. I loved that they were well taken care of, retired logging elephants. I also loved that they were still used for work int he jungle, rather than just for tourism. 3. Staying at cozy homestays. I mention all the ones I stayed at in my posts that I’ll link at the bottom, but getting a hotel in Coorg is silly when there are so many homestays around, most of which are on plantations of some sort. I loved coming home after a hard day trekking, having a cute lady in her nightgown pour some tea, and a friendly dog come sit by my side. Might not have had WiFi, but was well worth it! 4. Wandering ancient Madikeri. It’s this ancient town with a fort (and some amazing stories), one of the coolest museums I’ve seen in India (UM, stuffed cheetah, what!!) and had old school photographs (aka people carved into rocks) just sitting out, with no worries someone would steal them. What a town! 5. Coffee, coffee, COFFEE What can I say, Coorg is famous for coffee for a reason. We drank a lot, we saw a lot of coffee plantations, and the girls even got some to take home as souvenirs. We had it with all our food no matter what time of day! 6. Um, there’s wine too Although not the hugest fan of fruity wine, it sure was interesting to try all these random flavors like betel nut and pineapple! 7. Bylakuppe | Tibetan awesomeness Who knew the second biggest Tibetan colony is in Karnataka!? and in Coorg of all places… it was so fun to see new culture in the midst of all the curry and rice. I ate about 700 momo’s and then died of a food coma. There’s amazing temples and restaurants here, as well as local Tibetan artists, hair stylists, and markets. 8. 4 wheel driving through Mandalpatti. You just can’t ask for better views. I loved the jeep ride through the Western Ghats. This wasn’t a safari, this was pure bumpy fun! 9. Oh wait there is a better view | Thadiyandamol This trek about killed me (two hours each way, I know, I’m a wimp) but WOAH that view! Beware of leeches. 10. The secret waterfall. Ok it’s not secret because I wrote about it already, it’s called Cheladara. It was so great and no one is ever there. Perfect little stop over. 11. Iruppu Falls This one isn’t as secret, so get up early to check it out. The path to walk under is broken, but you can get it and swim a little here. It’s cold though! Coorg is clearly amazing. So there you have it! If you’re just popping through Coorg, I hope this list gives you a better idea of what all you can do. I think you could spend a full week here on your backpacking trip and absolutely love it. Better to move about and try new places than stay in one homestay."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/05/yogyakarta-travel-guide/,indonesia,"YOGYAKARTA ON A BUDGET 2018: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary Prior to this trip, Indonesia was never on my bucket list. I would always dismiss it because I had this foolish notion in my head that Indonesia is so much like the Philippines. I thought, “Why would I spend time and money on a place that is too similar to my home country?” But if there’s one lesson that I picked up during my time there, it is this: Never make conclusions about a country until you’ve actually been there.       Indonesia gently drilled its place into my heart. It’s not the kind of in-your-face lightning-fast wonder, but the gradual and lasting one. True, it bears countless similarities with the Philippines. Both are archipelagic states enjoying the similar climate. Both are known for the hospitality of its people. It was also a delight to know that we share countless words: payong (umbrella), langka (jackfruit), anak (child), kanan (right), balik (return), balai (house), balimbing (starfruit), dingding (wall), itik (duck), and kambing (goat), among others. But here’s the thing: I realized that these similarities don’t make this wonderful country less interesting; they provided me the warmth of a home away from my country. And for that, I am truly grateful.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Yogyakarta This trip is part of the Visit Asean @50 campaign of the Ministry of Tourism of Indonesia , who hosted us in Yogyakarta. The Special Region of Yogyakarta is a separate administrative entity ruled by a monarch, the Sultan, with the city of Yogyakarta as its administrative capital. The city is teeming with attractions that interlace the old with the new. It is dotted with historical and cultural landmarks, making it fit for educational trips. For those who are up for adventure and outdoor trips, there are options like ecotourism in Kaliburu, sandy activities in Parangkusumo, or the lava tour in Merapi. If you want to shop and indulge in local cuisine, Malioboro Street is the place to be! To give you an idea of what Malioboro looks like, picture Binondo of Manila or Pub Street of Cambodia. It is a major shopping street in Yogyakarta with many surrounding hotels, restaurants, and other commercial establishments. Stores along this street sell various kinds of goods such as apparel, arts and crafts, souvenir products, food, and batik. At night, it gets more exciting as many side street restaurants or lesehan line along the street, giving off a laid-back and welcoming atmosphere. Essential Information: Language : The official language is Indonesian/Bahasa Indonesia. Javanese is also widely spoken. Most people understand English, too. Currency : Indonesian Rupiah (IDR, Rp). USD 1 is around IDR 13,500; PHP 1 is around IDR 265; EUR 1 is around IDR 14,500 (as of April 2017) Modes of Payment : Regular stores and restaurants only accept Rupiah, but certain foreign currencies and major credit cards (Visa and Master Card) are accepted by most hotels, fine-dining restaurants, and souvenir shops.

The Philippines is part of the 15 countries who secured reciprocal Visa Free Agreements with Indonesia. By Air Yogyakarta is served by Adisucipto International Airport. A bigger international airport, targeted to finish in 2020, is set to rise in Kulon Progo (West of Yogyakarta) to better serve the growing tourism industry in Jogja. The airport will have a train with a direct route to Borobudur. There is no direct flight from Manila to Yogyakarta, but there are various connecting flights offered by different airline companies. Since Adisucipto connects the city to other major cities in Indonesia like Jakarta and other countries like Singapore and Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), you can choose which route will best serve you. As for my case, I took Manila (MNL) to Jakarta (CGK) via Philippine Airlines, then Jakarta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (JOG) via Garuda Indonesia Airlines. As what Philippine Airlines is to the Philippines, Garuda Indonesia prides itself as the flag carrier of Indonesia. The major airport in Jakarta serving international and domestic flights is the Jakarta International Airport also known as Soekarno Hatta Airport.

It’s the hometown of their current president, Joko Widodo. Often coined as “the twin sister of Yogyakarta”, this other major city in Central Java resembles Yogyakarta in so many ways. Solo is less touristy, so it offers that authentic Javanese culture, especially the food. Aside from the food scene, you can also visit Pasar Antik Triwindu for antique items; Ceto Temple and Sukuh Temple; Omah Sinten Heritage &amp; Resto for a royal family treatment dinner or meal; Kampoeng Batik Laweyan village or the Danar Hadi Antiques Batik Museum to learn more about Batik history and process of making it, and UNESCO World Heritage Site Museum Sangiran to know more about the ancient man and other anthropological discoveries. To get to Solo from Yogyakarta, the best and fastest option is to ride the train via Pramex train service at Yogyakarta (Tugu) Station. Travel time is 45 minutes to 1 hour, and the fare is around USD1/PHP50.   More Tips for the Poor Traveler Status of trade and commerce in Yogyakarta is healthy and stable . There are plenty of business establishments — Malioboro Street being the busiest. Aside from the abundance of educational institutions, cost of living is reasonable and cheap; hence, students flock the city. Indonesians are friendly and very helpful . Most can speak and understand English, so don’t hesitate to ask if you get lost. Weather is very unpredictable, but dry and sunny most of the time . Suggested mode of transportation is the Trans Jogja bus system . Locals highly regard this as the most reliable, most efficient, and cheapest when traveling around the city and even nearby places outside the city.

How much do we really want to know about our neighbors? About my actual neighbors, not much, to be perfectly honest. I’m not one to actually stick my nose in the dirty laundry of the Bree Van De Kamps of the world. (So sorry for the the Desperate Housewives reference. I’m ancient.)       But in the context of international tourism, hell yeah! I grew up in the Philippines, a country that is somewhat isolated from the rest of the world by a highly controversial sea to the west and a little puddle called the Pacific to the east. Our closest neighbors are situated down south. Indonesia, for example, is just a boat ride away from the southern edges of the country. Yet, with the exception of a short chapter about Javanese and Sumatran civilizations in our high school textbook and occasional Bali and Borobudur daydreaming, there really isn’t much that we I know about Indonesia. The island of Sulawesi, just across Celebes Sea, is something I only see on Asean maps. But it wasn’t until I was already there that I learned much about it. We arrived in Makassar, capital of the province of South Sulawesi, after a two-hour flight from Jakarta. Makassar is an old port city, well-known for its obsession with sailing and boat-building and well-loved for its streets that are flanked with historical buildings. The good news is, it was my first time here and there was so much to discover. The bad news is, we would be staying for only three days. But if these five places are the only things I know about our neighbor so far, I am absolutely looking forward to seeing more of Makassar. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Bantimurung National Park (Day 1) 2. Kodingareng Keke Island (Day 2) 3. Pulau Samalona (Day 2) 4. Losari Beach Sunset (Day 2) 5. Fort Rotterdam Historical Tour (Day 3) Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Bantimurung National Park (Day 1) The Bantimurung National Park isn’t really in Makassar but in Maros, 50km north of the provincial capital and 20km (roughly 30 minutes) from the airport. Its claim to fame is the 43,750-hectare Rammang Rammang Karst Area, the second largest of its kind in the world. Underneath is a network of 286 caves, two of which (called Dream Cave and Stone Cave) open right near a waterfall. If our guide is to be believed, the place got its name from “benti,” meaning water and “murung” meaning rumble, referring to the thundering sound that the waterfall makes. Inside one of the caves 2. Kodingareng Keke Island (Day 2) An hour boat ride away from Kayu Bangkoa Port in Makassar lies Kodingareng Keke, one of South Sulawesi’s many uninhabited islands. It’s small, just a wisp away from becoming a naked sandbar, what most tropical beach fantasies are made of. The cay is surrounded by a vibrant coral reef soaked in an even brighter turquoise waters. Snorkeling is a must, but be cautious of sea urchins. Although uninhabited, there’s a roofed structure at the end of the wooden jetty where you can go to for shade. How to get there: At Kayu Bangkoa Port, rent a motor boat to the cay. (Travel time: 40-60 minutes. Fare: 500,000 IDR.) The boat can accommodate up to 10 passengers, which means the cheap way to go is to form a group with others with whom you can split the cost. 3. Pulau Samalona (Day 2) Just 20 minutes away, a visit to Pulau Samalona is usually packaged with any trip to Kodingareng Keke. It is bigger, much closer to the city, and harbors a small village, making it the usual lunch (and toilet) stop. The island is famous for its World War II shipwrecks so snorkeling and diving are highly recommended. How to get there: At Kayu Bangkoa Port, rent a motor boat to the cay (20 minutes). You can stop here before or after your time at Kodingareng Keke. 4. Losari Beach Sunset (Day 2) There are many reasons to set foot on Losari Beach, Makassar’s most well-known strip. It’s a jump off point to Kodingareng Keke and Samalona Island. It has a kilometer-long lane of food stalls and souvenir stores. But the one that I was drawn by the most is that it offers a stunning view of the sunset. There’s no other way of capping off a day of swimming and snorkeling than just sit there and watch the skies do what it does best: mesmerize. 5. Fort Rotterdam Historical Tour (Day 3) On our last day in Makassar, we could not leave without a look at Dutch colonial architecture at Fort Rotterdam, one of the best-preserved in Indonesia. Taking the shape of a turtle when viewed from above, it rises at the site where an old Gowanese fort once stood (which was said to be built in 1545). The Gowanese believed that the turtle is the ultimate symbol of adaptation, being able to live both in water and on land. It was taken over by the Dutch in 1667. Today, the fort houses the Museum Negeri La Galigo, featuring various exhibits. You can also see parts of the original wall as you walk around. Opening hours : Daily 8am-6pm. Entrance Fee : FREE if you’ll just roam the courtyards. The La Galigo Museum, however, collects a 10,000 IDR admission fee."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/09/gili-trawangan-air-meno-indonesia-budget-travel-guide-itinerary-expenses/,indonesia,"GILI ISLANDS ON A BUDGET: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary There are three things that I always make sure I experience when I’m on an island getaway, and they all start with S: the sea, the sunset, and loud, scandalous sss.., uhm, singing. Yep. sea, sunsets, and singing. For real. When it comes to the sea and sunsets, the famed Gili Islands off the coast of Lombok, Indonesia, will not disappoint. This trio is composed of Gili Trawangan, the largest, most populated and the most developed of the three; Gili Meno, middle and the smallest; and Gili Air, the second biggest and closest to mainland Lombok. The band is located off the northwestern coast of Lombok and dots the southern edges of Bali Sea.       It is the most popular destination in Lombok, initially riding on the tourism pull of Bali and often a favorite side trip for Bali vacationers who are seeking more island and diving adventures. Its first waves of tourists were made up of divers and snorkelers. Over the years, the islands have seen rapid development — mostly concentrated in the largest of the three, Gili Trawangan — with cafes, bars, and other establishments mushrooming along the beach. Slowly, it has earned a reputation of being a “party destination.” Yet, it still is far more relaxed and laidback than Bali, something that I really enjoyed about the place. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Best Time to Visit Gili Islands How to Get to Gili Islands Where to Stay in the Gili Islands Things to Do in Gili Islands Sample Itinerary Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Best Time to Visit Gili Islands Gili Air Beach The months of July, August, September are considered peak season because of the good weather. Rain and storms are highly unlikely during these months. December and January are also considered high season because of the Christmas and New Year demand. As with any other tourist destination, rates are higher throughout these months and accommodations get sold out easily. Make sure you book your hotel before coming to the island. The rainy months of February to April are considered low season. One thing you also need to consider when planning your trip is the Balinese holiday called Nyepi, which is usually observed on a day in mid-March. On this day, the entire island of Bali goes on a standstill. No lights, no businesses, no outside activities are allowed. This is important because you might be going to the Gilis via Bali. Seaports and the airport will be closed on this day. However, this is not observed in Gili Islands or Lombok. How to Get to Gili Islands Two airports serve as gateways to Gili Islands: Lombok International Airport (LOP) in Praya and Ngurah Rai International Airport also known as Denpasar Airport (DPS) in Bali. Note that Lombok is much closer to the Gilis, making it the fastest route but not necessarily the most cost effective. Gili Air Snorkeling If you’re coming from outside of Indonesia, fare to Lombok costs a little bit more because you’re most likely connecting in another Indonesian city like Jakarta, Surabaya, or Denpasar (Bali). You can also connect outside the country. There are direct flights from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, but they cost much more, sometimes double or triple, unless you get your ticket during a promo. If you’re flying directly to Lombok At the airport, hire a metered taxi or private car to Bangsal Harbor (Bangsal Port). A metered taxi ride costs approximately IDR 300,000, while private car service may cost somewhere between IDR 400,000 to 650,000 depending on the company. Note that taxis in Lombok must always use the meter. Travel time is around 2.5 hours. At Bangsal Port, walk to the beach where you will find the ticket office for public boats. DO NOT buy tickets where the taxi would drop you off. Scams are rampant in this area, and touts will do everything they can to squeeze money out of you. You will be told that there are no more public boats or that the ticket office is closed, but ignore them. Just walk straight to Bangsal Harbor and look for the ticket booth there. Take the public boat to the Gili Island you wish to visit. A public boat ticket costs IDR 8,000 for Gili Air, IDR 9,000 for Gili Meno, and IDR 10,000 for Gili Trawangan. The boat will not leave until the boat if full. Make sure you’re in Bangsal between 8am to 4pm so you have more people to share the boat with. Alternatively, if you are a group and you have more money than time, you may charter a private boat in Bangsal or in nearby Senggigi for around IDR 200,000 depending on your negotiating skills. Again, whatever you choose, DO NOT INTERACT with the touts. If you’re coming from Bali If Bali is part of your itinerary, you have four options in reaching the Gili Islands. (There are a few more choices, to be honest, but they cost a fortune, so let’s skip them for now.) By Plane to Lombok . There are direct flights from Denpasar (Bali) to Lombok and vice versa. Fly from Denpasar Airport to Lombok.Fare: around IDR 400,000 (USD 50)Travel time: 50 minutes From Lombok Airport, follow the steps listed above. Via Padang Bai Padang Bai is a port town located 60-90 minutes from the Denpasar Airport or Kuta Beach. The thing with this route is, there are ferries to the Gili Islands only in the morning. Gili Cat, one of the more popular operators in the island, departs Padang Bai at 9:15am. (Embarkation starts at 8:45am.) There are seasonal afternoon sails, but it’s safer to just leave in the morning. If you wish to go to Gili Islands on the same day of your arrival, make sure that the flight you’re booking lands before 6am. This ensures you have time to go through Immigration, find land transfers, travel to the port, and buy ticket. Note that this does not yet take flight delays in consideration, so you might still need to book a much earlier flight to be on the safe side. What many travelers do is spend a night in Kuta or in Padang Bai instead. To Gili Trawangan Departure time: 9:15amTravel time: 80 minutes.Fare: IDR 1.2 Million (USD 92), roundtrip; IDR 700,000 (USD 54), one-way To Gili Air Departure time: 8:45amTravel time: 120 minutesFare: IDR 1.02 Million (USD 78), roundtrip; IDR 630,000 (USD 48 ) If you have a lot of time, you may also take the slow, public ferry to Lombok (4-5 hours) and then ride a boat to Gili Trawangan when you reach Bangsal Harbor. Via Amed Amed is a beach accessible after an almost 3-hour drive from the airport of Kuta Beach. It has its own port, which is closest to the Gili Islands than any other port in Bali. Although distant, one thing that’s going for Amed is that it is a beautiful place especially at sunrise. It’s far from all the chaos, noise, and overdevelopment in other parts of the island. Departure time: 9:30amTravel time: 1 hourFare: IDR 875,000 (USD 67) roundtrip Where to Stay in the Gili Islands You can find hotels and resorts in all three islands, although a big fraction of them are in Gili Trawangan. You can find a wide range of accommodations, from luxury resorts to homestays that offer rooms for as low as IDR 150,000 (USD 12) for a fan room. If homestays are not your thing, check out some of their budget and mid-range hotels. Things to Do in Gili Islands All three islands are small and can explored end-to-end on foot. Know that there are no cars, motorbikes or any other motorized vehicles in the islands. To get around, you either walk, bike, or ride horse-drawn carts called cidomo. Cidomo fare can be somewhere between IDR 20,000 to 50,000, depending on your destination. Gili Trawangan Island Bike Adventure Here are some activities to enjoy: Island Hopping . You don’t need to charter a private boat to explore all three islands. You just need to catch the public boats. There’s always one boat in the morning, usually between 8am to 9:30am, and another in the afternoon, usually between 3-4pm. Fare: IDR 18,800 (USD1.5) to IDR 25,000 (USD 2) depending on your route. Bike Tour . Most hotels and homestays also offer bike rental services, the cost of which usually ranges from IDR 50,000 for 4 hours to IDR 150,000 for 24 hours. A circumferential road runs along the beach which is perfect for biking. Some parts are sandy so be prepared to drag your bike at times. Do it just after dawn or before sunset. Have a sunset photo of you taken while on an Ocean Swing . Standing in shallow waters on the west side of the Gili Trawangan, include this as one of your stops in your biking tour. The use of the ocean swings are FREE, but be prepared for the long queue. Snorkel or dive! The Gilis’ marine life made these islands famous, so you absolutely need to take a peek at what’s hiding in its emerald waters. Make sure you have a waterproof or underwater cam. Food trip! There are a lot of well-known restaurants in the island. Seafood, of course, is their specialty and they fuse it with other cuisines. For example, Scallywags Organic Seafood Bar &amp; Grill Restaurant serves marinara pasta alongside a wide selection of grilled seafood! Their menu is filled with dishes that play within the price range of IDR 40,000 for starters to IDR 150,000 for main courses. Or if you just want to cool down and beat the heat, have a glass of fruit shake (or cocktails!). Party! They’re not calling it a party island for nothing. But be cautious of accepting drinks from strangers. Also, keep it clean. Indonesia has some of the harshest laws for drug-related offenses. Drug possession can put you in jail for up to 12 years. Drug trafficking can send you to the death row. Sample Itinerary Here’s a sample 3D2N itinerary. This assumes that you’ll be coming from Bali and staying in Gili Trawangan. If you’re going to use this as guide, make sure you book a flight that will arrive in the early morning or spend the night in Padang Bai or Kuta. Also, it would be best to book your tickets in advance.

I’ve been to 7 more countries since then, and Bandung still stands out as one of the most interesting places I visited! There are so many things to do in Bandung, Indonesia that I recommend you spend at least 5 days there as you’ll have to drive both North and South of the city. 5 Things to do in Bandung (you can’t miss!) 1. Kawah Ratu This is the biggest attraction in the North: a volcanic crater! Tangkuban Parahu is the mountain (or area) and it is an active volcano. You can hike around here as well. At Kawah Ratu you’ll be able to see one of the most breathtaking sights I’ve seen on my travels. You can also ride a pony! Tip: make sure to buy and eat some berries here. They grow all around these region. You can even visit their farms. Read more about North Bandung here. 2. Kawah Putih The “white crater” is my favorite of the things to do in Bandung on this list. It’s another volcanic crater than is now a sulfur lake. This one is in Souther Bandung. The color of the water changes between white and green as the sulfur concentrations changes. Many people were wearing masks here, but the smell wasn’t that bad. What an amazing place! 3. Walini Ranca These are the famous tea fields of the area. You will drive past many but this specific spot is perfect to get out and wander around. The rock in the middle makes for a perfect place to take a photo. The strawberry fields were just down the street. I think this was my second favorite place. I have to say though, I had never seen a tea field like this so was really excited. If you’ve explored them before you might find it less exciting. Read more about South Bandung here. 4. The Food! Because you’re not in the city you get to eat very traditional style . Sindang Reret in the South served up traditional Sundanese food in the little huts pictured. Sari Ater, North of the city, which is one of the hotels where you can enjoy hot springs, also had amazing food. To try more street style and snack food you can also hit up the floating market in the North for a huge variety. 5. The fantastic Trans Luxury complex The Trans Luxury hotel is the only 6 star hotel in Indonesia and is in the perfect location in the city."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-jarkata/,indonesia,"Luxury Guide to Jakarta Welcome to Backpacker’s Boutique. Every Sunday, this spot will feature a new travel blogger. Some weeks it will be a really fun  interview about packing, fashion, and fitness  so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it’ll be a  detailed   luxury guide  to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.  E-mail me if you’d like to be featured. A Luxury Guide to Jakarta Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Jakarta. Hi!   I’m Justine, a backpacker turned expat.   I actually just moved to Phnom Penh where I work as a freelance writer.   But before I moved to Cambodia I had the opportunity to live in Jakarta, Indonesia, for a full year.   A lot of people don’t really know this but Jakarta is a great city for indulging in all things luxury.   From 5-star hotels to fancy spas to trendy shops, Jakarta seriously has it all.   The sky really is the limit there! What makes Jakarta a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? When most people think of Jakarta the word “glamorous” isn’t the first word to pop into their minds…at least it wasn’t for me.   But when I moved there I realized that I had been seriously mistaken.   Hidden beneath the chaotic surface is all the glitz and glamour you could ever want.   It’s possible to dine at French bistros, book a night in a $15,000 a night presidential suite (no joke!), or drink the night away at an amazing rooftop bar.   Seriously, if you’ve got the money Jakarta is the place to spend it! What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? When I first moved to Jakarta my boyfriend and I were put up in the Pullman Jakarta Central Park , a super swank 5-star hotel located in the heart of the city.   Our room had floor-to-ceiling windows, and the views of the city were pretty incredible.   What I liked about the Pullman was that it was really modern and full of funky art, and it pretty much had the best international buffet restaurant ever , offering everything from sushi to traditional Indonesian foods to ultra-fancy desserts.   But this city is loaded with really nice hotels, the Hotel Mulia Senayan and Hotel Indonesia Kempinski are where a lot of VIPs and celebrities stay (rooms go for around $250+ a night).  What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The ARTOTEL is mid-range boutique hotel that I’m obsessed with.   I never got the chance to stay there but I did frequent its great rooftop bar, BART .   (FYI, they make a killer old fashioned!)   What I love about the ARTOTEL is that it’s one of the few quality boutique hotels in the Jakarta.   Every room is unique and the walls are decorated by some of the city’s most renowned street artists.   It’s really nice, really affordable and it offers something truly unique – a quality I always appreciate in hotels. (Rooms start at around $65) Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? The first thing that pops into my mind is either taking a day trip to the botanical gardens of nearby Bogor or visiting neighboring Bandung to check out the otherworldly crater lake, Kawah Putih .   But for anyone who’s looking for a bit of adventure within the city center, I wrote a whole guide all about the fun and weird things to do in Jakarta .   There are tons of options for anyone who’s looking for a little adventure!  Where are the best hang outs during the day? Jakarta is a city of malls.   And most of them are really, really high end.   Two of the most famous malls are Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia .   They are filled with every designer store imaginable.   And they are so big they can keep you entertained for an entire day.   Jakarta is pretty much a shopper’s paradise.   Or, if you’re just looking for a place to hang out, the malls are home to some of the city’s best restaurants.   Another great place to hang out is Pantai Indah Kapuk (PIK) , a beachside area that has tons of great cafes and restaurants.  If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Jakarta and what are their best dishes? This is tough because Jakarta is full of really, really great restaurants, so I’ll just name a couple!   Namaaz is a molecular gastronomy restaurant and it’s all the rage in Jakarta right now.   It’s so exclusive it can only accommodate 28 people per night.   They serve a 17-course meal, which is constantly changing depending on the season.   It’s progressive Indonesian food, so they serve up dishes like sate klopo (satay with charcoal-smoke infused cassava), wedang jahe (a sweet ginger soup) and nitrogen ice cream.   Potato Head Garage is another Jakarta favorite.   It’s sort of like a modern twist on a steakhouse.   Their menu has things like Asian Beef Tartare, spiced with galangal and kaffir lime, and is famous for all things beef.  Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Indonesians love desserts so there is no shortage of great dessert spots in the city.   Probably the best place to get crème brulee is at Labruletory (located in a funky “anti-mall” called Pasar Santa ).   It almost looks more like a science project than a dessert but it is fantastic – they even have a green tea version!   My favorite place for cupcakes is Twelve Cupcakes .   It’s actually a Singaporean company but there are shops sprinkled around Jakarta.   The red velvet and peanut butter chocolate are to die for!   The Nutella martabak (like a thick pancake) from Martabak Boss is probably my favorite dessert in the city! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Anyone who knowns me knows that I’m not the most fashion-savvy person.   But because I worked as a lifestyle writer for The Jakarta Post , it allowed me to meet some up-and-coming Jakarta-based designers.   One of my favorite young designers is named Martha Ellen .   As a traveler I’m always fond of designers who incorporate traditional elements into their work.   She is a British-native based out of Jakarta and uses a traditional Indonesian fabric called ikat to create colorful and cute dresses, skirts, tops…you name it.   The Goods Dept is also the place to find all of Indonesia’s trendy local designers. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Jakarta? Jakarta has so many salons, it honestly isn’t even possible to walk a block without running into one.   But when it comes to massages, Kneads to Know is a great new place.   SPA Intercontinental is an excellent place to splurge on a rubdown.   They are famous for their red wine wrap! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? That’s easy.   Anyone who’s visiting Jakarta needs to visit Skye Bar at least once.   It’s a great place to grab a drink and because it’s on the 59th floor it easily has the best view in the city. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. BART (located in the ARTOTEL) was my go-to spot to get a drink, mainly because it had a good vibe, great music and I just have a thing for rooftop bars!   The Safehouse is also a fun place to go for a cocktail.  If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Jakarta is famous for its nightclubs.   There are honestly tons to choose from.   Immigrants is great because it has a killer view of the city, and I hear great things about Dragonfly and Colosseum too."https://hippie-inheels.com/what-to-do-in-northern-bandung/,indonesia,"Northern Bandung | mountains and volcanic craters I didn’t know what to expect at all when I got to Bandung , least of all what to do in Northern Bandung. I was there on a trip with Indonesia and Bandung tourism, and didn’t have much time to research the area. I was BLOWN AWAY with the sights. Some of the best parts were just seeing the big clouds over the mountains. How was the sky so blue and the tea leaves so green?! It was like it had been photoshopped.. in fact, my photos almost look photoshopped! But as you can imagine, I’m not that techy. I also loved the donkeys and horses, the rice fields all over the countryside, the random guys helping with traffic (were they hired or just helping, because their clothes were just normal!), the sunsets, the fog, the cold mornings, and the clean feeling in the air. I wish I could have taken photos of the drive to Tangkuban Parahu, but the windy roads were making me feel a little sick… plus the fact breakfast was rice and noodles, no kidding! On your way up north, you should maybe take motion sickness pills. I’ll share a little bit about Tangkuban Parahu, the floating market, and learning to play the angklung. Sari Ater This hotel has huge hot springs that they boast as some of the best in the world. Your showers will actually have the hot spring water coming out. It’s a great resort and the swimming pools have been built into the spring! They have off-road go-karts, horses, and awesome 4 wheel drive adventures. Tangkuban Parahu Bandung was actually a lake a long time ago, but is now a huge city with something like 2 million people living there. Although some parts are prone to flooding, the lake is long gone. Now, the volcanoes and mountains that surround make for a great view from the city. If you drive north to Tangkuban Parahu which is an active  volcano, you’ll get to see a HUGE volcanic crater called Kawah Ratu (Queen Crater). It’s amazing. There are vendors dotted around and people giving donkey (or mule? or small horse?) rides. You’ll also see everyone selling the locally grown blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries. It’s kind of perfect. No one hassles you to shop either. Bandung Floating Market The floating market is a great place to try local food. You can have a real lunch first, then snack if you like. You’ll switch money from tokens to make it easy. I don’t suggest taking the boat out and seeing the different floating stalls, but rather it’s easier to taste from land on the other side. Plus, rowing the boats is a work out and makes photography hard. Definitely taste the “crepes”, dim sum, banana cake (so cute!), and all the varieties of delicious fried food. I even got a lollipop I saved for the parade. Saung Angklung Udjo In West Java, the Sundanese still play their traditional instrument, the angklung. It’s made of bamboo and different sizes are different octaves. I wish I could have gotten more photos from the center, Saung Angklung Udjo, where we saw a performance and also a traditional play. You will want to tap along to the play’s music, but trust me, it’s impossible to follow the beat! Have you ever heard the quote from actress Kristen Bell,  “if I’m not on a 3-7 on an emotional scale, I’m crying”.  That is so me! I tear up sometimes with sad commercials, and I have teared up more times than I can count in India when something sweet happens. I was sitting in the stands feeling so lucky to see their art form and to be on the trip in general, and the kids started playing Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody. I started to tear up! I cheered so loud when it was over and the kids took us out to dance with them. We got to play our own angklungs which was pretty damn cool!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-bali/,indonesia,"A Luxury Guide to Bali Welcome to Backpacker’s Boutique.

A Luxury Guide to Bali Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Bali. Hi! I’m Claire, author of BackpackingBella.com , where I share my stories and tips for enjoying beautiful travel on a budget. But I didn’t always do this. For over a decade I worked in the media and was lucky enough to visit top restaurants and 5 star hotels. When I left to go backpacking around the world, I naturally expected things to be much less glamorous. Then I discovered Bali, where you can enjoy a stay in beautiful surroundings and feel like a VIP, on a tiny budget. Perfect! What makes Bali a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Bali has everything. From blissful beaches to lush green rice fields as far as the eye can see; top class spas and cocktail bars; laid back seaside villages, ornate temples and peaceful mountain hideaways. It’s all about relaxing and soaking up the beauty of the place – the island’s nature and the people’s culture. This alone feels like such a privileged experience and it’s totally free. What 5 star hotel is the best in Bali? If you’re after something swanky, most of Bali’s 5 star hotels in Bali are located on Seminyak’s high end beach front or among the lush greenery of Sayan, near Ubud. While my travelling budget doesn’t stretch to 5 star, I’ve always liked the cool and contemporary W hotels. The W Retreat &amp; Spa in Seminyak does the best Sunday brunch around and its chic bars host some of the area’s most happening nights thanks to its international resident DJs. What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? So many to choose from… Bali is spoiled for choice with boutique hotels and guest houses, where you can unwind and feel inspired. You don’t have to spend a fortune to find fabulous places. In Seminyak, try the Bali V hotel with its chic white rooms and swimming pool. For a getaway, the Aditya Guest House in the mountain village of Munduk has stunning views and four poster beds. There’s even a boutique hostel for backpackers: the Jolie Hostel in Jimbaran , which has a pool and a great atmosphere. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? Plenty. On this island you can be as laid back or as active as you choose. Bali boasts some of Asia’s best scuba diving and snorkelling spots. Or catch a boat to the islands of Nusa Lembongan , the Gilis and Lombok , which are worth exploring and also offer great diving. Yoga is huge, especially in Ubud , with centres including the fabulous Yoga Barn . For the truly adventurous, I recommend the Munduk Wilderness Adventure for a fantastically fun day of buggy driving and bike riding through the hills. Where are the best hang outs during the day? There are some great cafés in Bali. Kafé and Atmans in Ubud are two of my favourites for laptops and lattes, while the Deki  warung  in Balian is a great place to watch surfers and kite surfers tackling the waves – the beach itself is also divine for a daytime walk. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Bali and what are their best dishes? I’d head straight to the glamorous Merah Putih in Seminyak . The innovative fusion food here tastes heavenly, especially the Sumatran roasted duck curry and the Balinese suckling pig. Just this week, the restaurant and its chef were nominated for four awards. Let’s talk desserts – what place makes the best? I’m not really a dessert person, but Bali has the best ever chocolate and banana pancakes I’ve ever tasted. Yum! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Seminyak has all the high end labels you could need, alongside local, Australian and European designers. In Ubud you’ll find a host of smaller boutiques, independent art galleries and stores selling handcrafted wooden furniture and stunning home furnishings. You will want to have the whole lot shipped back home. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Bali? There is a proud tradition of Balinese massage and many first class spas here. Indulge at the SPA at The Samaya in Seminyak or visit Ubud’s small but beautifully formed Wellness in Ubud. If you want to learn it for yourself, take a course at the Bali BISA Spa School in Sanur . Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Munduk has wonderful multi-coloured sunsets, while the chilled out beach villages of Amed also enjoy beautiful skies, against a mountain backdrop. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Potato Head is a legendary beach club in Seminyak where you can sip artfully created cocktails while checking out the beautiful people. Their Bloody Mary is accompanied by sushi condiments and tastes bloody amazing. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Instead of going clubbing, I would make a date for an all-night beach party on the nearby island of Gili Trawangan, where you can dance on the sand to awesome DJ tunes, while fire dancers perform in front of you, until the morning sun comes up."https://hippie-inheels.com/backpacking-iran-one-month-itinerary/,iran,"One Month Backpacking Iran | Top 10 Experiences Was backpacking Iran crazy? On our one way ticket to the Far East we never planned on stopping in Iran, a country we knew little about. However, we had heard some amazing stories from backpackers who had visited Iran. So we decided to go for it! And boy are we happy that we did. We spent one month travelling the country, from the date palm trees in the south, through the deserts in the west to the freezing mountains in the north. Iran seems to offer everything a nature-lover can desire, where you can enjoy four seasons all-year round. Here you’ll find the hottest deserts on earth, the world’s largest water cave and the tallest mountains in the Middle-East. Not to mention, being repeatedly titled the most hospitable nation in the world by experienced travellers, with an unrivaled cultural heritage of ancient Persia. Backpacking Iran But is it really safe to visit Iran? At first our ignorant minds wandered about the Islamic State in Iraq and Afghani Taliban. How can it possibly be safe to travel to Iran, bordered between these two unstable countries? But we were wrong! After filtering through media propaganda and US embassy warnings, we found heaps of real travel stories, all mentioning how safe it is to visit Iran. After spending 30 days in the country we can now share our own personal experience. We felt safe from day one! Even when wandering the streets after nightfall. Iranians have the utmost respect for travellers and make their efforts in convincing you that Iran is safe, disproving the media rumors. As a result of a strict Islamic regime, violent crime rates are low, even lower than in the US. That being said, every country has its own set of rules and Iran might have stricter rules than most countries, but as a travelers it is your responsibility to respect them. These rules might bother some, for instance gender separation and strict female dress codes. Women must cover their hair by law and dress appropriately. However after a few days in Iran this gets into habit and by respecting their culture you will not face any trouble. Also, keep in mind that many Iranians disagree with the opinions of the ruling government. So don’t let your own thoughts of the islamic regime keep you away from visiting this beautiful nation. So now that your safety concerns are out of the question, let’s have a closer look at what the country really has to offer. 10 things to experience while backpacking Iran 1. Enjoy Iranian cuisine, sitting on a Persian carpet You won’t find many restaurants in the country, since Iranians prefer to cook at home. Most dishes include rice and meat (lamb, chicken or fish) mixed with various herbs and spices. Kebab with saffron rice is a popular dish, but the Fesenjan, a savory stew featuring duck, pomegranate and walnut, is a must try! Sitting on the carpet floor is the usual way of dining for most Iranians, whether poor or rich. At first we had some difficulties finding a comfortable position, but with every meal our muscles and ligaments seemed to get more and more used to the strain. Somehow sitting together on a beautiful Persian carpet makes the atmosphere more relaxed and less formal than dining at a dinner table. 2. Go back to ancient Persia and visit Persepolis Did you know that Iran is home to one of the world’s oldest civilizations and hosts thirteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites? Persepolis is one of them and one of the greatest ancient UNESCO sites in the Middle East. Built over 2500 years ago, Persepolis was the capital of the Persian Empire, back when it reached from Greece to India. The world empire was thought to have inhabited 44% of the world’s population during these times (the highest such number of any world empire). Its glory came to an end when Alexander the Great burned and sacked the city 333 BC, leaving Persepolis in ruins ever since. 3. Climb the Kalouts of the Shahdad desert The so-called Kalouts are a rare formation of towering sand rocks, scattered around in the Shahdad desert. Here you will also find one of the hottest spots on earth, with ground temperatures reaching as high as 70°C during summer. Here you won’t find any living creatures, except maybe the toughest bacteria. 4. Meet the locals and learn how to Tarof Iranians are famous for being one of the most hospitable nations in the world. You won’t have to wait long to test this reputation. We hadn’t even landed in Iran, but already we were starting to get invitation to stay for dinner or overnight from complete strangers. Accept these offers once in a while and get to know the unique etiquette of Tarof, where denying a cup of tea at least three times before accepting is considered courteous. 5. Go skiing in Dizin In the Alborz mountain range, north of Tehran, you’ll find one of the highest ski resorts in the world, Dizin. This resort has a good number of pistes to choose from and at the top (4000 m) you’ll get a perfect view over Mt. Damavand, Iran’s tallest mountain. 6. Try the local wine in Shiraz Shiraz is a beautiful city with many places worth visiting, from holy mosques and shrines to busy bazaars and botanical gardens. Many might be familiar with the city’s name from its reputation of producing the finest wine in the Middle East. Apparently, making wine for export is legal but consuming alcohol in Iran is illegal! Despite that, many Iranians in Shiraz will invite you their own homemade wine, but behind closed doors. 7. Visit half of the world in Esfahan Once a capital of Iran and known for being one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with tree-lined boulevards, historical bridges and Islamic architecture. There is a famous rhyme in Persian “Esfahan nesf-e Jahan”, meaning “Esfahan is half of the world”. 8. Get lost in Abyaneh, the ancient mountain village. Often referred to as the Red Village for its red mud brick houses and the surrounding mountain terrain (bearing the same colour due to iron oxides). The village is at least 1500 years old originating from the time of the Arab invasion, when many of the Persians fled to the mountains and deserts to escape forced conversion to Islam. 9. Sail into the largest water cave in the world Take a 2.4 km boat tour inside Ali-Sadr cave, the largest of its kind. On the walls inside you’ll find pictures of animals and hunting scenes dating back to 12.000 years ago. 10) Bargain for a Persian carpet at the bazaar It can take one person up to 6-12 months to weave a 1.5 x 1.0 m carpet depending on how dense you weave it (knots per square inch). They can cost you up to 5000$, but you can get them for cheaper, with fewer knots made from cheap wool instead of silk, colored with chemicals instead of organic dyes, but we couldn’t get our eyes off the irresistible and shiny silk carpets woven to perfection. Take your time, drink tea with the owners and visit a few different shops. When you find the right carpet, remember to bargain heavily! So, those are your top 10 things to do in Iran! If you are looking for a country off the beaten path, then Iran is the place for you. The tourism is quite underdeveloped and it’s remarkable to see how Iranians stay close to their old traditions. Due to sanctions and poor economy, the lack of foreign influence seem to have locked in the true Persian culture and way of life. This makes Iran a rewarding place to visit especially for curious travelers who want to learn the basis of the country, who its people are and what their culture stands for – ignoring political propaganda and news headlines. So hurry up while you can, you never know when the sanctions will be lifted off, blowing in a gust of Western influence."https://hippie-inheels.com/3-days-in-dublin-howth-cliffs/,ireland,"3 Days in Dublin Including a Day Trip to Howth Cliffs Dublin is somewhere I’ve always wanted to go back to, and it’s a place my friend, Arielle, always wanted to visit so we decided to fly here after our week in England . I’d actually spend four days in Dublin seven years ago, and wrote this post about it , so I re-read it to remind myself what to do here, like visiting Howth cliffs! We had a few things on our agenda: find an Airbnb in a good location, sightsee and visit the Guinness Storehouse, try afternoon tea, have a nice dinner, and go on a day trip to the coast. Transportation and Lodging in Dublin We really had just 2.5 days, but it was plenty of time to do everything we wanted. Our goal was to spend day one sightseeing, day two at the coast and come back to Dublin for a nice dinner, then the half day we had on day three visiting the Guinness factory before our evening flight. We stayed at this Airbnb  which was my first time doing a shared house (a room in someone else’s house) since my Couchsurfing days. I think it was around $70/night which is a steal for Dublin. We were on the river near the Guinness Storehouse. Key things about this spot are that the Airlink (shuttle from the airport) stops right outside their apartment and the sightseeing bus also does! The Airlink 747 bus is a big green bus outside Dublin airport that goes all over town. It was 12 Euro for a return ticket. It is slow but way cheaper than a taxi, especially in traffic so I wouldn’t take it again this far. The Sightseeing bus is the same one I used years ago! I wrote back then about how it saves money on transportation because you can use it from your hotel/Airbnb to town and back so the hop on hop off part within the town is kind of like a bonus. These are the big red open top buses. It’s 19 Euro for an adult ticket. If you plan to see the Guinness Storehouse and sightsee near Temple Bar all in one day, this bus will be a great deal for you. Sightseeing in Dublin Dublin has some key sites like the Guinness Storehouse, Dublin Castle, St Stephen’s Green, Temple Bar, and Trinity College to name a few. Dublin is nothing like London where you need all day walking a million miles to see everything; you can just wander slowly and see a lot of the key attractions. One of the best things about revisiting a city is that there’s less pressure to “see it all” and Arielle isn’t that into crazy sightseeing so we just kept it casual and checked out the places I mentioned above, skipping out on some smaller places. We ate at the Brazenhead which was near our Airbnb, and it was really tasty. They say it’s the oldest pub in Dublin! The Guinness Storehouse was 11 Euro when I went years back and is 25 Euro now. Honestly, I think it’s way too much money to tour how they make Guinness and the Gravity bar up top is too crowded to even enjoy it. I don’t like Guinness, but I guess if you do then you might think it’s worth the cash. I’d also been here before, so maybe it just wasn’t as “wow” the second time around. Rocking my airport clothes, haha, we headed there after this Cheers to my bestie since I was 5! Afternoon Tea at the Westin One of Arielle’s things she wanted to do was afternoon tea. In Ireland, that involves gin apparently! I had no idea the Irish liked gin so much. We went for afternoon tea at the Westin and didn’t have tea at all, but a gin cocktail served in a teapot. Yumz! We tried everything on the platter from the pork to crab cones, but we aren’t fancy people (haha, far from it!) so the salmon and caviar weren’t really our thing. It was so funny because the waitress came over and was like “do you not eat fish?” and we said oh not really raw stuff, and she’s like well what did you like most and I’ll bring it out – we’re like the turkey wrap! haha, the most basic thing of them all, but it was so tasty! The banana bread and desserts were so good. I highly recommend having an afternoon tea in Dublin! Sightseeing can be tiring and around the Temple Bar it seems like the other thing to “do” is stop in for a beer in a crowded bar. So, doing the tea was a really nice kind of different thing to do.  The Westin’s was great. Dinner at  Conrad Coburg Brasserie Arielle and I went for a fancy dinner for our last meal in Ireland at the Coburg Brasserie inside the Conrad Hotel. The hotel invited us, and it was a complimentary meal in case I wanted to feature it on the blog. I never write about stuff I don’t like, and this was really yummy and a nice treat for us. We both had tomato soup to start then I got a burger and Arielle had the steak. The food was delicious, but the drinks were the best part. They have a menu based on travel (hence inviting me to come try!) and it’s a menu that tells the story of Gulliver’s Travels through the drinks. Did you know the author, Jonathon Swift, was an Irish writer!? The drinks are a work of art! My first one had the ingredients listed then it said: “and a touch of magic”. It came out with a lid that when I lifted it, smoke came out and it was a smokey flavored drink. Another said “and a fact” and there was a little scroll on it with a fact about the author. The dessert platter was delicious. Their take on banoffee pie was so tasty and Arielle’s favorite dessert of the trip! Mine too! Day Trip to the Coast: Howth If you go to Dublin, you must take half a day at least to go to Howth! The photos will talk you into it more than I ever could so, check these out. Getting to Howth Cliffs: Just take a taxi to Connelly train station in Dublin and there are trains every 10 minutes or so to Howth. Tickets were about 6 Euro round trip. The last train leaves Howth back to Dublin at 11 pm, so don’t miss it. It’s just a 25-minute journey! What to do in Howth: The Dog House is next to the train station and is pretty popular so we popped in here for a coffee to take to the harbor. The market (food and souvenirs) is across the street from the train station but didn’t open until a little later in the day. The Dog House When you get to Howth, you’ll be right near the Harbor, so you can go check that out first and see the seals and fishing boats. Some of the most famous restaurants are right here. After hanging out and people (and seal) watching by the harbor, we started our walk up Howth Cliffs. I recommend doing the walk first and saving lunch for after because it’s pretty hard and would be impossible in a fish n chips food coma. There are four walk options, we did the shortest which was about two hours. We played around taking lots of photos, so I guess you could try to do this in an hour and a half, but it’s so beautiful I bet you’ll want to stop for lots of pics, too! The flowers were so pretty all along the cliffs and the water was so BLUE! How stunning is this! Even though I had been here, it was just as beautiful (maybe even more so) this time and I’m glad I came back. We were exhausted after and went for lunch at The Brass Monkey  where Arielle had a huge greasy delicious burger and I had greasy fish n chips with some potato and leak soup. Oh yeah, we had the calamari too because why not!? I am the worst over-ordering on the planet. I think you’d be crazy to go to Dublin and not take time for the coast! This is 10x better than exploring the buildings in Dublin for me. Arielle liked this the most of her whole time abroad. It’s less than 30 minutes from Dublin and 6 Euro to get there and back, so it’s really worth it. That’s our trip to Dublin and Howth in just under 3 days!"https://hippie-inheels.com/travel-tips-for-dublin-ireland/,ireland,"7 Travel Tips for Dublin Ireland So many backpackers don’t make it to Ireland because they don’t want to add an additional flight. That was why I didn’t go my first time to Europe. Even with budget airlines, sometimes flights seem out of the question. I absolutely loved Dublin, although I was there only 4 days. I hope that anyone who is counting Ireland out on their list, pinches a few pennies and gets there! Dublin has old cobblestone streets, vintage pubs, little shops instead of massive malls, and extremely nice people. 7 travel tips you shouldn’t miss in and around Dublin, Ireland. 1. Take the double decker sightseeing bus. Not just for sightseeing, but to save money! I’m aware how lame it sounds. Dublin isn’t the only city where I’ve found this is the case. It was cheaper for us to get a 2 day “student” Dublin Bus Tour pass, at 14 euro, which stops at 23 places, than it would have been to pay for a 2 day metro pass, plus the extra cabs we’d have to take. You can get on and off the tour bus as you like and pick up the next one when you’re ready. It saved money, showed us places we hadn’t realized were worth seeing, and we didn’t have to use as many brain cells staring at maps. Remember to check the tour bus cost in cities you visit to see if a pass can save you transport money! Some of the more memorable places in Dublin on the tour were Trinity College (Oscar Wilde is an Alumni of, and students will give you tours), St. Stephen’s Green, and Kilmainham Gaol, a museum and former prison. 2. Check out the “secret” Dubh Linn gardens where many locals go to have lunch. This is where Dublin gets its name; Dubh Linn meaning Dark Lake. These are located just behind the Dublin Castle, which you can wander around for free. Like most castles, you’ll have to pay to go inside (I didn’t due to budgeting, but will when I go back). 3. Learn to pour the perfect pint of Guinness. To save money, go to the Guinness Storehouse right before it closes and use those free pints as a little pre-game for your night out. After an afternoon nap, the tour bus took us to the Storehouse. Next a tour through the factory learning about hops and other beer related terms, we went to the rooftop at Gravity Bar for a free pint and an amazing view. We actually ended up for a few extra tickets somehow and chugged down as much free Guinness as we could, considering that’s a hard beer to drink fast! We’re told over 10,000,000 glasses are drank a day all over the world! It was only 11 euro to get into the Storehouse. 4. After learning to put the perfect shamrock in the foam of your beer, head to Temple bar, the main area for nightlife, food, and entertainment. But don’t go to Temple Bar neighborhood only at night, it’s full of activity during the day. Wash down your Irish potatoes or stew with a glass of Carlsburg beer and then head out to a pub. We got lucky, there was a Gaelic football game and people were celebrating. So many guys tried to explain what Gaelic Football is and what I got from it is, it’s like American football, except with your feet? You don’t have to stay in Temple bar area to have a good time. Some great pubs include: Temple Bar Pub, the Long Hall, the Porterhouse, Kehoe’s, or Stag’s Head. 5.  Do some shopping! Near St. Stephen’s Green (the tour bus goes here) is a large mall. Or get some very Irish-looking tweed at Kevin &amp; Howlin. The Loft Market has loads of new designers as well as vintage pieces of jewelry and clothing. Also, the last Sunday of every month is a flea market. My favorite place to shop was a local handicraft market outside of Dublin, in Howth. Which brings me to my next point… 6. Get out of Dublin! There are so many little coastal towns you can take the train to for a day trip . Glendalough is very popular, but we chose Howth, a small fishing town. The market in Howth had one of my favorite markets full of breads, cupcakes, jewelry, fudge, nuts, gyros… you name it! The vendors also offered samples. At Howth, we took a long hike up the coastline. Everyone says Ireland is so green, and it did not disappoint! Although it rained, the views were spectacular and the grass was so green and fresh you wanted to roll in it. We saw seals, horses, and a very vintage looking lighthouse. Its so picturesque it’s hard to imagine the people who live there. On the way back from Howth, we stopped at Bray, another coastal town that was having a festival. 7. I did not get a chance to do this in Dublin, but like most cities they offer pub crawls, bike tours, and free walking tours . Our hostel was full of information about these, as most hostels will be. For me, the joys in Ireland were outside of Dublin center. I think it’s like that in a lot of cities because I enjoy the countryside so much more than seeing buildings.  I have barely even touched on all Dublin has to offer, but it’s a huge city and I only had 4 days to wander around. There is SO much more to see, and definitely the kind of place you can’t go to only once. Even if you’re only 5% Irish, you’ll feel just like you belong there! You won’t run out of things to do in Dublin!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/04/hbo-game-thrones-filming-locations-tourist-spots/,ireland,"15 Game of Thrones Filming Locations that You Can Visit It’s that time of the year again! You know that another Game of Thrones season has begun when your Facebook news feed is flooded with cheers of excitement, cries of anger, and death threats for friends who are posting spoilers. It is not difficult to understand why HBO’s highly entertaining and often wildly brutal adaptation of the George RR Martin novels has reached the legendary status in pop culture. It has all the right ingredients: compelling characters, convincing production, unpredictable plot twists, and the right amount of fantasy. And dragons! Put it all together and you get a weekly serving of wonder. Brutal at times, but still pretty mindblowing. But there’s one more thing that always captivates me about this phenomenal hit. On the Season 6 premiere, for instance, when the khalasar made their way to Khal Jhaqo with Daenerys Targaryen in tow, I was so drawn to the arid landscape that surrounded them that I googled it right away. Bardenas Reales in Spain, it turned out. I have been so fascinated with GoT’s choices of filming locations that I have come up with a mission: visit as many of them as I can. The first that I set foot on was Essaouira in Morocco, which was where all Astapor scenes were shot (including that part where Khaleesi freed the Unsullied and ordered them to kill their masters). And when I backpack across Europe later this year, I’m certainly making stops in Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Spain.       So I decided to make a list of the fictional places in the series and their real-life counterparts, where they were primarily filmed. But before we begin, some notes: This list covers exterior shots only. Many of the interior sequences were actually done elsewhere. For example, Dobrovnik’s streets and coastal walls are used mainly for King’s Landing, but interior shots (Red Keep, Iron Throne, etc.) are done in sets in Northern Ireland. This is not 1:1. King’s Landing may be filmed mainly in Dubrovnik, but they also took supplementary footage of Essaouira and Malta as the Westeros capital. Dubrovnik also stood in for the City of Qarth in Season 2. Many of these sites have been digitally modified or enhanced by the show. Winterfell, for example, is almost unrecognizable as Castle Ward. This is not complete. I will update this as the series moves forward. Now that we got the caveats out of the way, here it is: a Game of Thrones fan’s travel bucket list! WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland 9. Pentos: Malta 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia The ancient port city of Dubrovnik has seen a steady increase in tourism since they first used it to depict King’s Landing in Season 1. Executive Producer David Benioff said, “The first time we saw Dubrovnik, I was in shock, because the whole city really looked the way we pictured King’s Landing looking.” 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland Castle Ward tower digitally modified to create Winterfell The vast 1000-acre grounds surrounding Castle Ward has hosted the production team as they bring to life many of the series’ key moments, including scenes featuring Winterfell, seat of the House Stark and capital of the North. Much of the first 2 seasons took advantage of the sheer size of its grassy farmyard, perfect for army camp sequences, and ancient structures including Audley’s Castle. 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland The Magheramorne Quarry is an abandoned limestone quarry in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is where the Castle Black set was installed. (It has also been used as Hardhome and the city walls of King’s Landing in Season 2’s Blackwater episode.) It is currently not accessible to the public, but there are pending plans of reopening it as a mountain biking center. Fingers crossed. 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland Iceland as Wildling and White Walker territory Iceland in real life Most of the events north of the Wall of Westeros are realized in Iceland. This includes the glacier at Snæfellsjökull (I don’t even know how to pronounce that properly) which was used as the Fist of the First Men; Mývatn Lake, a frozen lava lake close to the town of Akureyri, which was where Mance Rayder’s wildling group dwelled; and Grjótagjá Cave, where Jon Snow and Ygritte had a very wet consummation of their love. 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain Alcázar of Seville as Sunspear in Dorne Alcázar of Seville in reality Dorne was actually what I was so excited to see on television. I just thought it had the most character. Dorne, the southernmost region of the Seven Kingdoms, in the books was actually inspired by medieval Spain, so it totally makes sense that they chose Seville as location, including Sunspear, seat of House Martell, which was actually the Alcázar of Seville in reality. This season, fans are also excited to see the Tower of Joy, which was said to be Castillo de Zafra, a 12th-century castle in Guadalajara. 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland Also known as “raised beach,” Ballintoy Harbor in County Antrim can take pride in being real-life Iron Islands. Images of this picturesque harbor were digitally enhanced to mimic the jaw-dropping seascape of Pyke and Lordsport. You remember that scene where Theon Greyjoy first meets his sister Yara? That was shot here. 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland Stannis Baratheon’s bailiwick is actually Downhill Strand, a beach destination in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It’s where Stannis and Melisandre set the Seven idols on fire and where Davos allowed Gendry to flee. 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland Kingsroad Do you remember when Arya, Yoren, Gendry, and Hot Pie were on the way to the Wall after escaping King’s Landing? Did you notice the beautiful avenue flanked with rows of eerie but beautiful trees? That’s the Dark Hedges of Armoy, which in the GoT world is Kingsroad. It is actually a road of beech trees, which according to Northern Ireland’s tourism website , were planted in the 18th century by the Stuart family “to impress visitors as they approached the entrance to their Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.” 9. Pentos: Malta See that arch in the background? That’s the Azure Window, a famous feature of the Maltese Island of Gozo. Azure Window IRL. And now we go all the way back to Season 1. The Mediterranean archipelago of Malta has been home to the GoT team for many days, too, mostly during the filming of Pentos. In particular, the 16th century Verdala Palace, the official summer residence of the Maltese President, stood in for the mansion of Illyrio Mopatis, the merchant-prince who sold Daenerys to Khal Drogo in marriage. The wedding feast then took place in Gozo Island, the second largest island in Malta. 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia Meereen, the largest city that Daenerys Targaryen has conquered and ruled so far, is the Croatian city of Split in real life. Situated on the coast of Dalmatia, this picturesque city faces the Adriatic Sea. Among the sites used in the series is the Diocletian’s Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site, whose cellars provided replacement for the underground passages in Meereen. 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia Šibenik, a quiet medieval town in Central Dalmatia, Croatia, made its GoT debut in Season 5 as the free city of Braavos, where Arya Stark found herself after sailing from Westeros and where the Iron Bank is located. 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco Essaouira as Astapor Essaouira in real life The port city of Essaouira along the Atlantic coast of Morocco serves as Astapor, one of the cities in Slaver’s Bay. Essaouira is where most scenes in Astapor was shot, including the unforgettable and iconic scene wherein Daenerys Targaryen bought and freed the Unsullied, and then ordered her dragons to attack. Dracarys! 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco Aït-Ben-Haddou as Yunkai Aït-Ben-Haddou IRL. Also in Morocco is the old city of Aït-Ben-Haddou, a fortified city on the edge of the great Sahara desert. It’s no stranger to movies as it has been the setting for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), and Prince of Persia (2010) among others. But in the GoT world, Aït-Ben-Haddou is Yunkai, aka Yellow City and one of the three great city-states in Slaver’s Bay. 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain Vaes Dothrak has yet to be featured, but rumor has it that the team tapped the exotic charms of Almeria, a city in Andalusia, Spain, for this. We’ll see in the coming episodes. 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Many places have been used to depict the many parts of Dothraki Sea, but in the Season 6 premiere, the place we casually refer to as “wherever the fuck Drogon dropped Daenerys” is Bardenas Reales, the 100,000-acre badlands in southeast Navarre, Spain. "https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,ireland,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://hippie-inheels.com/visiting-jerusalem-israel/,israel,"What it’s like visiting Jerusalem, Israel Jerusalem was my first place to explore in Israel and I’m glad of that. It’s much easier to navigate than huge Tel Aviv and has a smaller town vibe making it a place you can ease into Israel. Visiting Jerusalem Israel For me there wasn’t much to ease into. A guide asked what I thought of some of the more run down areas and I said they look great to me, after all I live in India where the idea of run down is a lot different unfortunately. I also have traveled in Jordan which has similar terrain and food. Seeing different cultures mingle is the norm in India where people are Sikh, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and more. In Jerusalem I did expect mostly Orthodox Jews, and it is a more Orthodox city than Tel Aviv, but actually it was much more of a mix than I thought and most Orthodox Jews I saw were in the Old Town. People dressed how they pleased. You might notice small things like the McDonalds (yes, I had one!) was kosher here meaning that the dairy and meat can’t be mixed (no cheeseburgers for you) and it is okay’ed by a Jewish Rabbi. I was told that in Tel Aviv this isn’t the case and you can have non-kosher restaurants, even the chain ones. So as a whole, Jerusalem is a holy city and the vibe is a little more Orthodox, but really only in the Old Town do you need to think about how you dress. The nightlife here is booming and in the last 10 years bars have popped up all over. The people here LOVE to party and it seems like at all times an Isreali was putting a beer, shot, or glass of wine in my hand. photo via  Matanya Tausig Turn on your JavaScript to view content As for neighborhoods, we stayed in the Downtown Triangle, which was full of life with cafes, bars, and shops all around. It is just 10 minutes walking from the Mahane Yehuda Market . This market sells fruit and veg, bread, and snacks in the day but at night-time comes alive when the stalls pull down their metal gates (which are covered in graffiti) and the bars start blasting music. It’s the perfect place to bar hop and have dinner. This area has lots of little shops but I did find the clothes here very expensive and not top quality (think overpriced Charlotte Russe). Bit of a shame because Isrealis have the cutest clothes, so I obviously wasn’t finding the best shops here. For style, they dress very laid back. I didn’t see girls out with heels on and little dress, but more like tennis shoes, boots, skinny jeans, flowy or crop tops, and hippy dresses. Most of the guys have very long curly hair with highlights in it from the sun and also dress super laid back. It’s definitely a hipster vibe all over this country. Although Isreali food is delicious, you can eat anything here and we ended up at a delicious pizza place on our second night out. We were meant to eat at the famous Yudale restaurant but it was packed. There is a tapas bar across the restaurant which was really lively. I never had a bad meal in Israel so I imagine you could pop in anywhere and you’d be happy. Most places had lots of locals in them so you know it’s good. So other than eat and drink what is there to do in Jerusalem? Seeing the Old Town. This is the historical bit of Jerusalem and hosts all of the major attractions including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where Jesus was crucified, put in a tomb, and later arose. I am going to share about this in another post because there is a lot to show and tell. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Where to stay when visiting Jerusalem Israel I’ll share where I stayed and a couple other options you can consider based on budget. I stayed at the Herbet Samuel Hotel . It’s more boutique, middle-range, and about $150 per night. This is right on the “Downtown Triangle” and the ideal location for where to stay in Jerusalem. We did go to the Abraham Hostel for rooftop beers and to meet up for our day’s tour to the Old Town. It was packed with backpackers and even families. They do have private rooms. This hostel is one of the top 10 in the world (recently voted by hostelworld) and a great place to mingle and explore the city while staying on a budget. photo via  Matanya Tausig If you want to splurge out, the Mamilla Hotel is a super luxurious boutique option that goes for about $450 a night."https://hippie-inheels.com/experiences-in-tel-aviv/,israel,"9 Epic Experiences in Tel Aviv You Don’t Want to Miss Tel Aviv blew me away. I don’t think I’ve ever gone to a city and just immediately felt so attached to it and alive! Instead of writing on and on about how I felt, I want to tell you what experiences in Tel Aviv made me feel this way. These are the experiences in Tel Aviv that you do NOT want to miss out on when you visit, and if you aren’t planning a trip- these are the reasons you should be. FYI most of these photos (all the ones I am in) were taken by Matanya Tausig . 9 Experiences in Tel Aviv You’ll Love 1. Surf Vibes and Tan Lines Maybe you didn’t know, but this is a surfer’s city. There is also SUP and kitesurfing around. I love the switch from office to beach here because the beach is right up in the city. The vibe all across Tel Aviv is laid back. I knew Israelis in Goa were laid-back, but overall Tel Aviv had that chilled out vibe. There was an opportunity to surf but I could NOT get out of bed. I was so tired each night I couldn’t bring myself to set my alarm even earlier than I already had to get up. FYI beer on the beach is a fortune. #BeforeIDie I want to spend a day at the beach in Tel Aviv on the Mediterranean Sea! 2. Sharing a Shabbat Dinner with a Sweet Local Family Thinking that I just got to do this because I was on a blogging trip? Actually, you will be surprised to find that you will be invited into nearly every Israeli you meet’s home. They love to host! If you mention to someone you want to try a Shabbat dinner, chances are they’ll invite you to one. This family wasn’t super religious but does this is as a tradition. I think it was cool to see that there are so many types of Jewish people who focus on religion in different ways or are Jewish but not actually religious. 3. Doing Graffiti + Exploring Art in Tel Aviv I loved this tour and wrote a whole article about graffiti in Tel Aviv because it was that cool. There are many companies who do graffiti tours, and I suggest you reach out to them if you want to understand the art you’re seeing. If you just want to check it out casually, you can just walk the streets yourself. There are loads of cool cafes and shops in this area, which is Florentine and in the South parts of Tel Aviv.  4. Staying in affordable boutique hotels There are an unlimited amount of cool boutique hotels in Tel Aviv. Prices here, in general, are high, so you’ll be shocked to know hostels can cost up to $70. If you are sharing a room and happy to spend a little extra, check out this list of boutique hotels in Tel Aviv . Some start as low as $150 a night. PS: If you are looking for a boutique/luxury planned out tour I met a woman who runs them in Israel called Tova who you can check out! 5. The Epic Tel Aviv Nightlife Can’t beat a good party and Tel Aviv knows how to throw one. In fact, at all times someone was trying to put a drink in my hand and when I resisted for days I became the “sober” girl who they called me in Hebrew. Finally, I gave in on our big night out and had some drinks. Here are the places we hit up: Port Said (Har Sinai Street 5) where you need a reservation for sure! Drinks were great and food was better. met with mixologists and learned a bit about it at French 57 (Brenner Street 2). My drink was bourbon based of course! This bar has a New Orleans vibe. Next up SpeakEasy (Rothschild 24). This is a cool rooftop bar to chill out and actually have some conversations (you won’t remember). Jimmy Who was kind of connected to SpeakEasy, or just right outside. You cannot bring your drink from one to the other and if you try, as I did, you will get yelled at haha! Sputnik (Allenby 122), for end of night clubbing. My night ended here, but next up was Breakfast Club. I knew my early morning wake up (this WAS a work trip after all) would make me regret pulling an all-nighter, so I went home at 3 AM. Breakfast Club is open til at least 9 AM. While I didn’t go out, my friend Trish did. She’s a party animal. She gave even more tips on her nightlife guide to Tel Aviv . 6. Renting Bicycles to Tour Tel Aviv We used the cities green bicycles to get around for an early afternoon. Tel Aviv is pretty huge, at least it felt that way to me. I hadn’t ridden a bike in forever but turns out the saying is right, you can’t forget. It was one of my favorite things to do in Tel Aviv ! 7. It’s a Cafe Culture Do Tel Avivians work? Apparently, yet at all times the cafe are full on young awesomely dressed people chilling out, having a beer, and eating some of the best food I’ve ever tried. Isreal food isn’t just veggie salad as is on most international menus, but it’s Mediterranean style food, which means lots of great seafood. You don’t have to eat Israeli though. There are pizza places, pub food, burgers, you name it. Long late lunches are necessary. 8. Shop ‘Til You Drop, Tel Aviv Style That means you need Tel Aviv money, which I don’t have! I’ve always thought Israelis had a great laid-back bohemian style, based on the girls I see in Goa. Their clothes aren’t from India, so I know they must be getting them back home. I was really excited to find their shops! Mindy, another girl on the trip, had Israeli friends and was always keen to emulate their style. I have to say I was a little let down. The road we were on shopping near the beach (near CUCU hotel) had overpriced low-quality clothing. During our graffiti tour I saw the shop Shir Gershovitz  and was obsessed with her clothes. I couldn’t afford them though. From there, every shop I saw was the cutest. These clothes were all so expensive for me though. If you have money to blow, you will love shopping here in the Neve Tzedek area. I did also find some jewelry that was affordable and super cute called Feathers Art &amp; Heart. Definitely check out the Jaffa flea market too. 9. Dining in the Dark There are only 10 blackout restaurants in the world and one is Na Lagaat in Tel Aviv. In the photo below, we are walking in about to be totally surprised as none of us knew we would be trying this, funnily enough, we are almost all wearing black. The experience started with us learning about the projects this place does, for example putting on shows done by deaf/blind people who take years to get ready. The chefs and waiters in the restaurant are all blind. We did a test to see how we could communicate blind and epicly  failed. As we walked in, they kept saying don’t be nervous. I thought, well I’m not. It’s just the dark. But once we got inside it was totally blacked out. You had to sit down and then you stay put. You have to figure out how to pour your water, dip your bread in sauce, and of course, eat with your hands. Our waiter told us his story and it brought tears to one in the group. We were all quite moved by it. This is an experience I won’t forget. Although, I could do without Vaughan making a sneezing noise and flicking water to make it seem like he sneezed on us LOL such a funny guy!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/04/milan-sample-itinerary-italy/,italy,"Milan: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Itinerary by Unique Tours Factory Milan: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Itinerary by Unique Tours Factory Unique Tours Factory (UFT) is a new private tour company operating in fifteen European cities with sixty professional and seasoned guides and one hundred and twenty exceptional tours.

Don’t get me wrong- I like to travel so I can soak in the culture, but here are my top three things to do while traveling 1. Outdoor adventure 2. Shop 3. Take photos of little kids (in a non-creepy way). Before I go anywhere I like to know what I can BUY there. I pack less so I can shop more. When I look back at all the places I have been shopping, the markets of Florence still call me back. My biggest travel regret from my first trip was not buying a leather jacket that I bargained down to 100 euro. Its magnificence haunts my dreams. Here are my tips and guide maneuvering the San Lorenzo market of Florence. San Lorenzo Market Florence The main market, Mercado di San Lorenzo , is the trap that got me. A friend that lived in Florence gave me a talking-to about the rip-offs. Many of the items here are straight from factories in Asia, and although still real leather, they aren’t the always GOOD leather Italy is known for. You’re hoping to pay 50-80 Euro for a nice bag that maybe cost them 20 Euro. Though, her and I both did get amazing deals here. I have a grey handbag and purple leather wallet that have lasted 4 years without signs of breakdown. I bought leather driving gloves (that I’ve obviously never worn because I’m not a car-racing, scotch-drinking, gentlemen.) I bought scarves for presents back home that were supposedly pashmina/silk. Scarves are one of the hardest things to shop for because the many materials vary in extremes of price and it’s difficult to notice the differences. After being around so much cashmere in India, now I can tell if the scarf is really cashmere. If you want quality, luxury leather I suggest you do research for acclaimed shops in Florence. I don’t have advice on this because I am just fine with mediocre Italian leather from San Lorenzo Market. An equivalent to the bag I got in Florence would have cost me over 300 in the U.S. guaranteed. I adore Fossil bags because of the soft leather, and that’s how so many of the bags in Florence were. No matter where I see leather bags, I picture the market in Florence and regret not buying more colors or at least a cross-body! I like to shop in the evening, near closing time. This is because I get two things at once- a sunset and a good deal. Closing time means the vendor is getting his last deals of the day and may lower prices for that extra bit of cash. In the morning this never happens because they have the whole day ahead of them. For a sunset that will sear into your brain, look for views from Ponte Santa Trinita (Holy Trinity Bridge). As always, negotiate the cost . I got quite a large handbag made of extraordinary leather for 55 Euro that started out at 110 Euro. If buying more than one item, you should make sure to get a deal for quantity. Negotiate the lowest price for each individual item you want to buy, and then add those prices together. Say, you want 3 things each offered to you at 40 euro, then discounted to 20, tell the vendor you’ll take all three for 50. Remember, if the vendor is mean to you, there are going to be more of the same product just another stall down. Don’t be afraid to walk away, many times they will call after you and agree to your price. Lastly, make sure you’re happy when you’re shopping. Sad people don’t like anything and you’ll find yourself out of Florence, cheered up, regretting not buying all the beautiful jewelry, bags, and scarves. Best way to cheer up from homesickness or lovesickness in Italy: Gelato!! Gelato and Pizza.  Head to Piazzale Della Michelangelo for great views from atop the hill and some delicious gelato, then do your shopping. By the time you’re done shopping, all you will want to do is sleep! Other things to do in Florence: Practice your photography skills in the alleys of this renaissance town Check out beautiful marble of the Duomo, named the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore Enjoy the copy of Michaelangelo’s David in the main square, Piazza della Signoria. To see the real thing, head to the Galleria dell’ Acedemia. There are plenty of other statues to admire as well. Do some jewelry shopping along Ponte Vecchio, another great place to watch the cotton candy sunset. There is nothing better than an Italian cotton candy sunset! Stroll along the bridge for street performers, shopping, and great views."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/08/florence-travel-guide-itinerary/,italy,"FLORENCE ON A BUDGET: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary When we walked past the Duomo on our last night, the air carried a familiar classical tune coming from a string quartet positioned along an adjacent alley. The drizzling had stopped and a small crowd had gathered around them. Suddenly, a little boy took his mother’s hand and together they danced to the melody, to the delight of other tourists, who watched and snapped away.       It’s tender moments like this that made our time in this glorious city for keeps. I felt it as soon as we emerged out of the Santa Maria Novella Station when we arrived in the city. Trying to find our guesthouse, we walked with 30+ kilos of luggage on our back. It’s been a long, tiring ride from Zurich and we could definitely use some rest. The concrete pavement turned into cobblestones, the streets turned to narrow alleys. It was quiet. It was as though we were never tired. And for a moment, I felt like Diane Lane (hahahahahhaahhaha), playing with the Tuscan sun, peeking from the top of the heritage buildings. Then one left turn and we were greeted by a massive swarm of people, all admiring the Duomo. Hello there, fellow tourists. We never expected to fall in love with Florence. When we were planning this 16-country European tour, I prepared for Paris or Reykjavik to take my breath away, but it was Florence who stole my heart and ran with it. Easily, it became my favorite city. (Yosh’s most-loved remains Paris, though. But he’s a Francophile, so that’s not really surprising.)   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Florence The city was founded as early as 59 B.C. During the medieval times, it was one of the wealthiest cities in Europe. But it is best known for giving life to the Renaissance in the 14th century, the period that gave us Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo. Many factors contributed to the rise of Florence as a cultural epicenter. One of them: its ruling clan, the Medici, were huge patrons of the arts. Art is the heart and soul of Firenze, which continues to inspire artists from around the world. Its streets are bursting with captivating architecture, sculptures, and even musicians and street painters trying to make a living. Today’s Florence is a metropolitan hub and the capital of Italy’s Tuscan region, but its historic core remains intact, tucked at its center. It has 80 museums, not counting outside galleries that adorn its many piazzas. The city’s Old Town attracts 13 million tourists a year, making it one of the most visited cities in the world. Language : Italian. Most signs have English translations. Currency : Euro (EUR, €). €1 is roughly $1.11, PHP 55.94 (as of June 2017). Modes of payment : Many establishments accept credit cards, but most still prefer cash. Electricity Info : 220-240 volts. Plugs have two round pins.   When to visit Florence In general, the period between October to May is alright, but April is the most comfortable weather-wise. This is when the cold is slowly giving way to the summer heat. It gets much hotter in the next months and peaks in August, the month you want to avoid. Even the locals try to go out of town during this month to escape the heat. If you enjoy winter, January and February may be a great choice for two reasons: lower prices, thinner crowds. Florence is always jampacked almost any time of the year, regardless of weather conditions. During our visit, we noticed that even in the middle of rain showers, the piazzas remain brimming with tourists, especially the area surrounding the Duomo.   How to Get to Florence Florence is served by Amerigo Vespucci Airport (FLR) , an international airport situated just 30 minutes from the city center. But the Galileo Galilei Airport in Pisa is the largest in Tuscany. Because the the two airports are connected by rail and bus, Pisa is also a good gateway to Florence. Pisa Airport also serves many of Europe’s low-cost carriers including EasyJet, RyanAir, Transavia, and Thomsonfly.   From Pisa From Pisa Airport’s Terminal 1, you can board the train to Firenze SMN Station. Multiple trains ply this route per day so reservation is not needed. Just buy a ticket when you arrive. The journey takes 1.5 hours. Fare is fixed at €11.10.   From Rome, Milan, or Venice If you’re on a bigger tour around Italy, you can easily reach Florence from Rome, Milan, Venice and other Italian cities by train. There are multiple trains a day, but because Trenitalia uses dynamic pricing (much like how airlines work), it is best to book in advance. If you don’t have fixed plans yet, you can book on the same day, but expect to pay more for your seat. Fare starts at €19.90. You can pre-book a train on the Trenitalia website at www.trenitalia.com .   From Other European Cities If you’re coming from other cities in Europe, the fast and cheap option is usually flying. Intercity flights within Europe are surprisingly cheap and they will save you a lot of time. However, there are also trains available coming from outside Italy. There are day trains and overnight trains, depending on where you’re coming from. Often they make stops in another Italian City, usually Milan or Turin. From Paris . The cheapest option is to travel by high-speed to Turin (Travel time: 5h40; Fares from €29). Then, board an Italian train from Turin to Florence (Travel time: 2h45; Fares from €19.90). Book the Italian train with Trenitalia. From Zurich, Switzerland . Take a EuroCity train to Milan (Travel time: 3h26; Fare from €9) and then board an Italian train to Florence (Travel time: 1h40; Fare from €19.90). From Munich, Germany . Travel with German Railways to Verona, Bologna, or Venice (Fare starts at €9). Then take an Italian train to Florence SMN (Fare from €19.90).ole trip, but this does   From Manila If you’re a Filipino citizen, you’ll need a Schengen visa. Here’s how to get a Schengen visa . There are no direct flights from the Philippines to Florence. Most routes entail a few layovers. A good option is to fly to Pisa instead. Pisa is easily accessible. Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways fly to Pisa with stops in Istanbul and Doha respectively.   How to Get from Florence Airport to Florence Historical Center The fastest way to get to Historic Center from Florence Airport is by bus. Bus ticket price for single trip is €5 (P281.25 or $5.57) and €8 (P449.35 or $8.92) for round-trip ticket. Take the Volainbus, operating from 06:00AM to 11:30PM and departs every 30 minutes in front of the airport. It will take you directly to Santa Maria Novella (SMN) Train Station, which is located just next to the Old Town. _________   How to Stay Connected in Florence, Italy If you want to stay internet connected for navigation and social media purposes, you have a few options: using a local SIM card, pocket wi-fi, or roaming.   Local SIM If you own an open-line or unlocked phone (meaning, your phone can accept SIM cards from other carriers), this is your cheapest option. Italy has four main telco companies: Vodafone, TIM, Tre, and WIND. The first two have the best coverage and 4G data connection. TIM for Visitors . Cost: 30€. Includes 4GB of 4G internet, 100 minutes of international and national calls, and a SIM Card. Valid for 30 days. The price is fixed, but you will be encouraged to top-up to get more data, especially if you’re a heavy user. Vodafone Holiday . Cost: 30€. Includes 2GB of 4G data, 300 minutes and 300 SMS to all Italian numbers and to your home country, and a SIM Card. There is a 1€ maintaining balance. Before you decide to buy an Italian SIM, take note of the following: You can only get one at the physical store or booth . Activation can’t be done online. The tricky part is that it can be challenging if you don’t speak Italian, so make sure you know exactly what plan you want before approaching any store staff to avoid confusion. Note that the name of TIM’s holiday package is “TIM for Visitors” and Vodafone’s is “Vodafone Holiday.” Bring your passport to the store. SIM registration upon activation is required by law. Have the staff set up the APN on your phone to be sure you have the settings right . This changes depending on the device you use. If you’re a heavy data user, top up after activation so you don’t need to return to the store in the middle of your trip.   Pocket Wifi Rental You can rent out pocket wifi before your flight. If you’re coming from the Philippines, one of the brands you can use is Flytpack. Flytpack charges P500 per day for Europe and an additional P2800 deposit, which you can get back after your trip. Because it can connect multiple devices, you can split cost with your companions. The unit comes with a built-in power bank, which ensures you get to use it for an entire day tour without draining the battery. Each rental comes with a universal adaptor. Super useful!   Roaming If you’re based in the Philippines, you can also use your provider’s roaming services. Rates will vary depending on your provider. Globe Telecom : They have lots of roaming options. You can choose the Roam Viber (P199) or Roam Facebook (P299) for 24 hours. Or choose the unli data roaming for P599. You can check all their rates by accessing Globe Roaming Page Smart : They also have the unli data roaming service called Surf Abroad for P550 or their TravelWifi for P390 per day with 1GB data for 24 hours. You can check the their website for more info –&gt; Smart Travelling The World This isn’t the most economical option, but roaming has its own advantages. Postpaid roaming is activated automatically, so you don’t need to register or visit a store or make a deposit. You also don’t have an extra gadget to charge and take care of during the trip. And if you’re a group, you can turn on personal hotspot or tethering to split the cost. Where to Stay in Florence If you can, stay within the city’s historical center so you don’t need to worry about transportation going to major attractions. The Old Town is also just a short walk from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). Several cheap guesthouses and hostels are located in the area, so finding a place shouldn’t be a problem if you book in advance.   Where We Stayed: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address: Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy Bronze Horse is a two-room shared apartment space being rented out to tourists. It’s located on the third floor of an old building at the heart of Florence’s Old Town. The two rooms share a single bathroom, so consider that if you’re interested to book this. To be honest, we hesitated booking this because there were some horrible reviews. But its location is so good, we took a leap of faith. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. Still, make sure you have prior check-in arrangements before arrival. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : We paid €50 for a double room with shared bathroom. This doesn’t include €2.50 City tax per person per night. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha.   Top Budget Hotels Under €50 Below are the top-rated hotels in the area as scored by Traveloka users.

In fact, many streets are for pedestrians only and block car access. However, it can still be very confusing. Google Maps should be able to help you with navigating. But if you want to explore the more modern side of Florence, you can take the bus or the tram. The T1 tram line runs from Villa Costanza (Scandicci) to Santa Maria Novella (SMN) station. You can buy your tram tickets from the SMN Station or any authorized establishment — pharmacy, coffee shops, newspaper stands — that has a “ATAF” sticker. There are many types of tickets available. The ordinary ticket can be used once and is valid for 90 minutes. Best to book in advance because it costs more if you buy the ticket onboard. But there are also multiple ride tickets, which you can use multiple times within the same 90-minute period. Here are the costs: 1 ticket x 90 minutes (pre-booked): €1.20 1 ticket x 90 minutes (onboard): €2.00 2 Tickets x 90 minutes: €2.40 4 ticket x90 minutes: €4.70 Longer-duration tickets are also available, if you plan on using the tram and bus systems frequently. 24-hour ticket: €5 3-day ticket: €12 7-day ticket: €18 You can also use the ATAF tickets on the bus.   Guided Walking Tours Although touring Florence can be done DIY-style, you’ll be able to appreciate the city and its history more if you join a guided tour.

Reserve Now   Where to Eat in Florence Florence has a wide, rich collection of dining spots, from small panini booths to family-run trattorias to more upscale restaurants. You’ll never run out of options. It’s just a matter of finding the good ones. The challenge is finding those that fit your budget. In general, restaurants in the main squares of the Historical Center are bad, expensive, or both. But all you need to do is walk a little bit father and you’ll find more promising choices. Here are some of those we tried with their respective price ranges and locations. We’ll be providing short descriptions because we’ll be publishing more detailed reviews in a separate post. Trattoria Mario . This restaurant has been for around 60 years. A highly recommended restaurant if you want to dig in to some home-cooked Italian food. Much of Trattoria Mario’s menu changes every day, but of course they get repeated sometimes. Some permanent favorites are their Bistecca Florentina, which is always served rare, and lombatina or roast veal. It’s probably the best cheap restaurant meal we tried in the city. Because it’s open only during lunch time (closed for dinner), the place is always bursting with diners. We shared our table with an American expat couple, who have been living in Florence for over 12 years, and this was also their go-to place for some great Italian food.Address: Via Rosina, 2r, 50123 FirenzeOpening Hours: Monday-Saturday 12:00nn – 3:30pmClosed Sunday and holidays Price Range: €8 to €35 Trattoria Anita . One of our best dining experiences happened here at Trattoria Anita, which stands just a block away from our guesthouse. We arrived 5 minutes before the 7pm opening but in just a minute, the place was packed with mostly locals. There were only two tables with tourists during our visit, our table included. The food was flavorful, the atmosphere was warm and homey, and the staff was very friendly. The menu was in Italian but our waiter explained to usAddress: Via del Parlascio, 2, 50122 FirenzeOpening Hours: 12nn-3pm, 7-11pmPrice Range: €7 to €20 Panini Toscani . It’s a humble hole-in-the-wall panini place, but it’s quite popular, judging by the looong queue that snaked from the store to the edge of the Duomo during our visit. We decided to return in the late afternoon, which was a great decision because by then, the queue was no more. When we approached the counter, the staff asked us if it was our first time and when we said yes, they meticulously explained in great detail each ingredient — each type of cheese and meat, where they are from, how they are made — and asked us to taste everything before making our choices. It was an educational experience, a simple gesture that made our stay there a memory for keeps.Address: Piazza del Duomo, 34R, 50122 Firenze, Italy Price Range: €11 to €20 I’ Vinaino Restaurant .Our experience on this restaurant was superb and food didn’t disappoint.

If you’re not interested in touring Tuscany, you can just spend another day exploring Florence. That would bring the cost down to only €275 (USD 328, PHP 16,800) . Staying at a dorm will also reduce costs, so it’s something to consider, especially if you’re traveling alone or with friends.   Other Tips for the Poor Traveler Tipping at restaurants is not compulsory in Italy . The norm is simply to round up the bill. Say the bill is €38.50, you can simply pay €40 and leave the change. Of course, you’re free to tip more if you’re happy and satisfied with the service. Restaurants in Italy charges “coperto” (except in the Lazio region including Rome). If you see coperto or coperto servizio or pane e coperto on your bill, it’s normal. It’s basically cover/service charge, and the figure differs per restaurant. Often it’s somewhere between €2 and €3, but it can go lower or higher. At Trattoria di Mario, the coperto is at €0.5, while in some restaurants it can go as high as €5. There are free walking tours around Florence . The meeting place is usually in front of the Santa Maria Novella Church, next to the obelisk. It’s free, yes, and the guide just relies on tips. Not that we recommend it. There are still questions about the ethics of free walking tours. But it’s up to you. Do not exchange currencies at money changers especially in touristy areas . I repeat, NOT at the money changers. They charge huge fees and the exchange rates are terrible! Always exchange money at a bank or withdraw from an ATM from your home bank account. Get your tax refund before leaving Europe. If you decide to go shopping, ask the store for a tax-free form. Have it filled out and then when it’s time to leave, you can have the form Customs approved and then claim the refund. You’re eligible if you’re not an EU resident and you paid at least €154.94 to a single shop. You can even claim refund for items you bought from other EU countries. Likewise, you can claim refund for products you bought in Italy at other EU airport. For example, if you buy a gadget in Rome and you’re leaving Europe via Paris, you can process the refund in Paris. Make sure you bring the gadget with you because they will need to see it."https://hippie-inheels.com/the-10-best-kept-secrets-in-florence-you-wont-want-to-miss/,italy,"The 10 Best-Kept Secrets In Florence You Won’t Want To Miss Florence, Italy is visited by over 16 million tourists each year, and it is easy to see why. In my year living and working in this city straight out of the Renaissance, I completely fell for the charm, history, and culture in Firenze. It can be hard to find the best-kept secrets in Florence, so we’re going to help you out. In a city so filled with tourists, it can be easy to get caught up in Florence’s main attractions. While the Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, and Uffizi truly are amazing, if you are planning a visit to the city, you’ll want to make time to see some of Florence’s hidden gems. To help you discover the city’s lesser-known treasures, I’m sharing the top 10 best-kept secrets in Florence! Shh…don’t tell…or do! ;) Best-Kept Secrets In Florence 1. The view from San Miniato If you are looking to take an amazing photo of Florence or watch the sun set over the city, most people will direct you to the famous Piazzale Michelangelo. While the view from the Piazzale is excellent, just a short walk away you’ll find San Miniato. This 12th-century church is one of the oldest in Florence, and the view is simply incredible. You’ll also find that it isn’t packed with tourists, as the the Piazzale often is. 2. Artisans in Florence In Florence, you are sure to encounter plenty of “artisans” selling their wares on the streets of Florence. While you may find genuine art on the streets of Florence, keep and eye out for mass-produced souvenirs, and try visiting an artisan instead. My personal favorite is the “secret” jewelry workshop of Giuliano Ricchi. There is no sign to find the building where the workshop is located, and you must know which buzzer to press when entering. Despite the lack of signage, inside the shop, there is an abundance of handmade jewelry at fair prices. Giuliano himself may actually give you a tour of his work space! You can read more about where to find this artisan here . 3. Shh…it’s a Secret…Bakery The secret bakeries of Florence are quite popular among night owls and study abroad students, but these late-night bakeries often go unnoticed by visitors to Florence. The reason why? The secret bakeries of Florence often don’t open until 2 AM or later. If you find yourself awake and looking for a late night snack, be sure to stop by one of these bakeries. You won’t find a sign, you’ll just have to trust your nose and follow the scent of freshly baked croissants (or the sound of college students heading home from the clubs). For 1 euro, you’ll end up with a delicious freshly baked good long before the local cafes are open. 4. The Vasari Corridor The Vasari corridor is a hidden passageway in Florence that connects the Palazzo Vecchio with the Palazzo Pitti. The corridor was originally built by the Medici family to connect the Uffizi to the palace where the family resided. Today, you’ll have to make reservations in advance to visit, as much of the corridor is closed to the public. 5. The Appenine Colossus Just a bus ride away from Florence lies the amazing  Colosso dell’Appennino, or Appenine Colossus. While I wouldn’t recommend a visit if you are only in Florence for a short time, if you have some time to play with and really love art, then you won’t want to miss this gigantic 16th century statue. If you don’t have time to visit the park, the famous Boboli gardens in Florence now house many works that were relocated from the Villa Demidoff. You can learn more about the park and how to get there here . 6. Street Art Everywhere Okay, so if you are pretty observant this one won’t be a secret for you, but for those of you struggling to take your eyes off the beautiful architecture of the city, you may overlook the street art scene in Florence. Throughout the city, you’ll find plenty of street art done by local artists. I especially recommend trying to find Blub’s underwater scenes. You’ll also see many street signs that have been cleverly re-designed by Clet. He is so popular there is even a retail location in Florence where you can purchase your own print or sticker! 7. Rooftop Bars The rooftop bars in Florence are some of my favorite places to spend an afternoon, sipping cocktails with friends enjoying amazing views of the city. While these bars aren’t exactly hidden, they aren’t easy to detect from the ground! You’ll find many of them above hotels, or even above the popular shopping center La Rinascente. Be sure to treat yourself to evening relaxing at one of my 5 favorite rooftop bars in Florence ! 8. The city’s smaller museums Florence is famous for it’s museums, particularly the incredible Uffizi Gallery and the Accademia. These museums are certainly worth a visit, but I’m also so in love with Florence’s many smaller museums. The Bargello and Museo di San Marco are two of my favorites, and they usually don’t have lines! 9. Florence’s best restaurants There are so many places to eat in Florence, which can be really overwhelming to a first time visitor. To help you sift through the tourist traps and get to the best food in town, I’ve compiled a list of the top 30 places to eat and drink in Florence . From the best fancy restaurants to the most delicious pizza and gelato, your tastebuds will thank you for taking the time too seek out the yummiest food in town! 10. The side streets of Florence Many times when walking around Florence it can feel like there are tourists (and selfie stick salesmen) everywhere. So go ahead and get lost-often times the best hidden gems I’ve discovered when walking outside the beaten path and main tourist locations. One of the best places to escape the crowds is Oltrarno, or the “other side” of the Arno river. This neighborhood is fall less crowded and has a more low-key and local vibe. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and get lost in my favorite city, and discover Florence’s best kept secrets for yourself!"https://hippie-inheels.com/travel-tips-for-venice/,italy,"10 Travel Tips for Venice.. &amp; Going to Rehab I have to admit my time in Venice was not well spent. You know when you’ve been traveling too long and you just feel tired? You don’t want to take any photos, talk to anyone, or sightsee? That was my Venice. Although, that didn’t stop me from shopping, nothing does. I bought beautiful Murano hand-blown glass , a Venetian porcelain mask after trying on over 30, and as usual, spent my entire food budget on gelato. Check out my 10 travel tips for Venice at the bottom of this post! Regardless of my tired eyes, I couldn’t miss the beauty right in front of me, like Doge’s Palace and the Bridge of Sighs. Venice is quite easy to walk around and before you know it you’ve seen quite a lot, by accident! Couples holding each other as the gondola floated through the canals, decadent old buildings in San Marco square, and even a few marriage proposals! This is the place to go to with someone you love.  There are so many hidden corners of Venice to explore. Venice was full of tourists just like us, and sadly we never met any Italians there. Because sightseeing wasn’t on our list, we did what any normal, bored, sad to not have boyfriends, girls would do: sat by the canals, got drunk, and waited on a boat to drive us around. Hitchhiking Venice The boat that came was a paramedic boat. The 3 men spoke no English. We brought our 2 bottles of wine on board and took off into the open water, past Murano Island. We drank and laughed because no one knew what was going on due to the language barrier. That was until they got a call… an emergency call. We were quickly dropped off, definitely not where we started… and were a bit too drunk to find our way. When traveling I cannot let being lost damper my mood or I’d be annoyed every day. Headed to Rehab We decided to take a nudie swim and trespassed across someone’s lawn to what looked like fresh clean water. It was out by the sea, not the canals. We went for a swim and then realized we had some peeping eyes. We couldn’t stay in the water forever so we got out, the men offered us an outdoor shower and towels. We were invited to dinner. Being on a budget, we stayed, even though the guys were oddballs, and had some veggies by the campfire. Eventually I started to sober up, and I questioned why are these 20 men having dinner at a campfire together… all living in this house? When we couldn’t come up with a plausible answer we decided it was best to leave. On our way out we saw the sign: “Men’s Rehabilitation Center”. Just one look at the cotton-candy sunset made me forget what nonsense the day was, and we were off for more gelato. 10 Tips for Venice: 1. Only get a tourist water transit pass to save money on rides if you want to ride on the Grand Canal very often. It probably won’t be necessary as most attractions are in the main square. 2. Be prepared that everything costs money &amp; it’s VERY crowded, check out the sights in the morning! Sit by the edge and stare out at the teal water 3. A cafe near a tourist location will charge you maybe up to 5 times the cost of the drink you order,  if you sit down . They can call it either a service fee or a “listening to the band” fee. 4. St. Marks Basilica, like all the great ones in Italy, has a very long line 5. Be prepared to have a difficult time finding budget accommodation like hostels. We ended up in a hotel for about 40 a night which was well over our budget 6. Taking a map probably won’t help. It seemed like everyone was a little lost, all the time. Just ask for directions, but remember most people are tourists just like you. Target shopkeepers! If you are on a tight time frame, take a tour! Sometimes hearing a local tell you the history of a building can make sightseeing 10x more fun. For all the things to do here, check out a walking tour of Venice to make it a little easier. 7. Like most major cities, you can get a museum pass. As always, only get a pass like this is you want to visit all the museums. You can even do a hop on hop on tour of Venice . 8. Because there are far more tourists in Venice than locals, you will have to look really hard to find quality local food. Most restaurants we went to were pretty crap and really over priced. If you have a kitchen at hotel, try to make a few meals at home, not only will it save money but it might taste better! 9. Take a trip to Murano to see the hand blown glass. Some boats will take you for free hoping you buy something, but be sure they don’t say you “have” to buy something 10. Don’t stay in Venice too long… Check out my tips for visiting the Vatican City in Rome."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-rome/,italy,"Luxury Guide to Rome Welcome to Backpacker’s Boutique.

After I finished my degree in English Literature at Oxford I decided to follow my dream of moving to Rome and writing novels. I’d been to Rome several times as a tourist, but during an internship at Keats-Shelley House I fell in love with the city, and was determined to come back for good. Over the past two and a half years I’ve got to know Rome really well, exploring the streets and visiting the best bars and restaurants, and my work with Through Eternity Tours has led me to discover another side of the city. My “expertise” isn’t limited to where to go shopping, or where to get the best gelato – I’ve also got an endless supply of random trivia about Rome. For example, did you know that there’s an elephant buried under the Vatican? Or that there’s an Ancient Roman fire station in Trastevere? What makes Rome a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? This is the city of La Dolce Vita – Rome is always glamorous! Well, not so much the area around Termini (the main train station), but everywhere else…The city centre is so breathtakingly beautiful, from the piazzas to the hills. You’ll find Roman history and Renaissance art on every corner, along with some of the best designer shops and most luxurious hotels and restaurants. What 5 star hotel is the best in Rome? I’ve never personally stayed in any, having only experienced a cheap hostel as a student, and then my apartment in Testaccio, but there are lots of excellent five star hotels in Rome. The St Regis is one of the grandest, and the Cavalieri is famously luxurious, with the only three star Michelin restaurant in Rome. What about boutique hotels in Rome, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? I’ve heard good things about Babuino 181 , a boutique hotel located near the Spanish Steps, and the Kolbe Hotel looks lovely – it’s in a fifteenth century palazzo (and former convent), right near the Roman Forum. If you’re on a tighter budget but want comfort and a bit of peace and quiet after a long day of sightseeing, I’d recommend the Beehive Hostel. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? It depends on your definition of “adventurous”, but exploring the ruins of Rome always feels like an adventure to me. Many of my most memorable days in Rome have been spent cycling down the Appian Way, a Roman road that used to go all the way to Brindisi. It’s such an atmospheric place, surrounded by catacombs, statues and the ruins of Roman villas. I also recommend visiting the Domus Aurea – the remains of Nero’s pleasure palace. It’s not always open to the public, but if you’re lucky enough to go on a tour, you’ll be given a hard hat and taken into the dark hallways of the most haunting place in Rome. If you’re looking for a meal to remember, have dinner with a local through BonAppetour. You can even dine on the terrace from Roman Holiday ! Where are the best hang outs during the day? The Villa Borghese is a huge, shady park full of umbrella pines and peaceful places to sit with a book. Visit the Galleria Borghese – an incredible art gallery with masterpieces by Bernini and Raphael – and then relax in the park. In the summer, escape the heat of the city and go to the beach for the day – Santa Marinella or Sperlonga. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Rome and what are their best dishes? My neighbourhood, Testaccio, is home to many of the best restaurants in Rome, including Da Felice, Da Bucatino, and Flavio Al Velavevodetto. My ideal meal – cacio e pepe (a traditional Roman pasta dish made with pecorino cheese and black pepper), cicoria ripassata or puntarelle (two very distinctive chicory salads) and tiramisu. And wine, of course! Another personal favourite is Osteria al 16 in Monti. The pasta section of the menu is never-ending, and everything I’ve eaten there has been delicious. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? For tiramisu, Pompi wins hands-down. The main branch is near Re di Roma, but there’s also a small takeaway branch near Piazza di Spagna. Their traditional tiramisu is excellent, but the strawberry or pistachio versions are also worth a try. The best gelato in Rome is definitely a question of personal taste, but I think the best is Fassi, a gelateria which used to serve Hitler and Mussolini. The gelato is creamy and delicious, and portions are generous. I also love my local gelateria, Panna &amp; Co, which only uses natural, seasonal ingredients. Try the mango and ginger. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Monti is the place to go. This lively neighbourhood is only a five minute walk from the Colosseum, but it’s refreshingly un-touristy, and there are lots of cool clothes shops. You’ll find boutiques run by up-and-coming designers, as well as a good selection of vintage shops. Visit at the weekend and check out Mercato Monti, which has lots of stalls run by young local designers. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Rome? There’s a hammam tucked away in the Jewish Ghetto. After soaking in the pool at Acquamadre you can have a massage or a facial. For an even more luxurious experience, try one of the hotel spas, such as the Hotel de Russie. If you want a haircut and you’re nervous about something getting lost in translation – I know I was, when I visited an Italian hairdresser’s for the first time – visit Noi. The staff at this smart salon in Piazza del Popolo speak English. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? You’ll get a spectacular sunset from any of Rome’s seven hills, so it’s hard to choose. A personal favourite is the view from the Giardino degli Aranci on the Aventine Hill. It’s particularly romantic at dusk, and you have a stunning view of St Peter’s. The view of the Forum from the Capitoline Hill or the Palatine Hill is also unbeatable. Gazing at the ruins of the Ancient Rome, listening to the swallows as the sun sets…there’s nowhere else I’d rather be. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Trastevere is a beautiful neighbourhood with a great choice of bars. It’s getting a bit too touristy, but there are some lovely places in the side streets, like my favourite bar Chakra. It always feels really relaxed and cosy, and they play great music from the 70s and 80s Overall I prefer Monti, which has a healthier local to tourist ratio. The piazza is always really lively at night, with lots of young Italians drinking on the steps of the fountain. I enjoy having an Aperol spritz in the café in the piazza, but in Monti you’re really spoilt for choice. It’s one of the few places in the centre of Rome where you’re bound to find something new every time you visit, and there are still so many places on my “to try” list, such as the cocktail bar Suburra 1930. If you want to well and truly escape the tourist trail, take the tram to Pigneto. Compared to the centro storico it feels like another world, and it reminds me a bit of Camden in London, but sometimes it’s nice to see another side of Rome. It’s cheaper too. For more practical tips on Rome, check out this post . If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? I’m really not into clubbing, which is a shame, given that I live so close to some of the most famous clubs in Rome! There are lots of clubs huddled around the base of Monte Testaccio, an artificial hill formed of broken Roman pottery. L’Alibi is a popular gay club. Try Caruso Café for samba, or Akab for electronic and dance."https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,italy,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,italy,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2018/03/best-restaurants-in-osaka/,japan,"WHERE TO EAT CHEAP IN OSAKA My most recent trip to Osaka was my fourth time in the city. But I still vividly remember the first. Osaka was the first destination in Japan that we set foot in. We were travel newbies back then: lacking in knowledge, wisdom, and confidence. Every single day of that trip, we spent a loooong time deciding where to eat because we were so intimidated by everything.       We were on a super tight budget that if we overspent on something, we would risk giving up another activity. There was this restaurant near the train station that we both wanted to try, but there was no menu outside. Every time we passed by, we stopped and stood in front of it, discussing whether or not we should go in. We were so afraid we won’t be able to afford it that we ended up eating at a convenience store each time. (We were able to try only 3 restaurants on that trip, but they were all originally part of our itinerary.) Of course, after several Japan trips, we know better. We now know that there are a lot of cheap but wonderful food spots in every city, and we have gathered enough confidence (and money) to find and try them. I guess that’s why I like visiting cities over and over again. When the streets and lights bombard you with old memories, you’re reminded that after each journey, people, like places, are never the same. This trip is different because this time, it was all about the food. We sought out the restaurants and stalls that could give us cheap but unforgettable eats. And here’s what we found. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Endo Sushi Tokisushi Ramen Yashichi Okonomiyaki Kiji Aizuya Takoyaki Kuromon Ichiba Market Bonus: Supermarkets Where to Book Cheap Flights to Osaka Search for cheap flights here Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Endo Sushi What to try : Sushi Set 1 Price : ¥1150 + 8% tax I eat at Endo Sushi every time I’m in the city. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. That should tell you how much I enjoy this small and unassuming sushi shop. That, despite being located far from the city’s many popular tourist spots. It is almost an attraction in itself with tourists going out of their way to have their own plateful. Endo Sushi has been serving what many consider “Osaka’s best” for over a century. Yep, more than 100 years, and they’re here to stay, despite being so small. The place has only five tables and a short bar, so expect to queue up a bit. Immediately upon taking a seat, you wull be served a cup of hot green tea together with a hot towelette. On the table are two small porcelain bowls that cradle shoyu (soy sauce) and pickled ginger. Don’t go looking for wasabi because it’s already mixed with rice. Aside from the toppings, this wasabi mixture sets Endo apart from other sushi places. It’s a perfect blend of saltiness and spice. If you’re not a fan, tell the chef or waiter upon ordering so they can create wasabi-less pieces for you. Endo’s menu has only a few choices. You get to pick among four sets only, each priced at ¥1150 + 8% tax. Every set is made up of five pre-selected pieces (omakase), but you can have a piece replaced if you like. I have tried all four sets, and Set 1 — composed of anago (sea water eel), uni (sea urchin), tai (sea bream), toro (fatty tuna), and hamachi (yellowtail) — is, by a mile, the best. Many of these pieces have premium toppings including toro and uni. If you want to try the other plates, don’t be shy to order more. It’s perfectly normal to have a rack of multiple plates because every piece is glorious. Because it’s located just next to the fish market, they get first dibs on the freshest ingredients, and you can taste the freshness with every bite. Operating hours : Monday-Saturday, 5am – 2pm (closed on Sunday and Holidays) How to get there : The closest stations are Noda and Tamagawa. They’re very close to each other so just take whatever is more convenient. From Noda Station, cross the street and turn left until you hit an intersection. Turn right and walk along that road until you see Aji River. Turn right onto the road just before the bridge. The big building to your right is Osaka Fish Market. Walk towards the market and keep left — Don’t climb the overpass — and you’ll see Endo Sushi after the parking lot. Tokisushi What to try : 12-piece Assorted Sushi Set Price : ¥1050 + tax If ¥1150 can treat you to 5 pieces at Endo Sushi, an even smaller amount, ¥1050, can give you a dozen at Tokisushi (Toki Sushi). Toki Sushi. Photo by Vins Carlos We love Toki Sushi for two things. First, its location. If you’re staying around Namba, then this should be within walking distance of your hotel. The other, its affordability. A standard plate here, with 2 pieces of nigiri sushi, costs only ¥150. A more premium sushi — like fatty tuna and sea urchin — are at ¥150 apiece. But most diners get their assorted sushi plates, which cost ¥730 for 8 pieces and ¥1050 for a dozen. We ordered the dozen-platter. The waitress served a wooden board that looked almost overflowing with sushi, all twelve of them topped with big cuts of seafood. However, most are crowned with regular toppings like squid, tamago, and regular tuna. If you have more dough to burn, we highly encourage you to try their premium sushi set (¥2100), which will give you all the awesome pieces like uni, Japanese eel, and fatty tuna. I would choose Endo Sushi over Tokisushi any day, but that’s expected because the former is way pricier. But I still encourage you to try both. If you do, however, try Tokisushi first so you won’t be underwhelmed. Operating hours : 11am – 11pm How to get there : The closest stations are Namba and Nippombashi. Ramen Yashichi What to try : Shoyu Ramen Price : ¥730 Like most best-kept secrets in Japan, Ramen Yashichi is housed in a humble, compact, dingy hole in a wall that is easy to walk past. We almost did, since there was no queue outside it, pretty unusual for a ramen place that is supposedly one of the best in Osaka. But there is a perfect, sensible explanation for it. As soon as we started queueing, we were approached by one of the staff, who gave us a number with a small message telling us to come back at the specified time. That’s their way of avoiding creating a long line in front of the shop (perhaps because it could block the entrance to its neighboring stores). But it was mid-afternoon of a weekday so we didn’t get to wait much. In 10 minutes, we were inside, trying to figure out the all-Japanese vending machine that takes customers orders. The staff, though, was gracious enough to assist us. In no time, we were seated at one of the only two tables and served a big bowl of ramen. There are three main types of ramen here: shoyu (soy sauce), shio (salt), and tsukemen (noodles are served separately for dipping). Online consensus highly favors shoyu so both Vins and I ordered the same thing. Cost: . Shoyu: ¥730 Shio: ¥780 Tsukemen: ¥880 Ramen Yashichi. Photo by Vins Carlos This was the first time I stuffed my body with a ramen in a chicken-based broth. I’m used to pork bone (tonkotsu) and have tried beef bone (gyukotsu) before, but this one was different. I was afraid I’d be disappointed because I assumed that, since it is chicken-based, it would taste light. I like my soup like I like my men, rich and strong. However, it was anything but light. It was heavy, almost like tonkotsu, but creamy. Think of it as the lovechild of a tonkotsu ramen and a chicken macaroni soup. It’s one of those broths that get more flavorful with every spoonful, complementing the sweet marinade of the chashu toppings. Before I knew it, my bowl was empty. Operating Hours : Monday-Friday 10:45am-4pm (Closed: Saturday, Sunday) How to get there : Closest train station is Nakatsu. Ramen Yashichi is only 3 blocks from there. Okonomiyaki Kiji What to try : Okonomiyaki Price : ¥850 We had just finished checking out the view from Umeda Sky Building’s observatory, when our grumbling tummies and a quick Google search led us to the door of Okonomiyaki Kiji, at the tower’s basement food court called Takimi Koji. We were greeted by the staff, who gladly ushered us in. Spotting our cameras, he asked if we wanted to sit by the bar (perhaps so we could get better angles). We were there for okonomiyaki, but he highly recommended the yakisoba. We ended up with both. The chef began creating the dish in front of us. The more they took form, the more we realized that these would be HUGE pieces, maybe bigger than we can handle. When it was all done, he split both the okonomiyaki and yakisoba in two, and evenly distributed the pieces. Okonomiyaki is Osaka’s famous traditional pancake usually made of wheat flour, cabbage, and eggs. Kiji allows you to choose the protein components of the dish, so we opted for a mixture of everything: bacon, beef, squid. The last piece was a shiso, a perilla leaf. (I’m not a fan of perilla, but Vins is.) Kiji’s was everything you could hope for in an okonomiyaki: big, filling, flavorful, and well-seasoned. And because our order sat on the grill the entire time, it remained warm throughout the meal. Cost: ¥850 . But that yakisoba totally upstaged the okonomiyaki. The yakisoba had a soft, juicy but non-soggy texture that was punctuated by the squid, meat and veggie bits. Operating Hours : Friday-Wednesday 11:30am-9pm (Closed: Thursdays) How to get there : Closest train stations are Osaka and Umeda. Aizuya Takoyaki What to try : Takoyaki Set Price : ¥500 Aizuya is widely believed to be the birthplace of takoyaki, Osaka’s most popular street food. Yep, they are credited for inventing takoyaki. Their takoyaki is served without any sauce, which shows just how confident they are with the taste of their product. And it must be pretty darn awesome because they got a recommendation from Michelin’s Bib Gourmand 2016 Guide. All these made us visit. Unfortunately, it was still closed when we arrived and we didn’t have the luxury of time. Boohoo. Anyway, if you want to try it, a 12-piece plate is only ¥500, 15-piece ¥620. Aizuya has a few branches including one in Umeda and another in Namba. Kuromon Ichiba Market For over 190 years, Kuromon Market has been known as Osaka’s kitchen for its almost endless array of gastronomic options, ranging from rare fruits to mouth-watering seafoods that you can eat or have prepared on the spot. We stumbled upon it by accident. We didn’t realize that the shop where we would be picking up our Amazing Osaka Pass is located here, so we were delightfully, unexpectedly bombarded by sensory treats. The scent of grilled food and the greetings from sellers filled the air. Although not part of the plan, we ended up digging into some of the delicacies sold here including seared scallops and sweet potatoes. Compared to other markets I have visited in Japan, Kuromon is actually a bit pricier, but the experience make up for it. They sell items in small servings, which allows visitors to get a taste of a wide variety of products, something that a regular restaurant can’t give you. There’s just so much to see and taste here. If you want to try Kobe beef but not flush enough to afford a proper cut, you can get hold of small slices here. Even the deadly fugu (pufferfish) is sold in one of the corners. Open : Daily, 9am-6pm How to get there : Closest stations are Nippombashi and Namba Bonus: Supermarkets If you’re traveling on a shoestring, a good way to save on food is by shopping at a friendly neighborhood supermarket. I do it all the time when I’m staying in Japan for a long time. Supermarkets in Japan sell fresh and cooked food, and they are goooooood. Not as good as what you would have at a proper restaurant, but waaaay better than what you would expect from supermarkets. Tip : Shop for food past 8pm because most perishable products (like sushi and other cooked meals) are put on sale!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2018/03/what-to-do-in-osaka/,japan,"OSAKA ON A BUDGET 2018: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary We were about the approach the platform when we noticed a woman running after us. At first, we didn’t think it was us she was chasing, but she stopped and motioned that we follow her. She couldn’t speak English, but we recognized just one word — ticket — as she pointed in the direction of the gates.       We were at Kansai Airport Train Station, and it was our first time in Japan. As newbies in this country, we foolishly thought we would just feed our ticket to the machines at the gate and that was it. We didn’t think that the machine would spit it our on the other end and that we were supposed to pick it up. The woman chasing us apparently saw our mistake so she ran after us and tried to get our attention. She then led us to the staff at the gate and explained to them what happened in Japanese. The machine had already eaten our tickets so they fished them out and returned them to us. We thanked the woman profusely, who responded with, “It’s okay.” Her smile never faded. Barely an hour in Japan and we already witnessed firsthand the hospitality and helpfulness of the people of Kansai. It wasn’t the last time. In the four times we have visited the city over the past few years, we have met locals who would go out of their way to help: a shopkeeper who left her store to accompany us to the start of a walking trail, a food vendor who brought us to the bus stop, a passerby who helped when he saw I couldn’t understand the writings on a vendo. Osaka doesn’t have the breathtaking landscapes and spectacular sights that other destinations in Japan are known for, but it has the warmth and kindness of its people. And that’s always something to return to. That and the food. Oh yes, the food. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts What You Need to Know Osaka is the third largest city in Japan in terms of population, next only to Tokyo and Yokohama. But because Yokohama is part of the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, Osaka is widely regarded as Japan’s “second city.” It is the capital of Osaka Prefecture which — together with Kyoto, Nara, Hyogo (Kobe) and a few others — is part of Kansai Region. This post is co-presented by Cebu Pacific Air. Osaka is considered the culinary capital of Japan, boasting several signature dishes including okonomiyaki and takoyaki. Because of its location, its food and culture in general have influences from adjacent prefectures. Shabu-shabu, for example, is always attributed with the city but actually originated in Tottori. Kobe beef is also available at countless restaurants in Osaka, but the beef is supplied by its neighbor. It’s also one of biggest port cities, ensuring a steady supply of ocean bounty and products from other parts of the country. Osaka also has something to offer to almost any type of traveler. For tourists seeking family-friendly fun, one of the most popular attractions is Universal Studios Japan, which is one of the most visited theme parks in the world. Historic and cultural landmarks also dot its tourism map, including the enormous Osaka Castle and Shitennoji. For the shopaholic, there’s always the Dotonbori-Shinsaibashi area. Osaka is also a great base if you want to explore other parts of Kansai Region. From here, you can easily travel to other cities within the region including Kyoto, Kobe, and Nara. If you want to go farther, you’ll find plenty of transportation options that can take you to Himeji, Hiroshima, and Tottori. There are also buses that can connect you straight to Tokyo. Other info you need to know: Language: Japanese (Nihongo). The majority of the locals seldom speak English, but most of the signs and other tourist promotional materials have English translations. Currency: Japanese Yen (JPY, ¥). JPY 1000 is around USD 9.36, EUR 7.60, PHP 484 (as of February 2018). Money Exchange. There are a lot of money changers throughout Osaka and Kyoto, but save yourself the trouble and just exchange currencies before your trip. SANRY’S has good rates. You can also withdraw from ATMs when you’re there, but they’re pretty hard to find. Most of the ATMs we saw didn’t accept international cards. Modes of payment: Most establishments prefer cash payment, but many of them also accept credit card transactions. Electricity Info : 100V. Type A sockets. Plugs have two flat pins. Type B is sometimes used but not that common. Best Time to Visit When is the best time to visit Osaka? Early April for the cherry blossoms and mid to late November for the autumn foliage. Kansai enjoys a temperate climate with strong seasonal variations. Spring and autumn are perfect if you’re after fantastic views. During spring (specifically last week of March to first week of April), cherry blossoms adorn the otherwise plain green canopies. Autumn (specifically mid- to late November) is ideal because the crowd begins to thin and the prices drop. It’s also interesting as the foliage turns fiery orange and red. Temperature is also pleasant and comfortable for sightseeing. If budget is a concern, look away from peak season: late March to August, especially the following dates: Golden Week (April 29 – May 5) Obon Festival (August 13–15) Cherry Blossoms Season (Late March-Early April) These dates bring the biggest crowds and steepest prices. How to Get a Japan Visa If you’re from the Philippines, we created three dedicated posts for the visa application process. How to Apply for TOURIST Japan Visa How to Apply for a Visa for VISITING FRIENDS or RELATIVES How to Apply for a MULTIPLE Entry Japan Visa Japan Visa Frequently Asked Questions How to Get to Osaka Kansai International Airport (KIX) is the primary gateway to Osaka and the rest of Kansai Region. A lot of airlines fly from Manila to Kansai Airport. If you book way in advance, you’ll get the best deals from Cebu Pacific Air. CEB flies to Osaka five times a week. Their lowest year-round fare is at P6399, which is a great deal already. You can also wait for a SEAT SALE! For one of our trips, I was able to score a roundtrip Cebu Pacific ticket from their P20 SALE. The base fare per leg was only P20, but including all the taxes, I only paid PHP 5984 for the roundtrip ticket (PHP 2992 per way). That includes a prepaid baggage allowance of 20 Kg. Not bad. Not bad at all. Search for cheap flights here .  Where to Stay in Osaka I highly recommend staying in the Namba area because it’s in a central, most convenient and most accessible location. Staying in Namba means Dotonbori and Shinsaibashi are within walking distance. There are also direct trains from the airport, which means you won’t be transferring multiple times with heavy luggage in tow. The area is also bursting with restaurants, food stalls, markets, shops, and convenience stores. When you stay in Namba, you’re at the very center of all the action.

Check Rates &amp; Availability .   How to Get from Kansai Airport to Namba Kansai Airport is almost an hour from downtown Osaka, so make sure you take that into consideration when building your itinerary. Fortunately, there are plenty of transportation options that you can take to reach the city center. But where in the city center? By Train There are two railway operators ferrying passengers from the airport: JR and Nankai. But it is only Nankai that goes straight to Namba. You can take JR too, but it will involve a transfer. Nankai is what we usually take. The train terminals are on the second floor of the building next to the Arrival Hall. Just take the escalator and use the bridge to get to the other side. There are two main types of Nankai trains running from the airport: NANKAI AIRPORT EXPRESS This is the regular train. It looks like your regular subway train. It is cheaper but slower. You can’t reserve seats on this train. Just hop in and find a spot.Travel time : 45 minutesFare : 920 NANKAI LIMITED EXPRESS RAPI:T (Rapit) This is the premier train. It’s the deep blue train that looks like it came from the future. LOL. It’s a little bit faster than the Airport Express, but much more comfortable. If you want to make sure you’re seated comfortably throughout the journey, book this train.Travel time : 38 minutesFare : ¥920 + ¥510 seat fee If you decide to go with the Limited Express Rapi:t, you can reserve a seat via Klook. Here’s how to use it: Book a ticket with Klook. Reserve a ticket here When the transaction is complete, you will be emailed a mobile voucher. You can print it out or save it on your phone. On the day of your trip, upon arrival at Kansai Airport, find the HIS Counter at the Arrival Hall. There is usually a small KLOOK logo displayed in front of the counter. Show your mobile voucher to the staff. You will be given a physical voucher. Proceed to the Train Station (in the other building), find the Nankai Ticketing Counter, and exchange your voucher with the actual train ticket. Do it at least 30 minutes before your schedule. Enter the Nankai train station using the ticket. RESERVE A TICKET HERE By Bus You can also take the bus to Osaka City Air Terminal (OCAT), which is located in the Namba area. Note that the first bus leaves Terminal 1 at 6:10am, last train at 10:40pm. Travel time is about 1 hour, but varies depending on the traffic conditions. At the Arrival Hall, approach the counter for AIRPORT BUS to OCAT. Purchase a ticket to OCAT. Fare: ¥1050. They will need your passport so make sure you have it ready. You will be given both the ticket (white) and a receipt (green). Proceed to Departure Platform 11 (or whatever platform number you’re told). Wait for the bus at the platform. If you have big bags, the staff will take them and tag them. You will be given a slip that you’ll need to claim your bags upon arrival at OCAT so don’t lose them. Board the bus when it arrives. The driver will check your ticket. Find your seat number and get comfy. The travel time is around 1 hour, depending on traffic. Alight at OCAT. That’s it! You’re at OCAT. From here you can walk to your hotel. Internet Connection in Osaka Pocket Wifi Rental You will find wi-fi rental booths at the Arrival Area of Kansai Airport. Rates are usually between JPY 800-900 per day. However, they are very in demand so there might not be any more available if you arrive in the late afternoon or evening. Some establishments accept only credit card transactions. If you really want to make sure you get a mobile wifi, you can reserve one in advance via Klook for only PhP 389 per day for unlimited 4G access. That’s a lot cheaper than those you will find at Kansai airport. The best part, if you’re a group, you can connect multiple devices hassle-free. You can then split the cost with your friends. You can pick up the device at the airport. No deposit is required . RESERVE THIS NOW Local SIM If you opt with a 4G Data SIM, you can choose between two packages: unlimited 4G data for 8 days (around ¥3360) and 3GB data for 8 days (around ¥2160). If you’re a heavy data user, best to go with the Unlimited Plan. You can pick up the SIM card at Kansai Airport. RESERVE A LOCAL SIM NOW How to Get Around Osaka The easiest way to get around Osaka is by train or subway. Osaka is linked to the rest of the island by an expensive (and expensive) train system. In theory, traveling around is easy and hassle-free. In practice, however, it is difficult. Besides the language barrier, these train lines are as complicated and challenging as your previous relationship. You might think you’re on the right side of the right platform at the right station, but there’s still a chance that you board the wrong train and in some cases the wrong car. Some trains even split into half at one point, and they choo choo in separate directions. But thank heavens for the Internet. So here’s a tip. If you own a smartphone or a tablet, do yourself a favor and get connected to the Internet! You will need access to Hyperdia , a web-based search engine that would tell you train schedules and routes instantly. Just make sure you know the closest train station to your destination and let Hyperdia do the rest. Here’s more info : How to Use Hyperdia If you want to score some savings, you can use any of the train passes available. Just pick one that best matches your itinerary. The two passes that you will most likely use are Osaka Amazing Pass and JR West Kansai Rail Pass: Osaka Amazing Pass I strongly recommend this! The ultimate all-inclusive Osaka sightseeing pass, available in 1-day and 2-day versions! It gives the holder unlimited use of the subway, tramway, and bus systems in Osaka. It also gives FREE access to certain attractions including the following: Osaka Castle Main Tower Umeda Building’s Floating Garden Observatory HEP FIVE Ferris Wheel Natural Hot Spring Naniwa no Yu Tombori River Cruise Dotombori Tour You can reserve one via Klook. However, know that there are two types on Klook, depending on where you wish to pick it up. Make sure you book the one that is more convenient for you. If you want to pick up the pass at Kansai Airport, RESERVE HERE . If you want to pick it up at Kuromon Market in Namba, RESERVE HERE . JR West Kansai Rail Pass This pass offers unlimited rail and bus rides to and in many cities in Kansai Region including Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and Nara. You can also use this to travel from Kansai Airport to Osaka and back. Available in 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-day validity variants. Note that this pass is only accepted on JR Trains. This won’t work on Nankai lines or subway lines. Do you need this pass? If you plan on staying within Osaka and not visiting other cities, this is not for you. Get the Amazing Osaka Pass instead. If you plan to visit Kyoto, Nara, Kobe or other cities in Kansai, this could be great for you. IMPORTANT! You can’t buy this pass in Japan. You have to purchase ONLINE. This pass is meant for foreign nationals traveling as a temporary visitor (tourist) in Japan. Hence, you can’t buy this pass in Japan. Thankfully, there’s Klook. You can book below: 1-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE 2-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE 3-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE 4-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE How does it work? How do you use it? Oh, easy, easy. Book a ticket with Klook. When the transaction is complete, you will be emailed a mobile voucher. You can print it out or save it on your phone. On the day of your trip, upon arrival at Kansai Airport, find the HIS Counter at the Arrival Hall. There is usually a small KLOOK logo displayed in front of the counter. Show your mobile voucher to the staff. You will be given a physical voucher. You don’t have to use it immediately. The count will begin on the day you first use it. For example, if you purchase a 2-day pass and you claim it on Monday, it doesn’t mean that you have to use it on Monday and Tuesday. You may choose to use it any day before expiration. If you use it for the first time on Thursday, you can use it on that day and Friday. When you use it for the first time, approach the staff at the counter at any of the station and he will stamp the final date you may use the pass. For succeeding uses, simply show the stamp on the pass at the staff at every JR station. You can use it together with Osaka Amazing Pass too! On my last trip, I used an Osaka Amazing Pass when roaming within the city and then used my JR Kansai Pass on days when I traveled to Kyoto and Kobe. ICOCA Card The ICOCA Card isn’t a pass. It’s a prepaid IC card. It’s sort of Kansai’s version of Tokyo’s SUICA or PASMO Card. When you use an ICOCA card, you still pay for every trip. (Again, it’s NOT a pass.) You can also use it to snag some discounts, but the real convenience is that you don’t need to get a ticket each time you’re using the train. You just need to quickly hover the card over the reader and you’re through. It functions like an MRT stored-value ticket (because that’s exactly what it is, a stored-value ticket). You can also use it not just on trains but also on buses, lockers, vending machines, and even convenience stores. Yep, lockers. The ICOCA card works on lockers at train stations! To get one, you just need to approach one of the ICOCA machines at the station. There’s no use for me to enumerate the steps here because it’s so easy. Just choose ENGLISH on the welcome screen and follow the instructions. But if you want a discount, you can get an ICOCA card from Klook, which is already preloaded with ¥1500 + the deposit of ¥500. You can get the deposit when you return the card. RESERVE NOW JR Pass If you’re visiting Osaka, Nara and Kyoto ONLY, you don’t need a JR Pass . It’s only for those who will make multiple long-distance journeys. If you’re staying within the Kansai Region, get a JR KANSAI RAIL PASS INSTEAD. When is it wise to purchase a JR Pass? If you’re visiting multiple cities in Japan and you’re staying for at least 7 days. If your itinerary is more like that, purchase a pass before your trip. Klook offers the cheapest JR Passes available. If you live in the Philippines, the pass will be delivered to you in 7 days. IMPORTANT! The JR Pass is NOT available in Japan, so you have to purchase online! CHECK JR PASS RATES HERE Places to Visit in Osaka Universal Studios Japan Nearest Station: Universal City Station (JR Yumesaki/Sakurajima Line) As you already know, it’s a movie theme park that could bring a lot of fun to kids and adults alike. USJ is the first US branch in Asia, but it has been given a new life when they opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and Despicable Me Minion Mayhem . The problem with USJ is that it can get a bit too crowded especially on weekends. You can waste over an hour falling in line for just one attraction. If you want to get the most out of your time, an Express Pass is recommended. It costs extra, but it is worth it, in my experience. Express Passes sometimes sell out especially during peak season so it’s best to reserve online. Are there DISCOUNTED TICKETS? YES! Klook sells so-called 1.5 Day Pass . Basically, this pass will allow you to visit Universal Studios Japan at 3pm on Day 1 and then you can still use it for the entire day the following day. This gives you enough time to try more rides and enjoy more of the park. And guess what, it is even cheaper than 1-Day Passes! A standard 1-Day pass costs ¥7900 while Klook’s 1.5 Day Pass is only ¥7100. That’s much more value for a much lower price. The 1.5 Day Pass must be picked up at Kansai International Airport or Namba OCAT (Osaka City Air Terminal). WHERE TO BUY TICKETS Book online!

From Osaka, you can easily travel to Kyoto, Kobe, Nara, Himeji, and even as far as Tottori and Hiroshima. We created a separate post for that, with information on how to get there by taking public transportation. Read it here: PLACES TO VISIT NEAR OSAKA Organized Day Tours This section wasn’t in the original version of this guide because we often advocate DIY Travel, but we’ve been receiving a lot of inquiries from people who will be traveling with kids or seniors (parents). Here are some tours that Klook has tested and is offering.

You can find that here: OSAKA CHEAP RESTAURANTS . Sample Itinerary In a perfect world, I would exhaust all the 15 days I was allowed. But you know, this world has shortcomings, much like my wallet. Below is a sample 4-day 4-night itinerary which involves spending 2 nights in Osaka and another 2 nights in Kyoto. To better understand the Kyoto leg of this itinerary, read this first: KYOTO TRAVEL GUIDE . It assumes the following: You’re taking Cebu Pacific flight scheduled to arrive in Osaka at 8:10pm. IMPORTANT! In this case, make sure that the first thing you do after going through Immigration and picking up your bags is to head straight to the HIS Office to collect the passes and/or mobile wifi that you booked with Klook because it closes at 10pm. You have an Osaka Amazing Pass, from hereon shall be referred to as OA Pass (¥2397), to save some yen . Having the Osaka Amazing Pass will waive the entrance fees to some of the attractions and unlimited access to the subway. It costs ¥2397 if you book with Klook. RESERVE HERE You have an ICOCA card to make it easier for you to go through train gates and use lockers. RESERVE HERE You DON’T need a JR Pass or Kansai Pass for this itinerary . The OA Pass for the Osaka leg and ICOCA Card for Kyoto are enough. Using the JR Pass will cost much more. You’re staying in a capsule hotel in Namba, like Capsule Hotel ASTIL Dotonbori or Y’s Cabin Osaka Namba (¥3250 per night)for the Osaka leg, and at a dorm near Kyoto Station like K’s House (¥2500 per night) for the Kyoto leg. You’re skipping breakfast . It’s healthy (according to intermittent fasting advocates, hehe) and you’re poor! Make the necessary adjustments to match your schedule and preferences.

Universal Studios Japan eats up the biggest chunk of the budget. You can save a lot by skipping it, if it’s not your priority anyway. A fantastic alternative is Toei Studio Movie Park in Kyoto. This is my most-loved theme park in Japan because it’s uniquely Japanese. (More info about that here: Toei Kyoto Studio Park .) This way, the cost goes down to only ¥31,000 (USD 295, PHP15,300) Another way to further reduce the cost is by limiting your food budget to only ¥500 per lunch/dinner. Convenience stores and supermarkets offer cheap meals for much lower. But you’re in Japan! It would be such a shame to visit Osaka and not eat out! You can also find an early morning flight so you can save one hotel night. This itinerary may also be too dense for you. It was for me, haha. In fact, I skipped a few of these because my legs were this close to falling off. That’s because I’m old and lazy. Again, that’s me.   More Tips for the Poor Traveler Here are more tips to help make your trip go smoothly. Lockers . In major stations in Osaka and Kyoto, you’ll find them in many corners. There are two types: electronic and coin lockers. Electronic lockers require an ICOCA card to work, which will serve as the key. If you use your ICOCA card, don’t lose or return the card before you collect your bags. Coin lockers are better choices because you just need to take note of the locker number. Take a photo of your locker details and the surrounding shops so you could easily find them again. Locker rental costs ¥300-¥700 depending on the size. Lockers, again. In Kyoto, if your hotel is far from Kyoto Station (which is the focal point of everything touristy in the city) and your flight is scheduled at night, you may choose to store your baggage at one of the many lockers scattered at the lower levels of the station. This way, you save a hotel night and does not need to travel back to the hotel just to get your things. Tipping is unusual in Japan. Most restaurants have the cashier stationed by the exit so you pay after your meal, on your way out. When in doubt, ask . The people of Osaka and Kyoto are some of the friendliest I have ever met. When we were lost and asked for direction, they went out of their way to help us. Some even walked us to our destination. And when we expressed our gratitude, they would just smile at you as if it was nothing. They really were the nicest! "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2018/03/hida-takayama-japan/,japan,"TAKAYAMA ON A BUDGET 2018: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary Gifu Prefecture is fondly called the Heartland of Japan because of its location and, coincidentally, its shape. Right at its core is the city of Takayama. You could say that Takayama is the heart of the heart of Japan. And if that alone doesn’t strike a romantic chord in you, brace yourself. Takayama is quite the charmer. It does not woo. It does not beg for attention. It just stands there in the cold. Beating quietly. Staying unnoticed. But beware: when you give this heart a chance, it’s gonna steal yours just like that. I know. Takayama still has mine.         WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Hida-Takayama Because there are many other places in Japan called Takayama, many refer to Gifu’s Takayama as Hida-Takayama, in reference to the old Hida Province. Takayama lives up to its name “tall mountain”. Perched high above the mountains of Central Japan, it is enclosed and guarded by the Northern Alps. The isolation did the mountain city good as it established a unique fusion of culture molded and influenced by its very rich history. Takayama is one of the major cities in Gifu offering various transport services, making it an ideal transportation hub and the jump-off point to other nearby tourist attractions. The old merchant houses reflect the flourishing livelihood and economy of the city during the Edo Period under the Tokugawa shogunate rule. These longstanding traditional structures and architecture are reminiscent of Kyoto, prompting many to call the city “Little Kyoto”. The rich history and culture groomed Takayama to become one of the tourist destinations in Gifu, contributing largely to its economy, besides carpentry and agriculture. The city is also in the process of making the community senior-friendly and tourist-friendly with efforts such as building wheelchair-ready restrooms, installing benches, constructing bump-free roads, and improving communication materials and directional signs for tourists and visitors. Lastly, the city of Takayama had been awarded by the prestigious tour guidebook Michelin three-star rating twice for its old streets or Sanmachi and the biannual festivals with the traditional floats. (Reference: 2007 Michelin Voyager Pratique Japon; 2009 Michelin Green Guide Japon) Other information you need to know: Language: Japanese (Nihongo). The majority of the locals seldom speak English, but most of the signs and other tourist promotional materials have English translations. Currency: Japanese Yen (JPY, ¥). JPY 1000 is around USD 8.81, EUR 7.43, PHP 443 (as of December 2017). Modes of payment: Most establishments prefer cash payment, but many of them also accept credit card transactions. Electricity Info: 100V. Plugs have two flat pins.   How to Get to Hida-Takayama The nearest international airport is the Toyama Airport, but there are no direct flights from Manila to Toyama.

Reserve Your Slots Here   What to Eat in Hida-Takayama What we also love about Takayama is the convenience it provides tourists which stems from the well-thought-out layout of the city. It made touring the city an easy-breezy experience. The city’s strength is its accessibility. Tourist attractions, restaurants, shops, and accommodations are scattered around the city. You can find some of Takayama’s gastronomic gems within the city center. Ready? Here are Takayama’s must-try products. Hida Beef . Japan has excellent high-grade varieties of beef; one of those is the Hida Beef (Hida-gyu). It wouldn’t hurt splurging a little bit on your food for that pinkish, beautifully-marbled top-grade Hida beef, would it? Kihachiro Hida Beef Bun . Walking around Sanmachi led me to one of the most popular beef buns in Takayama. I got curious as I approach this small shop with people queuing for a beef bun, so I tried it. I got the bestseller, Premium Hida Beef Bun, for ¥500. Best food purchase! Sake . Takayama has been brewing sake for over four centuries already. Out of the numerous sake breweries, six have withstood the test of time and excelled. These six produce their own specialty products, each with its unique taste and trademark. These six sake breweries are Harada, Kawashiri, Niki, Hirase, Funasaka, and Hirata. Have a sample taste of their specialty products. Word of caution: you might purchase one after sampling it. 😉 Hoba Miso . One of my favorite Takayama local specialties is the Hoba miso. Aside from its unique presentation during meals, the miso paste cooked with other ingredients on Hoba leaf or Magnolia leaf is a gift to my palate. Takayama Ramen . The locals love their ramen, and the numerous ramen restaurants around Takayama is proof of that. Two characteristics of Takayama ramen are its curly noodles and its soy sauce-based soup.   Sample Itinerary Here’s a sample 6-day 5-night itinerary that covers Nagoya, Takayama, and Shirakawa-go.

Connectivity in some areas, however, may not be as good as the others. To access the free Wi-Fi, just select “Free Wi-Fi Takayama” and answer the questionnaire. Your ID and password will be sent to your email address. Log in using the ID and the password. Takayama Tourist Information Office . It is located outside Takayama train station. They communicate well in English and they can provide materials about the tourist attractions and activities in Takayama. These materials are also available in English. Be mindful of others . Don’t take too much time posing for photos to give others a chance to enjoy the views and attractions also. It is okay to get excited and be carried away, but don’t be too loud or rowdy. Be polite . Try to learn simple Japanese phrases. If you are using Nihongo to say thank you, don’t just say arigatou , but rather arigatou gozaimasu . The latter is more formal and polite. Sumimasen can mean excuse me or sorry."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/05/nagoya-japan-travel-guide/,japan,"NAGOYA ON A BUDGET 2018: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary If it isn’t too obvious yet, Japan is The Poor Traveler ‘s most-loved destination. Between Yoshke and myself, we have been to the Land of the Rising Sun a total of 14 times over the past 4 years. Sometimes, it can be easy for us to think that we’ve experienced the best that Japan has to offer, but every once in a while, we get slapped hard by a giant something that reads: “You ain’t seen nothing yet.” And just recently, that something was Nagoya.       This post is brought to you by JetStar. When somebody mentions Japan, the first cities that come to mind are Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. Nagoya, more often that not, is an afterthought. I had considered traveling to Nagoya many times before, but then I would see the cost of shinkansen or the time it takes to travel by bus and the plan of going to Nagoya would remain just that — a plan. But here’s the thing, Nagoya and its surrounding regions are more than just a side trip destination. It is home to some of the best sights in Japan! The best part, for those who do not have that much time or budget, Nagoya is becoming more and more affordable and accessible. Nagoya is the largest city in the Chubu Region and the capital of Aichi Prefecture. With over 2 million residents, it is also the fourth most populated city in Japan.

Important Reminders Related Posts Best Time to Visit Nagoya Japan in general is tourist-friendly year-round. Each season has its own charms, but spring and autumn are arguably the best and are my favorites. I’ve spent most of my life in the tropics so summer is not doing it for me anymore, and winter just doesn’t fit my sunny disposition in life. Whut. Hahaha. Word vomit. Spring (March-May) has great weather and the city turns into a giant garden, with the streets lined with flowers of different colors. The Nabana no Sato (Winter Illumination) remains lit until the end of May, so you can still get to experience these famous lights without the extreme cold. Fall (September-November) is also pleasant weather-wise. And just like spring, it transforms the city into a life-size painting as the foliage turns orange and bright red. Perfect for #OOTDs and totally Insta-worthy.   How to Get to Nagoya By Plane The Chūbu Centrair International Airport is the primary gateway to Nagoya and the rest of Central Japan.

Flight time is 5 hours and 10 minutes.   By Train Taking the shinkansen bullet train to Nagoya from other major cities outside Nagoya like Tokyo take you 2 hours and half via Shinkansen. That’s why I highly recommend that you don’t take the train unless you have JR Pass or if you’re on a Japan multi-city tour. From Tokyo . If you’re coming from Ueno Station, take the JR Keihintohoku line (¥200, P90) to Shinagawa station.

Sadly, the castle’s current main keep will undergo restoration this year. It will be open to the public until November 2017. There’s also an ongoing construction beside the castle, but no need to worry. It does not greatly affect or obstruct the beauty of the main castle. Osu Kannon Temple . This Kamakura-period Buddhist temple is located in Central Nagoya and is next to Osu Shopping Arcade. Shike-michi District . For Tokugawa period feels. Old houses and old cellars remain intact.

You’ll find traditional fgassho-zukuri farmhouses, some of which are over 250 years old. The roofing style of these houses are called “praying hands”. Shirakawa-gō Village Although the village is also great in spring and autumn, it is most magical in winter. The snow crowning the farmhouses and the night lights make it look like it’s straight from a hallmark card. But if you’re in Nagoya or in the village on the month of October, don’t miss the Doburoku festival from October 14-19, with the main celebration on 14th and 15th of October. To complete the experience or if you’re planning to stay for the Doburuku festival, there are several Ryokan guest houses in the village. You may check Japanese Guest Houses for their rates and availability. For lunch, you can try the Irori restaurant. At a price of ¥1620, you’ll have a complete set meal — fish, rice, miso soup, vegetables, tofu, pork or beef cooked with special sauce, and rice crispies for dessert.

Hitsumabushi Bincho restaurant in the 7th floor of Lachic Shop building in Sakae serves one of the most delicious eel dishes I ever had in my life. The smoked eel with its coated sweet sauce and perfect cooked meat will make you want to order more. There are lots of japanese restaurants and fast food chains to choose from in the Sakae area and in the Oasis complex. Tipping is not common in Nagoya . To settle your bill, you are expected to approach the cashier on your way out. The cashier is usually stationed by the entrance/exit. Spend your 1-yen coins when paying at supermarkets or convenience stores . You won’t be able to use them at vendo machines. I always end up going home with a pocketful of 1-yen coins and now I don’t know what to do with them. Hahaha. Many vending machines serve both cold and hot drinks . Most people are surprised to learn about the hot options. Really helpful when you’re out in the cold. Japanese bills look alike (same color). What varies is the size of the bill. The ¥1000 and ¥10,000 can be confusing so be careful. However, the Japanese are highly UNLIKELY to take advantage. They will even be the first to tell you. When using the escalator, keep left if you’re not moving . If you have a cold or cough, wear surgical masks in public . Locals wear those not because they don’t want to get sick but because they don’t want to pass on the illness to others. Learn a few Japanese phrases . The most useful would be Sumimasen (Excuse me, sorry) and Arigatoo gozaimasu (Thank you)."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/01/where-to-stay-in-tokyo/,japan,"Where to Stay in Tokyo Tokyo is vast. We often see it as a single city, but it’s actually a lot more complicated than that. It’s a metropolitan prefecture. (Wait, what? Uhm, let me explain.) It’s not a single city but not your usual Japanese prefecture either. It’s something that is unique to Tokyo. Think of it as a cluster of cities, municipalities, and special wards. It’s vast and dense. Together, it is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with over 37 million residents.       What many refer to as Tokyo is actually what used to be Tokyo City, which is now broken down into 23 Special Wards, each operating as an individual city. You shouldn’t be too concerned about this because in practice, you will hardly feel it. All these wards seem to live and breathe as one giant creature. The good news is, Tokyo’s vastness means you have a lot of accommodation options. Many of these wards are ideal temporary homes. The bad news is, it can get confusing. But that’s why we’re writing this post. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Ideal Places to Stay Top 5 Budget Hotels Under $70 Search for more: Tokyo Hotels Top 5 Tokyo Hostels Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Ideal Places to Stay Before we give our recommendations, you need to understand first the JR Yamanote Line, a train loop that runs around the city and links its major “districts.” You remember the 23 special wards I mentioned earlier? This railway line somewhat serves as the boundary of it. The area within the loop is considered Central Tokyo. Map created by RailRider , licensed under CC Why is it important? Because the good majority of Tokyo’s top tourist spots are located along the JR Yamanote Line. In other words, if you want to see the key attractions, you will be using this line more often than any other line. This makes it an essential consideration in choosing which area you should stay. Okay, now that we have that out of the way, let’s get to the recommendations. Most online sources recommend three locations: Shinjuku , Shibuya , and the Tokyo Station area . I agree. They’re all close to Yamanote Line and direct airport bus services. There are also numerous shops and restaurants around. However, I prefer Ueno (in Taito ward) for a lot of personal reasons. Ueno is only 40-70 minutes away from the airport by train (via Keisei as mentioned above). It is important to me because I dislike switching trains and walking long distances when I have 30 kilos of baggage on my shoulders. Ueno is also closer to Akihabara than any of the three other locations. Akihabara is my absolute favorite place in Tokyo. Ueno harbors a number of branches of Hotel Mystays , a budget hotel chain that I like. Asakusa is something to consider too. It may not be along Yamanote Line and it’s not a shopping district, but it has an Old Tokyo feel around it that you might appreciate. Staying here also means you’re close to Senso-ji (Asakusa Kannon Temple). Top 5 Budget Hotels Under $70 1.

On my last trip to Tokyo, it snowed. It would have been perfectly normal, but it was November and the first snow of the season usually falls in January. It was the first November snow in the Japanese capital in 50 years. And I was there. It was a foreshadowing. I never expected that just two months after the trip, I would be back in Japan. This time, in Sapporo.       Hokkaido has always hugged the top spot on my bucket list, way above other major Japan destinations, mainly for its longer winters and tight embrace of snow. Spending most of my life in the tropics, I’ve been kept hostage by my fascination with snow. Many of us whose roots are planted near the equator once imagined ourselves in that snowglobe we shook dreamily when we were kids. Snow is a reward, something that we could only see if we work hard enough to afford it, after we had been burdened by life’s many responsibilities. While I’m aware that too much of it has a dark side, for the young, naive me, snow is not ice powder but fairy dust, the stuff that magical places are made of. It’s no wonder I had planned on someday being able to join the Sapporo Snow Festival, but like that November snowfall, I never imagined it would come way sooner.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Sapporo City This post is brought to you by Sapporo City Tourism Office. It all began when the tourism bureau of Sapporo invited us to explore their city as part of their strengthened efforts to increase the number of international tourists. The northernmost prefectural capital in Japan, Sapporo requires a bit more effort to reach. Yet, it is the country’s fifth biggest city by population, which has significantly grown only in the past decades. Sapporo is one of the youngest urban areas Japan. According to tourism officials we talked to during our stay, before development began to take over in 1857, there were only 7 people living here. And because it was built not too long ago, the design of the city didn’t come about organically. It was measured and developed according to plan. The city’s blueprint is an almost perfect grid, with the Ekimae Avenue (north to south) and Odori Park (east to west) as the main axes. Much of the public infrastructures, like the subway system, were built in preparation for 1972 Winter Olympics. Here are a few more facts you need to know: Language : Japanese (Nihongo). English isn’t widely spoken. Currency : Japanese Yen (JPY, ¥). JPY 1000 is roughly USD 8.92, EUR 8.12, PHP 450 (as of Feb 2017). Modes of payment : Cash is preferred. Electricity Info : 100V. Type A sockets. Plugs have two flat pins. Type B is sometimes used but not that common.   Best Time to Visit Sapporo Winter, of course. Although the weather isn’t always comfortable, much of what Sapporo has to offer is best enjoyed in the cold months. It gets 6m of snow a year, and the first of the season usually falls in October. By December, the entire city is already a winter wonderland, and temperatures continue to drop as the season progresses. Here are more reasons to consider visiting when it’s covered in white blanket. (Warning, though: It can get really cold, with average nighttime temperatures reaching as low as -8C.) Sapporo Snow Festival , an annual week-long event held in early February, showcases giant ice and snow sculptures in many parts of the city, with the one in Odori Park getting the most attention. Last year alone, it attracted almost 2 million visitors. Sapporo International Ski Marathon , a cross-country skiing marathon, starts here. Sapporo White Illumination runs from mid-November to December. Sapporo is a popular choice for skiing and other winter sports. April is when it gets warmer and snow begins to melt. Have you been dreaming of cherry blossoms but you’re always unable to travel in March or April? Sapporo to the rescue. The first bloom of sakura happens much later in Sapporo than in other major cities, usually in early May. Autumn is good, too, if you wish to see its landscapes get painted bright red and orange. The Sapporo Autumn Festival happens in September, but make sure to bring a cardigan. If you plan to visit in October, you will need a jacket.   How to Get to Sapporo By Plane Sapporo is served by two airports, the new Chitose Airport and the Okadama Airport. If you’re flying to Sapporo from overseas, there’s a big chance you’ll be using Chitose. However, international flights are limited to China, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, Honolulu, Guam, and Australia. Most journeys make a connection in Tokyo or another major city. FROM TOKYO. The flight from Tokyo to Sapporo usually takes 1 hour and 40 minutes. JetStar offers round-trip flights for less than USD 100 (PHP 5000). Skyscanner FROM OSAKA. Flights from Osaka takes around 2 hours but usually costs just a tad higher. Skyscanner FROM MANILA. If you’re coming from Manila, the lowest regular, year-round fares are often offered by Taiwan’s flag-carrier China Airlines. Manila to Sapporo But you can find much much cheaper promo tickets if you book the legs of your trip separately. For example, JetStar is known to sell roundtrip Manila-Tokyo promo tickets for as low as P7000. If you’re able to snag that and then book a Tokyo-Sapporo flight for P5000, then you’ll only be spending P12,000 for your full journey.   By Train Taking the train to Sapporo from other major cities outside Hokkaido is both time-consuming and expensive, which is why I don’t recommend it unless you’re on a multi-city tour around Japan. From Tokyo Take the Shinkansen Hayabusa to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto Station . Travel time: 4.5 hours. Reserved seat fee: ¥11,130 ($100, P5000). Switch to Limited Express Hokuto Line and alight at Sapporo Station. Travel time: 3 hours, 40 minutes. Reserved seat fee: ¥1550 ($14, P700); Unreserved seat ¥1290 ($11.5, P580). The whole journey takes over 8 hours, not counting the layover time. The total fare for 2 legs is ¥14,140. That’s on top of the seat fees. So the whole journey would cost you around ¥26,820 ($240, P12,000). That’s just one way! From Osaka To get to Sapporo from Osaka, you will need to make a transfer in Tokyo. From Shin-Osaka Station (not to be confused with Osaka Station), take the Shinkansen Nozomi to Tokyo Station . Travel time: 2 hours, 33 minutes. Reserved seat fee: ¥5700 ($51, P2550); Unreserved seat fee: ¥4870 ($44, P2180). Take the Shinkansen Hayabusa to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto Station . Travel time: 4.5 hours. Reserved seat fee: ¥11,130 ($100, P5000). Switch to Limited Express Hokuto Line and alight at Sapporo Station . Travel time: 3 hours, 40 minutes. Reserved seat fee: ¥1550 ($14, P700); Unreserved seat ¥1290 ($11.5, P580). Total travel time is 10.5 hours , excluding the layovers. The total fare from Osaka to Sapporo is ¥18,140. Add the seat fees and you’ll have to shell out around ¥36,520 ($326, P16,400). See now why we advise against it? Flying is faster and much, much cheaper. But if you’re visiting multiple cities, then you will get great savings if you just book a JR Pass. This makes sense if you want to explore not just one or two cities. For example, if your itinerary includes Osaka, Tokyo, and Sapporo in 7 days. Also, riding the bullet train across the Japanese countryside is quite an experience too.   Where to Book JR Pass If you’re visiting multiple cities in Japan and you’re staying for 7 days, you can save A LOT OF MONEY by getting a Train Pass.

Take the JR Rapid Airport Line headed for Otaru or Sapporo. Get off at Sapporo Station. Fare is ¥1070 ($9.6, P480). You may reserve a seat for ¥520 if you want, but you can simply hop on to the cars with unreserved seats (FREE). Travel time: 37 minutes. Jozankei Shrine.   How to Get Around Sapporo Thanks to grid design, it is easy to explore the city center of Sapporo even on foot. You can simply divide the map into four quadrants with the Ekimae Avenue (north to south) and Odori Park (east to west) as the main axes. Each block in the city measures 100 meters so it’s not difficult to keep track how far you are from where you came from. I thoroughly enjoyed walking around even in the cold, cold evenings. And if you’re walking along Odori, it’s literally a walk in the park! For not-so-short distances, there’s always the subway. To make it even easier, go to Hyperdia.com/en/ on your web broweser. Enter your origin and the station where you’re going. It will then display possible route options including how much the ride costs and transfers needed to get there. At the train station, you can double check the price. Just look at the route map, usually above the ticket machines. The map displays the price based on distance. Sometimes, the map is in Japanese characters only, which is why Hyperdia is useful.   How to Stay Connected in Sapporo There are a lot of FREE wi-fi spots throughout Japan, but if you want to stay connected 24/7, you can rent a mobile wi-fi or get a local 4G SIM. Pocket Wifi Rental The cheapest way of getting connected to the Internet in Japan is renting a mobile wi-fi. It can accommodate multiple users so if you’re a group, you just need one and split the cost. You’ll find a lot of them around, even at the airport. However, based on experience, they are so in demand that every time I try to get one, there’s always none left. Fortunately, with Klook, you can reserve one and just pick it up at the airport ! For 4G Wifi Rental: Reserve Here — Local 4G SIM If you opt with a 4G Data SIM, you can choose between two packages: unlimited 4G data for 8 days (around P1500) and 3GB data for 8 days (around P1100). If you’re a heavy data user, best to go with the Unlimited Plan. You can pick up the SIM card at Chitose Airport.

A good sign that the snow is good to be stepped on is if it’s white and powdery. If it’s gray or blackish and looks compact because a lot of people have stepped on it, there’s a big chance they’re slippery. So be careful. You can also buy those anti-slip… uhm… things (I don’t know what they’re called, haha) that you can attach to your shoes, just not the metal ones. (The metal ones have to be removed when you go inside an establishment.) Make time allowance for the traffic . Sapporo’s best attractions are so far apart, and while the subway is there, some can only be reached by bus or by car. If that’s the case, consider the time you’re gonna spend in traffic. Japanese chocolates and biscuits are a bit cheaper at the New Chitose Airport than in Haneda or Narita . For example, Royce’s Nama Chocolate costs ¥720 per box in Chitose and ¥780 in Haneda. I know that’s not much, but savings are savings. If you have low cold tolerance, purchase a heat pack from a convenience store and keep it near your body (inside your jacket). This will make your trip more comfortable. Tipping is not common in Sapporo . To settle your bill, you are expected to approach the cashier on your way out. The cashier is usually stationed by the entrance/exit. Many vending machines serve both cold and hot drinks . Most people are surprised to learn about the hot options. Really helpful when you’re out in the cold. Japanese bills look alike (same color). What varies is the size of the bill. The ¥1000 and ¥10,000 can be confusing so be careful. However, the Japanese are highly UNLIKELY to take advantage. They will even be the first to tell you. When using the escalator , keep left if you’re not moving. Learn a few Japanese phrases. The most useful would be Sumimasen (Excuse me, sorry) and Arigatoo gozaimasu (Thank you)."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/02/tokyo-budget-hotels/,japan,"Tokyo: Top 10 Budget Hotels Under $70 Tokyo has always had a reputation for being an expensive city. Although there is some truth in that, it is not as expensive as most people think. Many major cities around the world have overtaken the Japanese capital in terms of soaring cost of living. One can find plenty of ways to avoid bleeding money during their visit.       Still, there are many sides to this bustling metropolis that remain daunting for the frugal traveler, like accommodations. Sure, the industry has found ways to offer cheaper alternatives like capsule hotels. But the truth is, if you’re not into hostels and capsules, lodging remains generally expensive. Fortunately, there are budget hotels that cater to the budget-conscious. If you have only USD 70 (PHP3500) budget per night and you need specific lodging recommendations, here are the Top 10 Best hotels and hostels for you, according to TripAdvisor ratings (as of Jan 2017).

For a region that gets buried in snow for half the year, Hokkaido enjoys a reputation as one of Japan’s food meccas, a major destination for local and foreign foodies.       Many of its native dishes have found popularity throughout the rest of Japan and beyond. Even for non-native dishes, Hokkaido locals have found ways to bring in something new and interesting, making each dish distinctly their own. Aside from climate, geography also plays a huge role in Hokkaido cuisine. As an island with vast fields of fertile land, Hokkaido isn’t wanting for fresh ingredients and assorted flavors. If you’re planning a trip to Hokkaido, consider this food and beverage guide for the region’s top eats. Along with a brief description of each dish, we’ve included some affordable recommendations, as well as their price range. Click here for our multi-city Hokkaido travel guide Ramen Soba Soup Curry Ishikari-nabe &amp; Kani-nabe (Hot Pot) Seafood Crabs (Kani) Sea Urchin (Uni) Hokke Genghis Khan Sapporo Beer and Sake Hokkaido Ice Cream Yubari melons Foodie tips for Hokkaido travelers Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Ramen Sapporo-style Ramen Ramen is as Japanese as noodles can get, and every region in Japan has their own take on this classic dish. For its part, Hokkaido contributed not just one but three well-received varieties: The Sapporo, Hakodate, and Asahikawa styles. Of the three, Sapporo-style ramen is the most familiar. Sapporo ramen is defined by its soup base (made from miso , or fermented soybean paste), combined with chicken or fish broth and liberal amounts of butter. This rich soup is accompanied by thick, chewy noodles, and topped with pork ( tonkotsu ), corn, cabbage, and seafood. By contrast, Hakodate-style ramen is a relatively simpler variety. It has a salt ( shio ) base with a clear broth and light flavor. Hakodate ramen has thin, stringy noodles, and topped with tonkotsu, spring onions, boiled eggs, and bamboo shoots. Not to be outdone by Sapporo and Hakodate, Asahikawa ramen is characterized by its soy sauce ( shoyu ) base. Rich, fatty, and often spicy, with wavy noodles and a thin film of oil that traps the heat, it is food specially designed for Asahikawa, Japan’s coldest city. Where to eat: There’s an unlimited number of fine ramen restaurants in Hokkaido, but for each ramen variety the following are good places to start: Sapporo ramen: Ganso Ramen Yokocho (Original Ramen Street) in Susukino (3 min walk from Susukino Subway Station in Sapporo) Hakodate ramen: Seiryu-ken (5 min walk from Hakodate JR Station in Hakodate) Asahikawa ramen: Asahikawa Ramen Village (5 min walk from Minami-Nagayama JR Station in Asahikawa) Cost for each bowl is between JPY 700 – 900. Soba In addition to ramen, another popular noodle dish in Hokkaido is soba or buckwheat noodles. Buckwheat is a common crop in Hokkaido, and the region accounts for about a third of Japan’s buckwheat production. As such, many renowned soba restaurants come from this region. Soba noodles are thick and chewy, but also soft and springy. It is a flexible dish that can be served hot or cold, depending on the season. Cold soba is regularly served with tsuyu , a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, sake and mirin. Once you’re through eating the noodles, you can mix the remaining tsuyu with hot soba water for a flavorful wash-down. Hot soba is served primarily as a soup, capped with seafood tempura and fresh vegetables. Where to eat: Shinoya Handmade Soba Noodle if you’re in Sapporo (5 min walk from Nishi Juitchome Subway Station), price at JPY 500 – 1000 per serving. Soup Curry Soup Curry is a popular soup dish made from classic curry spices, but instead of being thick and oily, as is typical of curry dishes, soup curry is light and watery. The dish is often topped with chicken or pork, seafood, or vegetables. Actually, the toppings vary per restaurant, as each has their own preferences and styles. Where to eat: RAMAI, a restaurant chain with several branches throughout Sapporo. The central branch is a 5-minute walk from Shiseikanshogakko-Mae Tram Station. Soup Curry dishes here start at JPY 1000. Ishikari-nabe &amp; Kani-nabe (Hot Pot) Ishikari-nabe is a hot pot that took its name from the longest river in Hokkaido. It has a fish-based broth, usually Hokkaido salmon (hokke). Like Sapporo ramen, Ishikari-nabe uses miso as a base, which makes it distinct from other hot pots. Mixed with the stew are ingredients originating from the Ishikari region, like salmon, cabbages, mushrooms, and tofu. Another local hot pot dish, kani nabe , uses crab as its primary ingredient, with additional toppings of seaweed (kombu), fish flakes, and winter vegetables. Where to eat: Takara Sushi at Ishikari City, or Shabu Shabu Dining Youzen in Sapporo, where buffet prices start at JPY 2900 per person. Seafood Surrounded by three major bodies of water (the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean), Hokkaido enjoys a year-round bounty of fresh seafood. Hokkaido is the leading producer of seafood products in Japan, and the local cuisine reflects its significant contribution to the industry. Crabs (Kani) Crabs are a major delicacy in Hokkaido. Even airports have their own crab markets! You can order crabs directly at the New Chitose Airport, and have it packaged, ready for check-in. Preferred crab varieties include king crabs, snow crabs and horsehair crabs. Crabs are either eaten raw as part of a sashimi or donburi bowl, boiled in salt water, or grilled. Where to get: The New Chitose Airport has its own crab market. The Sapporo Seafood Market and the Hakodate Morning Market are also great for buying and eating crabs. Crabs, however, aren’t cheap. To satisfy your crab craving, be ready to shell out at least JPY 5000 per meal. Sea Urchin (Uni) Uni or sea urchin is another esteemed seafood in Hokkaido. Hokkaido’s uni tastes almost fruit-like, while still maintaining a briny sea flavor. Harvesting uni is a meticulous process, and should be eaten within the day of harvest. Where to eat: Most supermarkets sell uni, often packed in thin plastic boxes, but the freshest uni can be found in the seafood markets, like Sapporo’s Nijo Market or Hakodate’s Morning Market. Fresh uni is around JPY 1000 per pack. Hokke The ports of Hokkaido, specifically Hakodate and Otaru, are known as primary sources of mackerel (locally known as hokke) in the region, and smoked mackerel is a favorite dish in these areas. Smoked mackerel is a bit like our own tinapa , but not as salty or dry. The mackerel is smoked to the point that the flesh can be peeled easily from the skin. Where to eat: Minshuku Aozukashokudo restaurant, overlooking the Otaru coast. Aside from smoked mackerel, you can also try out their grilled fish, squid, oysters, and crabs. Meals are around the JP 1000 – 1500 range. As for mixed seafood dishes, a must-try is kaisendon , or sashimi rice bowl. It’s essentially a rice bowl topped with various raw seafood. Popular at lunchtime as a light meal, kaisendon toppings vary from place to place. In Hokkaido, kaisendon usually comes with regional specialties, like crab, uni, salmon roe and shrimp, with pickled vegetable sides. Where to eat: Kita no Ryoba in Sapporo, right next to the Chuo Wholesale Market, or, if you’re in Hakodate, Ekini Ichiba at the Hakodate Morning Market. Prices range from JPY 500 – 1500. Genghis Khan A post shared by 정재훈 (@hoon_ganzi) on Jan 7, 2018 at 5:41pm PST Genghis Khan ( Jingisukan ) is a grilled mutton dish endemic to Hokkaido. Lamb meat is grilled on its own fat, cooked on a metal dome, with vegetables on the side. Its name is derived from the fact that, for the Japanese, any mutton dish is associated with Mongolian cuisine. Also, it helps that the domed grill resembles the helmet of a medieval Mongolian warrior. Coupled with beer, jingisukan is a favorite dish in group or family night-outs. Where to eat: Sapporo Beer Garden in Sapporo. It’s right next to the Sapporo Beer Museum and a 15-minute walk from Higashi-kuyakusho-mae Subway Station. An all-you-can-eat buffet costs JPY 2900. Sapporo Beer and Sake Of course, a Hokkaido food guide is incomplete if we don’t mention Sapporo Beer . Sapporo is the home the oldest breweries in Japan, with continuous production since the 19th Century. If you’re new to Sapporo Beer, the best version to start is their Premium and Light varieties. As for taste, Sapporo beer is sweet and crisp, with a clear hoppy aroma. Hokkaido also prides itself with their locally-brewed sake . Chitosetsuru, the first sake brewery in Hokkaido, is located in downtown Sapporo. Sapporo is noted for its cool, pristine groundwater, perfect for sake brewing. Nikka whisky , the famous Japanese brand, also has a brewing factory in the Hokkaido city of Yoichi. Where to drink: Sapporo beer: The Sapporo Beer Museum provides an in-depth look at the brewing process, its history and impact in Japanese culture. Plus, for a JPY 500, you get to sample three different brews at the end of the tour. Sake: Chitusetsuru has its own sake museum where one can take samples of their many brews, as well as enjoy sake-flavored products like ice cream and pastries. Hokkaido Ice Cream The cold is no deterrent to the local sweet tooth, and it’s interesting that soft-serve ice cream is such a popular treat in a place as cold as Hokkaido. Hokkaido leads Japan in dairy production, so it’s not uncommon for Hokkaido locals to include a lot of dairy in their food, especially in desserts. The rich, smooth texture is what defines Hokkaido ice cream. While classic flavors like vanilla, chocolate and cheese remain popular, it’s the local flavors you need to try. Each city or town has its own unusual flavor based on local produce, like lavender (Furano), sake (Sapporo), rose (Eniwa), as well as the world-famous Yubari melon. Where to eat: Soft-serve ice cream: The New Chitose Airport has more than 20 varieties of soft-serve ice cream available within its vicinities. Major department stores and transport terminals also have ice cream kiosks. Price will range between JPY 200 – 400 per cone/cup. Yubari melons A post shared by Lady M. Mumu (@m.ladybehindthekitchen) on Jul 21, 2017 at 1:26am PDT Yubari melons got its name from the resort city of Yubari east of Sapporo, where most of the esteemed fruit is cultivated. These melons are noted for their sweetness, their almost perfect roundness, and their smooth, thin rind. While us Filipinos are used to having tropical fruits all the time, the Japanese consider them as luxury, so much that a pair of flawless Yubari King melons were once sold at an auction for a whopping JPY 3,000,000, dubbing it “the most expensive fruit in the world”. Where to eat: Yubari melons: A Yubari melon, if bought as one whole fruit, is EXPENSIVE. Typically, Vendors will just sell them per slice, at around JPY 200 – 400. Fresh melons are often sold in morning markets. Foodie tips for Hokkaido travelers Sapporo Autumn Festival . If you happen to travel in Autumn, Sapporo holds a food festival showcasing the best in Hokkaido cuisine. Held in Odori Park, the Sapporo Autumn Fest features food and products from almost every city and municipality in Hokkaido. It’s a great way to try out most of the region’s delicacies, all in one venue. Major transport hubs frequently have adjacent food markets and restaurants. Examples include the New Chitose Airport and the Sapporo JR Station. If you have some leeway to splurge, you can try out a few of the izakaya pubs and shabu-shabu places found in Sapporo, Otaru, and other major cities. Must-try food places include the Sapporo Beer Garden and Ramen Yokocho in Susukino District. On the flipside, if your budget is limited, convenience stores (konbini), supermarkets, and vending machines offer delicious food at affordable prices. My personal favorites are the various onigiri (rice balls) found in Lawson and Family Mart. Special thanks to our friends from Jetstar Japan for making our trip to Hokkaido happen. Jetstar offers the only low cost option for travel to Sapporo from Manila, via Tokyo or Osaka. Other than Sapporo, Jetstar Japan also flies to 11 domestic destinations from Tokyo (Narita), including Miyazaki, Fukuoka, and Kumamoto. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2018/03/things-to-do-in-kyoto-itinerary/,japan,"KYOTO ON A BUDGET 2018: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary It was mid-summer when I set foot in Kyoto for the first time. The deciduous forest of the Arashiyama district was very lush and green, awfully green. Green is great; I love green. But as a guy who hailed from a tropical island carpeted in evergreen rainforests, it was not really the color I was excited to feast my eyes on. The longer I walked, the more I realized that it was a mistake booking June tickets to Japan. What was I thinking? Was I even thinking when I booked it? But kicking myself in the butt lasted for only a minute. Summer may not be the best time to be here, but the proverbial silver lining appeared amidst the greenery. There were fewer tourists, and the weather was pleasant, perfect for a long afternoon walk. That or I was just mastering the art of sweet lemoning.       Before that trip ended, I did what every other typical travel blogger does when writing about a place they enjoyed tremendously: make a solemn pledge to return. And return I did. Multiple times. Because I’m typical like that. LOL. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? What You Need to Know When is the Best Time to Visit Kyoto?

Important Reminders Related Posts What You Need to Know Kyoto is the capital of Kyoto Prefecture, which is part of Japan’s Kansai Region (along with Osaka, Nara, Hyogo and a few others). This post is co-presented by Cebu Pacific Air. For over a thousand years, Kyoto was the Imperial capital of Japan, the main reason why it is teeming with structures and customs from the bygone times. This makes the city an attractive choice for foreigners who are interested to dig deeper into traditional Japanese culture. Today, Japan’s seat of power is Tokyo. Yet, Kyoto is still the cultural core of the archipelago. Kyoto remains home to impressively maintained and restored ancient temples and shrines. When most major cities in Japan have shifted to highlighting its modern and futuristic attractions, Kyoto remains steady in its dwelling in the past and flaunting its cultural heritage. Kyoto pulsates at its own pace, a bit slower but curiously mesmerizing. Yosh and Vins in Kyoto Other info you need to know: Language: Japanese (Nihongo). The majority of the locals seldom speak English, but most of the signs and other tourist promotional materials have English translations. Currency: Japanese Yen (JPY, ¥). JPY 1000 is around USD 9.36, EUR 7.60, PHP 484 (as of February 2018). Money Exchange. There are a lot of money changers throughout Osaka and Kyoto, but save yourself the trouble and just exchange currencies before your trip. SANRY’S has good rates. You can also withdraw from ATMs when you’re there, but they’re pretty hard to find. Most of the ATMs we saw didn’t accept international cards. Modes of payment: Most establishments prefer cash payment, but many of them also accept credit card transactions. Electricity Info : 100V. Type A sockets. Plugs have two flat pins. Type B is sometimes used but not that common. When is the Best Time to Visit Kyoto? Every season highlights a different side of Kyoto: clad in the fiery colors of autumn, dressed in white snow in winter, adorned with the pink glow of cherry blossoms in spring, and, finally, drowned in a sea of verdancy in summer. Each has its own pros and cons, but if you’re after visual spectacle, these two will be your best bets: Late March to early April for the cherry blossoms Mid- to late November for the colors of fall Sakura in Kyoto Spring is also the beginning of peak season, when cost of flights and hotel rooms begin to rise. Yes, the sakura experience is magical, but prepare to shell out more dough and share the place with a bigger crowd. Summer is also part of the peak season. If you’re from the tropics like me and you want to explore in an atmosphere different from what you’re used to, stay away from the summer months. Not only are these months crowded, they can also be too hot. Longer days also mean you have more hours of daylight, more time to explore, and more opportunities to take wonderful photos. Autumn is a great time to be in Kyoto because this is when the prices drop, crowds thin, and foliage turns fiery orange and red. Temperature is also pleasant and comfortable for sightseeing. Winter is great for budget travelers because airfares are lowest at this time. However, establishments tend to open later and close earlier. You might also want to avoid these dates: Golden Week (April 29 – May 5) Obon Festival (August 13–15) Cherry Blossoms Season (Late March-Early April) These dates bring the biggest crowds and steepest prices.

The base fare per leg was only P20, but including all the taxes, I only paid PHP 5984 for the roundtrip ticket (PHP 2992 per way). That includes a prepaid baggage allowance of 20 Kg. Not bad. Not bad at all. Search for cheap flights here . Kansai Airport to Kyoto Kyoto is only 1.5 hours from Kansai Airport by train, longer by bus. By Train There are many routes you can take to get to Kyoto from Kansai airport, but many of them entail multiple transfers. What I recommend is taking the Limited Express Haruka Train that will take you straight to Kyoto from the airport. Limited Express Haruka Travel time: 80 minutesRegular Fare: ¥1880 + ¥970 (seat fee) You can save a lot of money in two ways: JR West Kansai Pass . If you’re planning on visiting multiple cities within Kansai Region in a few days, this is great for you because you can enjoy unlimited rides to most JR lines including the Haruka train to Kyoto . More info about the Kansai Pass here . ICOCA + HARUKA . If you’re itinerary is restricted in Kyoto and/or Osaka only, the best option for you is getting an ICOCA card. ICOCA isn’t really a pass; it’s more like a stored value card. You still pay for every time you use the train, but you don’t need to purchase a single journey each time. Moreover, JR West has an ongoing promo: If you present your ICOCA card upon purchase, you can grab a Haruka ticket for only ¥1600 . That’s a significant discount! RESERVE AN ICOCA CARD HERE If you decide to purchase either the West Kansai or ICOCA via Klook, here’s how to use them. Book a ticket with Klook. When the transaction is complete, you will be emailed a mobile voucher. Print it out or save it on your phone. On the day of your trip, upon arrival at Kansai Airport, find the HIS Counter at the Arrival Hall. There is usually a small KLOOK logo displayed in front of the counter. Show your mobile voucher to the staff.– If you booked an ICOCA Card, you will be given the actual ICOCA card.– If you booked a JR Kansai Pass, you will be given a physical voucher. Proceed to the Train Station on the second floor of the building opposite the Arrival Hall. Find the JR Ticket Counters.– If you booked an ICOCA Card, tell the staff you’re booking a Haruka Train and show your ICOCA card to avail of the discount. Prepare to pay ¥1600.– If you booked the JR Kansai Pass, exchange the voucher given to you for the ACTUAL JR KANSAI PASS. Enter through the JR Gates of the Station. There are 2 gates; the other one is for Nankai Line.– If you’re using the JR Kansai Pass, just approach the staff at the counter and show your pass. They will stamp it with the last date you can use it. You don’t have to use it immediately. The count will begin on the day of first use. For example, if you purchase a 2-day pass and you claim it on Monday, it doesn’t mean that you have to use it on Monday and Tuesday. You may choose to use it any day before expiration. If you use it for the first time on Thursday, you can use it on that day and Friday. When you use it for the first time, approach the staff at the counter at any of the station and he will stamp the final date you may use the pass.– If you’re using your Haruka ticket, just feed the ticket to the machines and pick it up on the other side of the gate. Check your platform on the screens around the station. Go to the designated platform and board the right train.

Where to Stay in Kyoto Which part of the city is best for travelers? Definitely, the area surrounding Kyoto Station. Kyoto Station is the heart of the city. It is impossible to explore Kyoto without setting foot in its vicinity. One way or another, you’ll find yourself here, whether you’re catching a train or bus or looking for a place to eat. Hence, the closer your are to the central station, the more convenient and hassle-free your trip will be. Here are some of the best hostels and guesthouses near Kyoto Station, as ranked by Traveloka users (as of March 2018). I was able to try K’s House myself, and it was a delightful experience.

Rates are usually between JPY 800-900 per day. However, they are very in demand so there might not be any more available if you arrive in the late afternoon or evening. Some establishments accept only credit card transactions. If you really want to make sure you get a mobile wifi, you can reserve one in advance via Klook for only PhP 389 per day for unlimited 4G access. That’s a lot cheaper than those you will find at Kansai airport. The best part, if you’re a group, you can connect multiple devices hassle-free. You can then split the cost with your friends. You can pick up the device at the airport. No deposit is required . RESERVE THIS NOW Local SIM If you opt with a 4G Data SIM, you can choose between two packages: unlimited 4G data for 8 days (around ¥3360) and 3GB data for 8 days (around ¥2160). If you’re a heavy data user, best to go with the Unlimited Plan. You can pick up the SIM card at Kansai Airport. RESERVE A LOCAL SIM NOW How to Get Around Osaka Almost every key tourist attraction in Kyoto is accessible by train. Hence, if you become familiar with the train system, you’re good to go. But it’s not that easy. Kyoto Station alone is massive. It is a behemoth of a terminal. Train and subway lines operating to, from and around the city converge here. You have to make sure you’re on the right platform and you’re boarding the right car of the right train. A few trains split into two at one point and part ways. You don’t want to be on the wrong car. One thing that has proven helpful to me again and again is Hyperdia. It’s a web-based search engine that would tell you train schedules and routes instantly. Just make sure you know the closest train station to your destination and let Hyperdia do the rest. Here’s more info : HOW TO USE HYPERDIA . There are also train passes that will make your journey more hassle-free. JR Pass JR Pass is a good option if you’re on a multi-city journey across Japan. But here’s the caveat: It only makes sense for multiple long-distance travels. If that’s not clear enough, let me stress that even more. MULTIPLE LONG-DISTANCE travels. For example: Osaka-Tokyo-Sapporo or Tokyo-Osaka-Hiroshima-Fukuoka. If that sounds like the trip you want to take, then go ahead. Get a JR Pass. Note, though, that you can’t purchase a JR Pass in Japan because it’s offered only to foreign tourists. Thankfully, you can book via Klook. If you live in the Philippines, the pass will be delivered to you in 7 days. Klook offers the cheapest JR Passes available. CHECK JR PASS RATES HERE JR West Kansai Rail Pass If you’re planning to visit places that are relatively close to each other — like Osaka-Nara-Kyoto — this is what you need, not a (nationwide) JR PASS. This pass offers unlimited rail and bus rides to and in many cities in Kansai Region including Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and Nara. You can also use this to travel from Kansai Airport to Osaka and back. Available in 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-day validity variants. Note that this pass is only accepted on JR Trains. Do you need this pass? If you plan on staying within Kyoto and not visiting other cities, this is not for you. Just get an ICOCA Card or single-journey tickets at the station. If you plan to visit Kyoto, Nara, Kobe or other cities in Kansai, this could be great for you. IMPORTANT! You can’t buy this pass in Japan. You have to purchase ONLINE. This pass is meant for foreign nationals traveling as a temporary visitor (tourist) in Japan. You can book online below: 1-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE 2-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE 3-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE 4-Day Pass . RESERVE HERE ICOCA Card The ICOCA Card isn’t a pass. It’s a prepaid IC card. It’s sort of Kansai’s version of Tokyo’s SUICA or PASMO Card. When you use an ICOCA card, you still pay for every trip. You just need to quickly hover the card over the reader at the station gates and you’re through. You can also use it not just on trains but also on buses, lockers, vending machines, and even convenience stores. Yep, lockers. The ICOCA card works on lockers at train stations! You can also use it to snag some discount on your train to or from Kansai Airport. The best direct journey from the airport to Kyoto (or vice versa) is the HARUKA Train. And if you have an ICOCA Card, it will slash a significant amount from the ticket price. We’ve used it on our recent trip. We simply had to go to JR Counter, show our ICOCA Card, and tell the staff we’re booking a Haruka train. Normally, it costs around ¥4000 one-way, including the seat fee. But with ICOCA, it’s only ¥1600 . You can get an ICOCA card from Klook, which is already preloaded with ¥1500 + the deposit of ¥500. You can get the deposit when you return the card. RESERVE AN ICOCA CARD HERE Places to Visit in Kyoto Osaka may be too obsessed with its ever-growing skyline but Kyoto is quite the opposite. Development is noticeable but it shines in places where it dwells in the past. Historic districts and ancient structures are its biggest crowd-drawers — Fushimi Inari Shrine, Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion), Gion District, and the Arashiyama District. Before I enumerate the attractions I recommend, consider exploring in style by renting a kimono! Kimono Rental Kimono Rental. Image provided by Klook. We’ve done this on our last trip, and it made our trip much more unforgettable. If you want to take awesome photos at the each tourist spot, try dressing up in a full traditional kimono set. RESERVE A KIMONO HERE Fushimi Inari Shrine Nearest Station : JR Inari StationAdmission Fee : FREE Fushimi Inari Shrine Fushimi Inari Shrine (伏見稲荷大社 or Fushimi Inari Taisha) is the most well-known and most important Shinto site that is dedicated to Inari in the city of Kyoto, Japan. While the thousand torii gates are the most picturesque parts of the site, they are but trails that connect the shrines and other places of worship. The shrine was built in 711 by one Hata-no-Irogu. According to legend, he was a powerful man, who one day shot an arrow at rice-cake target. To his surprise, the rice cake transformed into a swan and perched on a peak of the mountain. Rice began growing at the site, sustaining the community. A shrine was erected as a tribute to the god of rice, Inari. In 816, it was moved to its current location, at the base of the Inariyama hill. More info here: Fushimu Inari Shrine Arashiyama Nearest Station : Saga-Arashiyama Station (JR Sagano/Sanin Line) Arashiyama Bamboo Forest Kyoto’s Arashiyama district is dotted with shrines, temples, and other important landmarks. Many of these can be accessed for FREE. Of these, the most popular are the Tenryuji Temple (which collects a entrance fee) and the adjacent Bamboo Forest. Regarded as the best among the Five Great Zen Temples of Kyoto, Tenryuji Temple has been declared by the Japanese government as a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and in 1994 was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was originally founded in 1339 by Shogun Ashikaga Takauji as a place to console the spirit of Emperor Go-Daigo. Zen master Muso Soseki was the founding priest. Today, it is a major tourist destination, alluring everyone with its Zen beauty and tradition. An exquisite garden encloses this temple, which makes the walk getting here an event in itself. Next to an abbey hall is the Sogen Pond, which is frequented by many species of birds. The trail ends at the start of the bamboo groves. If you have more time, drop by Togetsukyo Bridge, Horinji Temple, and Nanamiya Shrine. You can easily do this tour on your own (DIY-style), but if you have the budget and you want to level up your experience, you can book a Rickshaw Tour and let a local do the footwork and show you around the area.

They are what people from all over the world travel to Kyoto for. While they are very different from each other, their roots are intricately tangled. I was thankful that once in my life my soles touched the ground where these two art forms burgeoned and flourished.

It is the only theme park in Japan where visitors can watch and observe actual filming of period dramas (jidaigeki films). More than 200 movies are shot here every year! But it is more than a movie set. It is a Japanese pop culture explosion contained in a theme park! It was that one attraction in Kyoto that I had a strong personal connection to because it reintroduced me to the heroes of my childhood! Ninja shows, anime artifacts, samurai fighting lessons, and super sentai reunion filled that visit, the most memorable for me. And because I’m shallow like that. Visitors may also choose to rent a full Edo period costume and dress up as a samurai or a geisha so they could explore the park in style!

For the Osaka leg, please read this first: OSAKA TRAVEL GUIDE This itinerary assumes the following: You’re taking Cebu Pacific flight scheduled to arrive in Osaka at 8:10pm. IMPORTANT! In this case, make sure that the first thing you do after going through Immigration and picking up your bags is to head straight to the HIS Office to collect the passes and/or mobile wifi that you booked with Klook because it closes at 10pm. You have an Osaka Amazing Pass, from hereon shall be referred to as OA Pass (¥2397), to save some yen . Having the Osaka Amazing Pass will waive the entrance fees to some of the attractions and unlimited access to the subway. It costs ¥2397 if you book with Klook. RESERVE HERE You have an ICOCA card to make it easier for you to go through train gates and use lockers. RESERVE HERE You DON’T need a JR Pass or Kansai Pass for this itinerary . The OA Pass for the Osaka leg and ICOCA Card for Kyoto are enough. Using the JR Pass will cost much more. You’re staying in a capsule hotel in Namba, like Capsule Hotel ASTIL Dotonbori or Y’s Cabin Osaka Namba (¥3250 per night)for the Osaka leg, and at a dorm near Kyoto Station like K’s House (¥2500 per night) for the Kyoto leg. You’re skipping breakfast . It’s healthy (according to intermittent fasting advocates, hehe) and you’re poor! Make the necessary adjustments to match your schedule and preferences.

Universal Studios Japan eats up the biggest chunk of the budget. You can save a lot by skipping it, if it’s not your priority anyway. Instead, I strongly recommend Toei Studio Movie Park in Kyoto. This is my most-loved theme park in Japan because it’s uniquely Japanese. (More info about that here: Toei Kyoto Studio Park .) This way, the cost goes down to only ¥31,000 (USD 295, PHP15,300) Another way to further reduce the cost is by limiting your food budget to only ¥500 per lunch/dinner. Convenience stores and supermarkets offer cheap meals for much lower. But you’re in Japan! It would be such a shame to visit Osaka and not eat out! You can also find an early morning flight so you can save one hotel night. This itinerary may also be too dense for you. It was for me, haha. In fact, I skipped a few of these because my legs were this close to falling off. That’s because I’m old and lazy. Again, that’s me.   More Tips for the Poor Traveler Here are more tips to help make your trip go smoothly. Lockers . In major stations in Osaka and Kyoto, you’ll find them in many corners. There are two types: electronic and coin lockers. Rental costs ¥300-¥700 depending on the size. In Kyoto, if your hotel is far from Kyoto Station (which is the focal point of everything touristy in the city) and your flight is scheduled at night, you may choose to store your baggage at one of the many lockers scattered at the lower levels of the station. This way, you save a hotel night and does not need to travel back to the hotel just to get your things. Tipping is unusual in Japan. Most restaurants have the cashier stationed by the exit so you pay after your meal, on your way out. When in doubt, ask . The people of Osaka and Kyoto are some of the friendliest I have ever met."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/11/free-walking-tours-osaka-kyoto-diy/,japan,"8 FREE or Cheap Things to Do in Kyoto and Osaka It’s interesting that, given the proximity of Kyoto and Osaka from each other (less than half an hour by train), each city radiates a distinct vibe that distinguishes itself from the other. I noticed it as soon as I stepped off the train station: while Kyoto is all about heritage and tradition, Osaka is fast-paced and adventurous. Kyoto has its temples, shrines and UNESCO sites; Osaka has its cuisine, shopping districts, and amusement parks.       This unique relationship has existed since bygone times. Indeed, an old Japanese saying perfectly describes the two cities’ dichotomy: “Wear kimonos till you drop in Kyoto, eat till you drop in Osaka”. This post is brought to you by Cebu Pacific Air. Yet these differences only make me want to explore the two cities even more, if only to complete the experience. This yin-and-yang, complementary relationship had me convinced that the two cities are somehow designed to be enjoyed as one single destination. For budget-minded travelers, planning for not just one, but two cities teeming with (pricey) attractions can be quite the chore. Thankfully, these cities are more accessible to tourists than ever before. Not only have the visa restrictions loosened, low-cost carriers have been more and more aggressive and competitive in promoting flights to Kansai International Airport, the gateway to Osaka and Kyoto. Cebu Pacific Air , in particular, has been offering cheap fares for Osaka five times a week, with the lowest year-round fare at P6399. That is a great deal already. But you can count on CEB to bring it even lower during seat sales, which happen more often these days. (Tip: Follow them on Facebook and turn on your notifications for their page so you get an alert when they have a new post!) Cebu Pacific Air flies to Osaka 5 times a week. When you’re already in Osaka or Kyoto, everything should be easier. Not everything fun in these destinations should break the bank. In fact, several draws here are affordable to the average traveler. Some are even FREE. Here are seven budget-friendly activities you can do in the two cities; these can easily add a day or two to your itinerary, without the hefty extras to your expenses.   1. TREAT THE HISTORY NERD IN YOU AT OSAKA CASTLE Osaka Castle stands imposing over the entire castle grounds, like a full-armored feudal lord overseeing his vassals. An important monument to Japanese political history, the castle was built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the daimyo responsible for uniting the whole of Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1573-1603 AD). Osaka Castle The castle is the crown jewel of the 106-hectare Osaka Castle Park, where age-old moats and fortifications exist alongside stadiums, restaurants and other contemporary buildings. Osaka Castle is itself a blend of the old and new: while the exterior has remained relatively faithful to the original design, the inside is modern in every aspect, with air-conditioned halls, an elevator, and an observation platform. A silent witness to numerous battles during less peaceful times, the castle now serves primarily as a museum. Aside from the main tower, spread across the castle grounds are 13 structures deemed culturally significant by the Japanese government. Many of these landmarks come with bilingual inscriptions detailing their role in history. The park itself is FREE, but entrance to the Osaka Castle museum and other structures require an entrance fee (JPY 600 for the museum). If traveling by train, the park is most accessible via Osakajokoen Station of the JR Osaka Loop Line.   2. IMPROVE YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AT KIYOMIZU-DERA Kiyumizu Dera If for some reason you only have time to visit one Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Kiyumizu-dera (Pure Water Temple) in Higashiyama-ku, eastern Kyoto should be on top of your options. Founded by the Hosso Buddhist sect in the 8th Century AD, the temple got its name from the clear waterways over which the temple premises were erected. Kiyomizu-dera’s foremost attraction is its Main Hall, a favorite subject among Japanese painters, poets and photographers. Housed within is a statue of the Kannon Bodhisattva, the Buddhist goddess of mercy. Overlooking a panoramic view of Kyoto is the Main Hall’s sizeable veranda, which is supported by 13-meter-high wooden pillars noted for not using a single nail during construction. There was a time when jumping off the veranda was practiced by devotees in a desperate attempt to have their wishes granted by Kannon. It has long since been prohibited, but even today, if a Japanese friend tells you to “to jump off the stage at Kiyomizu”, he means that you take the chance and throw caution to the wind. Otowa Waterfall is another popular venue within the complex, a set of three small water channels that flow to a man-made pond. The three channels represent good health, success in studies, and a fulfilling romance, and drinking from each channel will grant the drinker its respective benefit. Drinking from all three is discouraged, though, as it is considered greedy. Entrance to the Main Hall requires a JPY 400 entrance fee, while the rest of the complex is free.   3. EXPERIENCE THE KYOTO OF YORE IN HIGASHIYAMA DISTRICT Just outside Kiyomizu-dera is Higashiyama District, a quaint little village that would fit nicely in a Kurosawa period film. Many pilgrims pass by this village to get to Kiyomizu-dera, and the road leading up to the temple is lined with mom-and-pop stores, confectionery stands, and teashops. Traveling the two-kilometer, uphill stretch is never dull, not if you have a box of mochi in one hand and some matcha ice cream in the other. Higashiyama District The old-fashioned houses have been serving visitors for centuries, and can be quite festive and jam-packed during holidays. This is especially true during the Hanatoro festival in March, when the shops extend their service hours and the streets are illuminated by thousands of lanterns. Both Kiyomizu-dera and Higashiyama District are a little far-off from the railway network, and your best option to get here is a 15-minute bus ride from Kyoto Station to the Kiyomizu-michi bus stop, followed by a ten-minute walk. Bus tickets start at JPY 230.   4. IMMERSE IN OSAKA’S URBAN CULTURE IN DOTONBORI AND SHINSAIBASHI Originally a theater district, people go to Dotonbori for its cheery nightlife and ample food choices. The variety of neon signboards, entertainment centers, restaurants, and street food kiosks (yatai) within the district are a feast for the senses. Landmarks include the Glico Man giant signboard, with his signature winning pose, the Dotonbori Canal, and the National Bunraku (Puppet) Theater. Delicious street food can be yours for as low as JPY 200 per serving. Have your fill of Osaka staples like okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and kushi katsu. Dotonbori Where Dotonbori is a food lover’s paradise, Shinsaibashi is a haven for shoppers. Shinsaibashi boasts a 600-meter covered stretch full of fashion boutiques, retail outlets, sporting-goods stores and electronic shops. One of the oldest shopping districts in Japan (founded by a Japanese merchant in 1622), Shinsaibashi has something for everyone, from posh designer bags to hundred-yen novelties. Most stores offer duty-free privileges if you have a passport to show. The Dotonbori and Shinsaibashi districts are adjacent to each other, and located within the Chuo-ku ward. They can be reached via a 10-minute walk from the JR Namba Station of the Yamatoji Line.   5. VISIT THE SHRINE OF FOXES AT FUSHIMI-INARI TAISHA Among the dieties of the complex Shinto pantheon, probably the most revered is Inari, the patron of rice, tea, and merchants. One in every three shrines throughout Japan is devoted to Inari, and many business owners – even heads of large corporations – visit these shrines for blessing and guidance. Fushimi-Inari Taisha, located in Kyoto, is Inari’s principal shrine. Fushimi Inari Shrine Located at the foot of a mountain also named Inari, Fushimi-Inari Taisha is well-known for two reasons: the hundreds of vivid red torii gates that cover the walkways leading up to the shrine precincts, and the dozens of stone foxes that guard these shrines. The fox statues, known as kitsune, serve as messengers of Inari, and are frequently portrayed clutching an item significant to the deity, be it a jewel, a scroll, or rice. Those seeking Inari’s blessing bring offerings to kitsune in hopes of gaining their favor. If you feel adventurous, you can hike up the mountain to access the higher precincts and catch an impressive view of the city. The walkways span about four kilometers, and can take a couple of hours to traverse. Back at the entrance, shops offer trinkets, souvenirs, and sweets to bring home. Fushimi-Inari Taisha is free and easily accessible by train: the Inari Station of the JR Nara Line is located just outside the shrine entrance.   6. HONE YOUR POKÉ-TRAINING SKILLS AT POKÉMON CENTER UMEDA Pokemon Center From a concept its creator Satoshi Tajiri derived from insect collecting, Pokémon has since evolved (no pun intended) to a universally-recognized media franchise and lifestyle brand. The mobile game Pokémon GO only added a fresh multitude of dedicated “trainers”, all trying to be the very best, like no one ever was. Any true-blue Pokémon fan visiting Osaka can’t afford to miss the city’s own Pokémon Center, located at the 13th floor of the Daimaru Umeda Department Store within Osaka Station City. Essentially a toy and hobby shop, the Pokémon Center is also a de facto gathering place for Osaka Poké-fans. You can swap Pokémon, trade cards, play arcade games, or simply hang out with fellow enthusiasts. And yes, it has its own Pokémon GO gym, in case you and your Snorlax are confident enough to take on Osaka’s best trainers. It won’t cost anything to drop by Pokémon Center Umeda, but with all those Pikachu plush toys staring at you doe-eyed, the effort to not bring one (or three) back home can get real fast.   7. PAUSE AND MEDITATE AT SHITENNO-JI Shitenno-ji in central Osaka is the oldest Buddhist temple in Japan, founded in 593 AD by the mythical Prince Shotoku. A devout Buddhist at a time when the religion was not prevalent in Japan, Prince Shotoku built the temple in honor of the Shitenno, the four heavenly kings of Buddhism. Shitenno-ji Because of its popularity with devotees, the surrounding areas are always busy with vendors selling food, herbs, and novelty items. However, the hustle and bustle is hushed once you get inside the temple premises. The main attractions here are the Kondo or main hall (where a shrine for the Prince is located), the five-story pagoda, the treasure house, and the Gokuraku-jodo Garden. Carefully landscaped white sand and pebble formations (called karesensui) accentuate the temple and aid visitors in their meditations. Gokuraku-jodo Garden, located at a separate area nearby, was designed based on the Sukhavati, the Buddhist Western Paradise. To get inside the Kondo, the treasure house, or the Gokuraku-jodo Garden, you need to shell out JPY 300 each. Shitenno-ji is a five-minute walk from the Shitennoji-Mae-Yuhigaoka Station via the Tanimachi (Subway) line, or a 10-minute walk from Tennoji Station of the JR Osaka Loop line.   8. GO TEMPLE-HOPPING IN ARASHIYAMA. This iconic district just in the western fringes of the city is a nationally designated Historic Site and Place of Scenic Beauty. When you visit for the first time yet you have that strange feeling that some parts are familiar, don’t freak out. You’ve probably seen it before in paintings or postcards, especially when the area is dressed in the fiery colors of fall. Concealed in its deciduous forests and bamboo groves are temples that are worth a visit including Horinji Temple, one of the five head Shingon Buddhist temples in Kyoto; Tenryuji Temple, the best among the Five Great Zen Temples of Kyoto and a UNESCO World Heritage Site; and Nonomiya Shrine, a Shinto shrine founded around 800 AD. With the exception of Tenryuji Temple which collects a Y500 admission fee, acccess to Arashiyama’s temples are free of charge. Arashiyama Bamboo Forest USEFUL TIPS: Be on the lookout for budget fare promos . As we all know, a huge bulk of one’s travel budget go to airfare. Low-cost carriers like Cebu Pacific regularly offer great deals, allowing budget travelers to focus more on the ‘traveling’ and less on the ‘budget’. Prepare for some serious walking . Bring water, sunscreen, a nice pair of walking shoes, and really comfortable socks. Many of the attractions listed here require a lot of walking, sometimes stretching for kilometers on end, and you don’t want your Japan trip ruined by dehydration or blisters. Don’t be afraid to ask for directions . The Japanese definitely know how to accommodate their visitors, and some even go out of their way to help you out with directions. Major train stations also have their own travel service centers of you need more detailed information about your trip. Google Maps is your best friend . Not only is Google Maps useful for pinpointing specific locations, it also offers the most efficient ways to get there, be it by walking, car, or public transport. It even displays fare prices so you can calculate the costs on the spot. Plus, it’s a great way to discover lesser-known gems tucked in between the more popular spots. Get a digital phrasebook . The phrases “Sumimasen” and “Eigo ga hanaseru”, plus tons of hand gestures, have gotten me out of tight spots more often than I would like to admit. Spare yourself the embarrassment and download some free Japanese digital phrasebooks and practice before the actual trip. Special thanks to our friends from Cebu Pacific for making this trip possible. From Manila, Cebu Pacific flies to Osaka four to five times a week. They also provide flights to Tokyo, Fukuoka, and Nagoya. If you’re staying in Japan for at least 7 days and you’ll be taking long-distance trains a lot, you can save money by getting a Train Pass.

Seven of these trips happened in winter. Our obsession fascination with winter probably stems from the fact that we spent 30 years of our lives in tropical islands. Like many kids who had never seen real snow, we grew up dreaming of white Christmas and winter wonderland! Many of us whose roots are planted near the equator once imagined ourselves in that snow globe we shook dreamily. And that was way before Frozen hit the theaters. Imagine kids these days. (Cue: Do you wanna build a snowman..? ) For us, snow is a reward, something that we could only see if we work hard enough to afford it, after we had been burdened by life’s many responsibilities. While I’m aware that too much of it has a dark side, for the young, naive me, snow is not ice powder but fairy dust, the stuff that magical places are made of. And of all these winter wonderlands, Japan is probably the most accessible. If you want to make your icy dreams come true in Japan, you have to prepare for it. Winter may be dreamy, but it is often harsh and can be unforgiving. Here are some tips!       1. Thermal Underwear It can be challenging to walk around in multiple layers of clothing. The best way to minimize this is by being smart with the pieces you wear. For this reason, purchase thermal underwear. Thermal underwear traps the body heat to insulate the wearer against the cold air outside. It covers your entire body: not just the torso but also the arms and the legs. In Manila, you can find it at UNIQLO or Marks and Spencer branches. At UNIQLO, tights or leggings are somewhere between P790 and P990, long sleeved tops are also within the same range. But if they’re too pricey for you, some stalls at St. Francis Square sell them too. The thing is, it’s much cheaper to buy them in Japan than in the Philippines. For example, the bottom tights or leggings that cost P790 at UNIQLO in Manila, they cost only 790 YEN in Japan. ¥790 is equal to only P350 . That’s less than half of the Manila price. My advice is to buy just one pair before your trip and then buy the rest when you’re already in Japan. UNIQLO and GU stalls have them.   2. Layering I usually just wear four layers when I’m sightseeing. The Base : Thermal underwear. The Mid-layer : Sweater (fleece, wool) and pants (denim). The Outerwear : usually a trench coat, pea coat, or a padded hoodie, depending on my activity for the day. May be wool, fleece, polyester. The Accessories : gloves, scarves, beanie, . Choose an outerwear (jacket, blazer, overcoat) that you can easily take off. In winter, buses, trains, and establishments are well-heated, so no matter how cold it is outside, it can still be pretty warm inside. It can be inconvenient and annoying to take your jacket off and to put it back on over and over again, so choose a piece that you can easily get out of. For cheap finds, visit your suking ukay-ukay. But if you don’t like hand-me-downs, go to SM Surplus Shop, St. Francis Square or Greenhills for off-season garments. Again, it’s cheaper to just purchase outerwear in Japan. By the way, if you want to blend in with the locals, pick clothes that are black, white, gray or neutral. This is especially true in Tokyo. Outside the capital, more colors get more common.   3. Shoes, Socks, and Accessories UNIQLO Products Even winter shoes and accessories are much, much cheaper in Japan. If you don’t own gloves, scarves, beanies, or even ear muffs yet, I suggest that you buy in Japan instead. Shoes . Walking on snow can be dangerous because it can get slippery. Make sure your shoes have a great grip and provide good traction. Boots with non-slip neoprene or rubber is ideal, especially if the soles have grooves. I have tried using only the typical sneakers and gosh, my butt met the ground so many times. (More about walking over snow below.) Socks . Purchase long socks and make sure they look good. In Japan, you’ll have to remove your shoes on multiple occasions like entering temples, shrines, traditional restaurants, and ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) among others. Make sure they are presentable and have no holes. Scarves . While Tokyo locals prefer dark or neutral colors for their clothes, you can be more creative when it comes to accessories. Most scarves are still pretty muted, though. Gloves . Essential in colder months (January/February). Problem with the regular gloves is that it makes using your phone harder. If you feel like you’ll be depending on your smartphone a lot, but those pairs with special tips that can be detected by phones.   4. Sunglasses I always get weird looks from my companions — be it family, friends, or other bloggers — when I put on sunglasses in snowy places. Just because it’s cold and cloudy doesn’t mean the ultraviolet rays are not there. We still need to protect our eyes especially from the UV rays that the snow reflects. Up to 85% of the UV rays from the sun bounce off of snow , and this can lead to a condition called snow blindness . The medical term is photokeratitis (or inflammation of the cornea). So please, don’t forget sunglasses.   5. Sunscreen, Moisturizer and Lip Balm Winter is brutal to the skin too. The cold can leave your skin dry and your lips flaky. Help lock in the moisture by using your trusted moisturizer and lip balm. Sunscreen is also essential even on cloudy days! My sunscreen of choice is BIORE UV AQUA RICH with SPF 50. It’s water-based so it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling. And because it also protects the skin from harmful UV rays, it also doubles as sunscreen. It became available in the Philippines in 2016, but if you can’t find one, you will definitely see it at convenience stores, cosmetic shops, or supermarkets in Japan. It’s a bit ubiquitous in Japan.   6. Meds and Surgical Face Mask The body becomes more vulnerable in winter. The common cold is, well, common. In Japan, people do not wear mask because they’re afraid to catch a cold. They do it because they do not want whatever illness they have to spread to other people. If you have a cold or cough — and it’s easy to catch it in winter — the polite thing to do there is to keep your nose and mouth covered. Masks are available at convenience stores, too. And oh, bring your own meds for common, non-serious illnesses so you don’t have to worry about the language barrier in case you get sick.   7. Heat Pack You know what else is available at convenience stores in Japan? Kairo . Kai-what? For foreigners, kairo is more commonly referred to as a heat pack or pocket warmer . It’s a small package that contains heat-generating powder or liquid that you can attach to your clothing. (Stick it to your clothing, NOT your skin. Avoid skin contact.) It’s perfect for those with low cold-tolerance because it will provide the necessary warmth for around 12 hours.   8. Humidifier in your Hotel Room Many hotel rooms in Japan are equipped with humidifiers in winter. Humidifiers add moisture to the air, which will prevent skin dryness and irritation. It can also relieve dryness of the throat and lips. This can make your stay much more comfortable. Some hotels provide humidifiers for free. Some rent it out. But to be absolutely sure, contact your hotel before your trip or request for one at the reception upon arrival.   9. Hot Drinks from Vendo Another way to battle the cold is having a hot drink. In Japan, you don’t need to walk into a cafe or restaurant to have a cup of hot chocolate, coffee, or tea. Hot drinks are widely available at many vending machines throughout the country. Many first-time travelers in Japan don’t notice them because they’re usually in the same machine as the cold beverages. Hot drinks are often marked RED, while cold drinks like sodas are marked BLUE. (Often. Not always.)   10. Walking on Snow Like I said earlier, walking on snow can be dangerous so take extra care. If it’s your first snow experience, you may feel tempted to step on snow immediately, but you need to figure out which parts are slippery and which parts are safe. Some pointers. If there is a designated walking path, stay on that path . It’s hard to tell what’s underneath the snow sometimes. You might walk straight into a hole. True story. LOL. Seriously though, I once walked right into a hole in the ground because the entire place was covered in snow. This was in Sapporo. If the snow looks dark, wet, compact or icy, it’s probably slippery. Avoid stepping on that. Maintain balance by stretching your arms out to the sides . Don’t put them in your pocket. Having your arms out also gives you better reflex should you slip or fall.   11. Tattoo and Onsen Nothing is more relaxing than taking a hot bath in winter, which is why onsen and sento are very popular throughout Japan. Onsen is hot spring, while sento is public bath that uses regular water. Onsen is generally fancier and more sought after. However, tattoos are banned in most onsen and sento. Although the younger generations are becoming more open to it, tattoos are still generally frowned upon in Japan as a whole. The aversion probably stems from its long history of association with criminality, whether as a punishment or as a symbol for the Japanese mafia. Some onsen places accept guests with tattoo. There are websites that keep a list of these establishments. But in most onsen, you may be asked to leave. Some guests with small tattoos get away with it by using concealers or getting creative, though. If you really want to experience an onsen and you have tattoos, a good alternative is the so-called kashikiri-buro , which is a private bath. You can also stay at a ryokan that offers rooms with private onsen, but these are very luxurious (ergo: expensive).   12. Timing is everything. Sapporo Snow Festival, February Winter may not be as vibrant as the other seasons, but it doesn’t mean it’s boring. Before booking your flight, check the schedule of festivities in your destination. Here are some well-known events. December 23 : Emperor’s Birthday Appearance at Imperial Palace, Tokyo January 1 : Hatsumōde (first Shinto shrine visit), nationwide January Week 1 : New Year SALE, Tokyo and Yokohama January 2 : Emperor’s New Year Greeting at Imperial Palace, Tokyo February : Sapporo Snow Festival (dates vary, early February) Also, winter illuminations are worth checking out. Numerous installations are scattered all over the country. Schedule is often between mid-November to February, some until March. Japan isn’t big on Christmas. Although you can hear Christmas tunes and see decors at commercial spaces, it’s a regular working day. New Year’s Day is a holiday, but don’t expect to see grand fireworks displays. Locals gather at Shinto shrines on New Year’s Eve for hatsumōde, the first shrine or temple visit. If you decide to experience this, know that it will be super crowded and the lines can extend for blocks. In winter, days are shorter, which means you have fewer hours to explore. Establishments also close earlier than usual, so make sure you double check their winter schedule. If you’re into photography, don’t expect to see the sunset at 6pm. The golden hour happens at 4-ish in the afternoon."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2018/01/shirakawa-go-travel-guide/,japan,"SHIRAKAWA-GO ON A BUDGET 2018: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary When I think of Japan, my mind automatically conjures up images of these attractions: Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Mt.

In fact, in 1995 this majestic, picture-perfect village was recognized by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage Site.

It’s one of those places that you would think only exists in fantasy films or your wildest dreams. Every angle of this little hamlet looks like it jumped out straight from a fancy holiday greeting card, especially in winter when the thick snow blankets transform the site into a winter wonderland. In fact, the technique and construction style of the houses combined with the region’s colder climate gave birth to a tradition that has equally become one of the defining characteristics of this cultural heritage treasure — yui . The iconic Gassho -style thatched roof houses can withstand the heavy snowfall during winter. Gassho means “hands in prayer.” The long-standing architectural design brought the villagers together, helping each other in re-thatching the roofs. It’s astonishing how these roofs, constructed sans nails, bound the people of Shirakawa-go together through religiously carrying out the yui tradition. There are still about a hundred of these century-old houses, especially in Ogimachi. Some of them function as museums, inns, or guesthouses. All the traditional houses in Shirakawa-go share these common features — irori (sunken hearth) placed in the center of the living room, 60-degree angle roof inclination, the absence of nails in the construction, and they face the same direction (gable ends facing north and south).

Walking around the village is the best way to explore this world heritage site. You also need to take off your shoes before entering the traditional houses. All houses are private properties. Some are open to the public, but you must keep in mind that the owners still reside in them. Always ask for permission before entering. Don’t smoke just anywhere . There are designated smoking areas. Do not litter. Be responsible, and observe proper garbage disposal. Try doburoku . If you are visiting during Doburoku Festival in autumn, you must at least try it. The people of Shirakawa-go have special permission from the Japanese government to produce home-brewed unrefined sake; elsewhere in Japan. Finding home-brewed alcohol elsewhere in Japan is not easy because the government banned the practice. Be mindful of others. During peak season, Shirakawa-go can get crowded. Don’t take too much time posing for photos to give others a chance to enjoy the views and attractions also. Be polite. If you are using Nihongo to say thank you, don’t just say arigatou , but rather arigatou gozaimasu . The latter is more formal and polite. Sumimasen can mean excuse me or sorry."https://hippie-inheels.com/essential-tips-for-visiting-petra/,jordan,"Essential Tips for Visiting Petra | Exploring a World Wonder! You’ve probably heard of Petra, one of the new wonders of the World and the filming site of many movies (like Indiana Jones)! But a lot of people don’t know what it involves to tour Petra. I wanted to put together some essential tips for visiting Petra so you’re well prepared. The more prepared you are the better the experience will be. These huge sandstone carvings in Wadi Musa are on every traveler’s bucket list. The walkway in called the Siq, is over 660 feet high and keeps you shaded and cool as you walk toward the main sights. My Essential Tips for Visiting Petra! 1. Absolutely do a Petra Tour For many places, I think that exploring on your own is fun and you can read signs as you go through, but at Petra, the Rose City, there were very few signs explaining the history. Without a guide, you won’t know what you’re even looking at. The stories behind the sculptures and carvings are what made it such a special day. Guides can be very inexpensive and if you split the costs with your travel buddies, it’s very well worth it. Have you heard of the Nabataean dynasty? No? Then take a tour for sure! I do recommend reading up on it a little before because you’ll appreciate it even more. Here are a few quick facts: Nabateans made this place is 312 BC UNESCO heritage site Was unknown to the West until 1812! Bedouin tribes kept it secret because they feared people would come treasure hunting in their home. Trade of things like frankincense and myrrh happening here and people passing by had to pay a fee. One of the new 7 wonders of the world ( see the rest here ) No one actually knows what the treasury was for. Moses’ brother Aaron is buried around here at the tip-top of the mountain. These are the first sights you’ll see as you walk into the Siq: 2. Travel to Petra – Amman to Petra, getting there You will want to ask your driver to take the “Kings Highway” which isn’t as fast but is a scenic route that some locals call  Jordan’s Grand Canyon .   The sights were great and we stopped at a few lookout points for photos so add in about 30 minutes. You can also stop at Karak Castle if you go this way. I’ll be posting an itinerary soon! This route is very windy and hilly so don’t take if you get car sick. 3. Consider Petra by Night … but don’t plan your trip around it. Petra by Night is a “performance” at Petra, at night, go figure! Although it was neat to see the lights, we were very tired from our trip and maybe could have given this a skip. So many people loved this experience, like Ashley &amp; Jessica , so definitely do some research before deciding. The performance was good and they pass around tea. I would have preferred to check out Petra town, shop, and eat some street food after dinner and just wait to see Petra in the morning. We went a little late so had no mats to sit on which made it not so fun, but we also had the walk through the lit up Siq all to ourselves. If you want some images, check out the posts linked above because I have no clue how to take night photos! 4. Where to stay in Petra The two great 5 star hotels are the Movenpick &amp; Marriott although the Movenpick is the most famous of the two. It’s just outside the entrance of the site and has a pool! We stayed there and it was cool to know that Ben’s dad also stayed there years ago! For a great but more affordable option, check out Petra Guesthouse . It’s got a more boutique feel and many like that more than a 5 star! If you want something budget, stay at the famous (and cheap) Al Rashid Hotel . DO book ahead for any hotel in Jordan. Don’t just show up. 5. Petra is not just the treasury! The treasury is what you see on all the photos and what you probably have heard of but the Monastery which is a huge walk away is much larger and more impressive. I heard the same thing from others who have been there which is that guides imply it’s not worth going to, which might be because they don’t want to make the walk up. I am here to say it IS worth going to. I wouldn’t have if Ben didn’t want to. He was determined so I went along with it and am so happy we did. The monastery did not use to be open to the public, so it’s great that we are now able to see it. Here is what you’ll see BEYOND the treasury! Colosseum  map via ZigZag 6. Get there early We got there about 9 AM which was a decent time but earlier is more preferable. We saw some people rocking up at 2 PM and felt so bad for them being out in the hot sun. You need 7 hours to walk to the monastery and back. We did it in 5 but we SERIOUSLY speed walked and we took a donkey part of the way up to the monastery (I’ll get to that later). It starts to get really hot around 1 pm so the earlier you go the better, plus there will be fewer people around. this kid above was hilarious. I had my guide ask for a photo of him and we gave him some candy in exchange. For the photo, he chugged his juice box then slammed it to the ground with this huge attitude haha theatrical.  7. Take a donkey up to the monastery… but not like I did I am a huge animal lover but really did feel like this was an okay thing to do. It gives money to the people working there and donkeys are really strong animals that, from what I understand, can walk these steps without issue. The monastery is at the top of 822 very steep and uneven steps. Many people wore hiking shoes and brought a walking stick. I wore silk trousers and my favorite burlap Tom’s  lol. It not only saved time, but we laughed our asses off watching each other try to stay on. They walk really close to the edge of the cliff. It’s so unnerving! Ben is terrified of heights but still loved it. Then, I nearly fell off! I was wearing a tank top with a sweater over it and went braless because I knew it’d be all hot and sweaty out there. I didn’t know I’d be on a bumpy camel ride. As soon as I let go with one hand to hold my chest (because the donkey had started trotting) my silk pants failed me and I started to slip to the left… I just knew I was going down! I yelled out and my left leg sort of tripped the donkey. I couldn’t balance out and was feeling like a bitch for tripping an innocent donkey but the guy who was walking with us (he owned them) pushed me back up and Monica, my dear donkey friend, kept on walking like nothing happened. I think she winked at me like  girl, don’t worry, no one saw.  But let’s be honest, people saw. We paid 5 dinars each for the ride up ($15 USD all together) which was offered to us as we walked by, not negotiated. I did see others pay 10 dinars each for a ride. 8. Save the camel ride for Wadi Rum (unless you aren’t going there) There are camels rides which you could take from the bottom of the monastery back toward the treasury (and you could ride a horse or chariot back from there). If you’re going to Wadi Rum on a camel safari I suggest saving your money and waiting to have this experience in the desert instead of a crowded historic site. The chariot is great if you have difficulty walking and is about $40 dinar each way. Not cheap! 9. Buy the two-day pass Chances are you will go there two days, not just one – after all, you’ve flown all this way! The one-day pass is $70 USD and the two-day is $77 USD. You can read more about the passes here . Tickets come with a free horse ride which is about a 5-minute ride but it’s not actually free because you need to tip 5 dinars (about $7 USD). It looked like fun, but I passed on this. Petra by night is an additional $25 bucks. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. What to wear in Petra Wear comfortable walking shoes! I was fine in Tom’s really and Ben was in flip-flops so this isn’t as major as everyone makes it out to be but yes, of course, hiking shoes would make it easier. This is a Middle Eastern country (duh) and although not as strict as somewhere like Saudi, there are customs you should follow. I wore silk Ali baba pants which were breezy and comfortable. I wore a tank with a long sleeve kaftan (sort of) over it. It had slits in the armpit where you could get a breeze and also take your arms out and make it a tank top kaftan. It was hot, but you should cover up here. I saw girls in mini dresses and jean shorts, so to each their own. Most of what I wore was from the brand Tia . Do NOT forget sunscreen! I am obsessed with Sun Bum Face stick … lifesaver! 11. Bring money You can shop as a few places. There are food and tea stalls (and even free WiFi). I bought my mom a seriously overpriced pice of jewelry because it was  that cute. I can’t say what because I haven’t given it to her yet! Ben got an overpriced coin that may or may not be from ancient times. I try not to be cynical though! We also paid for water, tea, and our donkey rides. Kids are selling post cards as well. this is the famous Rosemary spice shop, definitely make a stop by! You can’t miss it. 12. What I would do differently… Of all my tips for visiting Petra, this is the one I think is most important. As I mentioned I would skip Petra by Night to explore the town. Unfortunately with just 2 or 3 days you end up going from the hotel to Petra and entering the blocked off UNESCO site. There IS a whole town there where people live and work. I wish I could have explored outside the tourist attraction and next time would do so. There was one place outside that we did try, which is my next point. 13. Eat at Qantara This is a popular restaurant owned by the self-proclaimed Arab Al Pacino (lol) and it was very tasty! This was the only thing we did outside of Petra site and the hotel due to time constraints and I loved this meal."https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-for-the-dead-sea-in-jordan/,jordan,"Tips for the Dead Sea in Jordan… a cool &amp; crazy experience! Visiting the Dead Sea is something I’ve always wanted to do and I was lucky to visit this dream destination on my recent trip to Jordan. You can also visit this Sea from Isreal. There were a few things I didn’t know ahead of time so wanted to share some tips for the Dead Sea in Jordan so you can enjoy it to the fullest. Hey, Ash… are there any fish in the dead sea? (me to my tour guide) – (his reply) umm.. no, that’s why it’s called the dead sea.. everything dies.  Right, that makes sense… my bad. I should have Wikipedia’d this place before! lol I knew it was so salty you could float but that’s about it. As I started traveling in Jordan people were talking about the magical mud from the Dead Sea. This didn’t come as a huge surprise because since I can remember there have been Israelis/Jordanians/Palestinians selling Dead Sea Products in the middle of the malls of America in Kiosks. I have tried those products and did like them but never thought that much about it. I also was excited to see what it felt like to float. So, here are my tips for visiting the Dead Sea in Jordan. Tips for the Dead Sea in Jordan Visit SOON before it’s too late Sadly, this sea (which is really a lake) has shrunk by 30% and scientists say we may only have  50 years to float in these healing waters. The water comes from the Jordan River which is also used as drinking water for everyone around. There so far is no solution in sight. Choose the perfect hotel This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for most people. There are dozens of great hotels to choose from but if you can budget out $280 a night you’ll be sleeping in one of the best hotels in the world: the Kempinski Ishtar . Kempinski is one of the most high-end hotel brands in the world and you don’t often find such an incredible hotel at these prices (even in India it’s more at the Leela Kempinski Goa). To put it into perspective, a room like this in Waikiki usually goes for about $700. I wouldn’t suggest splurging out like this on your whole trip to Jordan. Most people visit so many desert and forest places that don’t have luxury options, that this would be your one-time splurge… one that is well worth it! Definitely book ahead for the spa If you stay at the Kempinski, which many people do (it’s HUGE), you need to book ahead for a spa treatment as they fill up. They were voted the best spa in Jordan and for good reason. You can get “Dead Sea mud treatments” all over this region, but here you’re actually at the Dead Sea getting it straight from the source. You actually can just go to the sea and use the mud free of charge, but a treatment would be a heated mud wrap, olive oil or mud facial, and a massage. You luckily can buy this mud at Macy’s, Nordstrom or online here ! AHAVA is the best brand! This wonderful skin-perfecting mud stains! You should wear either an old swimsuit or a black swimsuit. The mud does stain some light-colored fabrics. I wore my TIA one piece bikini because it’s my darkest one. You can wear a bikini, though, it doesn’t have to be a one-piece. Once you’re in a 5-star hotel in Jordan you can dress a little less covered up if you really feel like it and you can drink booze! Most of the hotels are set up along the Dead Sea, so this doesn’t just go for where I stayed, the Kempinski. You can expect that the hotel will provide towels, an outdoor shower, and a little container of mud to dig into. You can’t actually dig down and get the mud yourself because you can’t get this water in your eyes… which leads me to my next point. This water will BURN your eyes and open cuts In fact, you should not even shave the few days before you get in the Dead Sea. Razor burn would be MISERABLE! After about 10 minutes, I started to feel a tingle on my skin so I got out. You shouldn’t stay in more than 15 minutes. The routine for your skin was told to us as: Get in and float 10 minutes. Get out and apply mud. Let the mud dry. Get in for another 10 minutes. Rinse off in the shower. The rinsing off in the shower is the most important bit! The mud actually sticks on so once you back to your room you should wash up again. This mud is well-known to help your skin look like a lasered celebrities skin and is highly recommended. You can’t actually  swim as the water is so thick with salt you are forced to float. Make sure you fall backward into it and not onto your face. The Dead Sea has healing properties… loads of them! People didn’t start coming here because they could float. People came because the water was magical. It’s said to heal all kinds of problems like psoriasis and osteoporosis. There is not only a lot of salt in the water but many other minerals. Along with soaking in mineral rich water, you are very far below sea level (in fact, the lowest point on earth!) so that you aren’t getting the sun rays that will burn you. For that reason it’s a safe place to lay in the sun and let the mud and salt water work their magic. People come from all over the world on medical trips to help their health, while looking for alternative cures. Make time for the River Jordan We really tried but didn’t get the time. I hadn’t realized until I got there that it was where Jesus was baptized. I really wanted to get our friend (and dogsitter) Ryance some water from the river, as well as my brother and his wife. It’s only 20 minutes from the hotel area, plus a 20 minutes shuttle but with their timings (9 AM- 4PM as we were told) it never worked out to make it on time. Later, we found tiny bottles in a shop with water from the River Jordan and bought it, although I have a sneaky suspicion the used similar sales tactics to the man who sold Ben the RayBans Tom Cruise wore in Risky Business."https://hippie-inheels.com/best-luxury-hotels-in-jordan/,jordan,"The Very Best Luxury Hotels in Jordan From riding Arabian horses in Amman to riding in a hot air balloon in the deserts of Wadi Rum , there is no shortage of luxury in Jordan. The country may not be as rich as it’s Gulf neighbors, but it’s luxury options are many if that’s the type of trip you want to take. I was in Jordan for 10 days and stayed in 4-star properties and other unique boutique properties and am going to share the best luxury hotels in Jordan. Getting to Jordan is easy enough. You fly into Amman, which is just outside of the city, about 30 minutes drive. You could go super luxury and use a  private jet hire  into and out of Amman! I recommend hiring a car (I use  rentalcars.com ) rather than taking a taxi unless you have a tour set you up. Most 5 star hotels will arrange airport pick up for you as another option. Many countries are offered a visa on arrival at about 40 Jordanian Dinar (around $60 USD). Get more information on visas here . Also, check out: My 10-day itinerary which has a map with all the highlights of Jordan and how to do it all in under 10 days. Tips on how to dress in Jordan The Best Luxury Hotels in Jordan Intercontinental, Amman Can’t go wrong starting out with this hotel. It’s the oldest 5 star hotel in Amman and you can feel the tradition here. The prices are very low here compared to Intercontinental hotels around the world. The buffet is incredible. As it’s an older hotel, you will notice that the rooms are a little outdated in style. There are two pools and a spa and the location is ideal. Click through here to book . Four Seasons, Amman TipAdvisor reviewers have chosen this as the #1 hotel in Amman and although it doesn’t have the rich history, it is newer and fresher. The hotel is stunning and Four Seasons brand is one of my all time favorites. There is a pool, incredible spa, and it’s just 15 minutes from Old Downtown (which is where you want to sight-see). Click here to book . Kempinski, Dead Sea This is the most luxurious hotel in Jordan! If you are saving up for one splurge out night, this is the place to do it. Brad and Angelina agree, as they stayed in one of their private villas. The spa is the #1 Spa in the country and there are 7 pools! Honestly, one of the coolest hotels I’ve stayed at. The “basic” rooms are HUGE. Click here to book . Crowne Plaza, Dead Sea This hotel is a serious rival for the Dead Sea and actually ranks higher than them on TripAdvisor. Although I will always choose a Kempinski property (the one in Istanbul is amaze-balls), this one is a great option as well and would be my second choice, so check out the prices and compare. Location-wise, it’s just next to the Kempinski.  Click here to book . Movenpick, Petra You won’t visit Jordan without going to Petra I hope! This is the top 5 star hotel in the area, hands down. This hotel is the nicest in the area plus it’s LITERALLY right outside the entrance to Petra. That’s extra ideal for early morning walks there and seeing “Petra by Night”. There is a swimming pool (you can wear bikinis here while in 5 star hotels). The hotel is older, but feels like something very regal. The bar area is absolutely stunning. Click here to book . Marriott, Petra Another great option, although not as awesome as the Movenpick, it’s sometimes cheaper (based on searches I’ve just down) so definitely worth your consideration. It’s a 5 star and has  fantastic  views! You won’t have that Movenpick service and charm, but Marriott is always a good brand.  Click here to book . Ma’in Hot Springs Resort, Ma’in This is a no-brainer option for visiting the Ma’in hot springs . There are no other luxury options in the area and this hotel is out of this world. The wooden and natural decor is how I want my house one day! The swimming pools are full or hot water which is rushing down from natural waterfalls into the pool- a nice free back massage. The spa was the bomb. Definitely go for the dead sea mud wrap and massage. You can use the spa pool as well which is really neat and quiet. The food is also the best we had in the hotels in Jordan. Click here to book . Kempinski, Aqaba Aqaba is the coastal beach hotspot here and on most tourists itinerary. Maybe you’ve noticed I love Kempinski hotels, but overall in all of Jordan this hotel won the TripAdvisor best hotel in Jordan. I sadly didn’t make it this far South, but when I do go back, this is 100% where I’ll stay. It looks like amazing modern architecture and pools, right next to the ocean. Click here to book . More hotels in Jordan… You may be curious why there aren’t hotels listed for the other popular options like Wadi Rum, Dana Nature Park, and Ajloun. The reason is what’s available, although very cute and fun to stay at, are not luxury options. They are tents, camping, and eco-lodges. For this reason, many people make day trips to these areas from other places. I also didn’t find any “boutique” style hotels and options here so if you want luxury go for 5 star!"https://hippie-inheels.com/perfect-10-day-jordan-itinerary-let-adventure-begin/,jordan,"Perfect 10 Day Jordan Itinerary, Let the Adventure Begin! Jordan was truly the trip of a lifetime! There are multiple places in Jordan that are on your bucket list . This Jordan itinerary could be done in 7-15 days but I put 10 just for ease of the title – as it’s really up to you how you want to travel. As you can see on the map below, all the ducks are in a row, so to speak. The airport is in Amman in the middle so you need to cover the North than the South or vice versa. I’ll help with that in the Jordan itinerary below. Please scroll up to this map and zoom in to see places I talk about below. In some instance, I tagged hotels as the actual city name did not populate, but it’s obvious which are which. I hope this sample Jordan itinerary can help you plan and keep in mind joining a tour ahead of time is advisable if you are not comfortable renting a car, which you can do from the airport. Also below for most places I have a link to my blog post on tips for each place, so I won’t go into detail here. Views from the road: Turn on your JavaScript to view content the countries’ flower, black iris You may even choose to skip the North entirely, as most major sites are in the South and it would save a lot of time in the car. For reference, you can drive from the most Northern star on this map, Um Qais, to the most Southern, Aqaba, in 5-6 hours with no traffic if you take the main Highway. I suggest the Kings Highway for parts which are slower but shows the “Grand Canyon of Jordan” with fantastic views through winding hilly roads, in the photos just above. Jordan Itinerary Sample: 10 Days Amman Turn on your JavaScript to view content Amman International airport is where you will fly in therefore you have to be in Amman. It is worth seeing. The citadel and Roman theater and amazing ruins and I enjoyed seeing trendy Rainbow street. I stayed a t the most famous, and oldest hotel, the Intercontinental . Check out my blog post on things to do in Amman  and see the best tour options as well. From here if you want to take the time to go North, the spots to visit are Um Qais, Ajloun, and Jerash. You can read about these places and decide and if not skip ahead to the South starting at Amman to Karak Castle. Um Qais Turn on your JavaScript to view content So what’s worth visiting here? More ruins! There are some amazing Greek ruins to explore. At the top, there is a delicious (seriously) restaurant Um Qais Resthouse, a Romero restaurant, which while we were there we saw the King’s Uncle eating at. Very cool. From the top when you look out you interestingly see both Isreal and Syria. Even cooler, you can see the “Sea of Galilee” where Jesus  walked on water! I thought that was just amazing. It was my first time seeing biblical references (that I can remember). Ajloun Ajloun is a great place for nature lovers and is where you could stay the night after seeing Um Qais. We stayed at the Aljoun Eco Lodge  which was peaceful, clean, and quiet. We heard animals all through the night. Food is served in the lodge buffet style. Here you can take hikes and although we only stayed the night you could spend time here bird-watching. There is a castle here as well. Jerash (Jarash) Jerash is one of the two places on this list I did not visit due to time. These are also famous ruins and if I could go back I would see them. In my opinion, if you’ve been to Athens and Rome, then you don’t need to see all the ruins in Jordan you can pick and choose. These are quite famous, though. The ruins had been covered because of an earthquake and were only found in 1806. In photos, the hippodrome and theater look impressive! Now drive back down past Amman to the South. Karak Castle (Kerak) If you fancy seeing this castle, now would be a great time to do it. This is a larger crusader castle that was built in 1140. From wiki : Because of its position east of the Dead Sea, Karak was able to control Bedouin herders as well as the trade routes from Damascus to Egypt and Mecca. It is quite impressive, but unless you have a guide to tell stories (which is what makes it special) you may find it underwhelming. We ate lunch here and it was delicious! Dana Nature Reserve Turn on your JavaScript to view content Dana is another nature-lovers’ place and we stayed at the Dana Rummana campsite . I’m in two minds about the place because the tents are not waterproof, nor is the dining area and we were there in a thunderstorm. I think on a sunny day if you like camping, then this is a beautiful option for you. I think if you are a hotel-type traveler you might want to just see Dana passing through – or if you’ve been to Ajloun, give it a skip. The views were stunning. We ended up asking to leave and go to their nearby guesthouse which was a good option, as that evening the remaining group of Italians there came in drenched around midnight- they had to leave their luggage behind and wait for someone to bring it separately as they woke up with flooded tents. Great idea of a place, but not perfectly executed. The staff was so nice though and the campfire and tea were lovely. The guesthouse, unfortunately, I don’t know the name was the same company and was very cozy! It has some reviews from people saying it was their favorite part of Jordan and others that had not so great experiences. Check them out in the link above and keep in mind tents are a little less than $100. More photos from Dana: Petra Petra, one of the new wonders of the world and the #1 reason people visit Jordan. Obviously, you CANNOT miss Petra while you are here. I have written an extensive amount of tips which you can read here. We stayed at the awesome Movenpick which I highly suggest. It is literally at the doorsteps of the entrance to Petra and it has a pool. 5 stars in Jordan are relatively affordable. Wadi Rum Turn on your JavaScript to view content Again, I have written all about Wadi Rum (the most popular desert destination). I did hot air ballooning here, stayed at a campsite I don’t recommend, and rode a camel! There’s a lot to do here but many people choose to stay just for the day. Please read up on my article on Wadi Rum for full advice on this. Aqaba The second and last town on this list that I did not get to visit while in Jordan was Aqaba which is the popular coastal vacation spot and where you can scuba dive in the famous Red Sea. Ben was really looking forward to going here but it just didn’t work out this time. I definitely would go here if I was given a second chance! I would actually skip seeing the North of Amman in exchange for going here. Wadi Rum, Petra, and Aqaba are sometimes called the tourists “Golden triangle”. Read all about it here . Ma’in Ma’in is the home of amazing hot springs (and I mean, HOT!) and huge waterfalls that drop the hot water on your back for a massage! We stayed at the fantastic Ma’in Resort . I wrote all about the resort and spa in a blog post of it’s own which you should check out – but definitely don’t skip Ma’in. It was Ben’s favorite other than Petra and he doesn’t even like spas. Dead Sea Turn on your JavaScript to view content The Dead Sea is, after Petra, the next biggest tourist attraction for outsiders! I loved seeing it; it’s been on my bucket list since I can remember. I wrote all about it with SO many tips and a look at our hotel, the Kempinski , which was amazing. Head back to Amman to fly home! Some tips for booking your Jordan trip: I search kiwi.com first for flights. Make sure to get travel insurance. I use World Nomads . You can rent a car, hire a driver, or take a tour. I use rentalcars.com  when I rent. Roads are great here. You will get your visa on arrival. You’ll want to pre-book hotels here. I have info on all the places I stayed in my articles on each city I went in Jordan. The Top Tour Options to Cover a Similar Jordan Itinerary It can seem like a lot to plan a trip like this from scratch and I had the help of the tourism board, who gave me a driver. You can rent a car and do the trip yourself (the roads are very good) or you can book a tour with a driver. I use Get Your Guide and Viator when I book day tours and tend to look at G Adventures for longer tours like this, but I compared them all. Keep in mind, G Adventures tours are run by them while the others are outsourced to anyone who wants to add a tour there – so that is why G Adventures is so mugh higher in price. I am going to link the highest rated tours here with the price and where to read more information and book it. 8-Day Highlight of Jordan tour from G Adventures. Book it here for $999 . This tour covers all the big highlights (for real) and also goes down to Aqaba. You go by private car and hotels are included. It’s actually a really good price. You can look at their other tours as they have one focused on adventure in the same price range. 3-Night Jordan tour to Amman, Petra, Wadi Rum, and the Dead Sea from Viator. Book it here for $456 . This tour has the same inclusions for the most part but open them up and compare. It comes down to how much time you have and if you want to see everything or just these key places in the 3-day tour. I hope that this Jordan itinerary can help you plan out your trip.

A Luxury Guide to Nairobi Tell us a little about  yourself and why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Nairobi. I first visited Nairobi, Kenya way back in 2002. I was only a few years out of college, and had just been hired as the North American Marketing Manager for the Kenya Tourist Board. I’d never even been to Africa! After a few fast-paced trips to familiarize myself with Kenya, I fell deeply in love with East Africa. Since then, I’ve been a travel marketer promoting travel to sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years I’ve spent a ton of time in Nairobi, largely because it’s the main hub of tourism in East Africa. What makes Nairobi a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? I’ve always loved the way the air smells in Nairobi. It’s very organic, with scents of the earth. Sidewalks are well-worn footpaths of red soil. Vendors sell produce and flowers from small wooden stalls. There are a few great restaurants in Nairobi, some of which had been around since the colonial days, and a hand full of high-end hotels that cater to safari tourists. And none of this has really changed. Travelers seeking an authentic Out of Africa luxury safari experience won’t be disappointed in Kenya. But at the same time, Nairobi isn’t the same city it was a decade ago. Thanks to technology and plenty of jobs for a newly educated middle class, Nairobi has boomed. In addition to these romantic, historic hotels and restaurants in Nairobi, there are several new chic, urban hotels and restaurants if travelers prefer a more modern African experience. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? No visit to Kenya is complete without a safari experience. If you don’t have time to visit one of Kenya’s renown national parks or private wildlife reserves, Nairobi Tented Camp in Nairobi National Park is a perfect option. Enjoy a game drive with a professional safari guide in a Land Cruiser. Spot the big 5, including elephant, lion, rhino, leopard and Cape Buffalo. Then, enjoy a 4-course meal under canvas followed by bed in a luxury safari tent. This is where “glamping” was invented! If you prefer a more urban African experience, stay in the new Dusit hotel . The rooms, including a sleeping room, separate dressing area and a massive bathroom, are lovely and modern. The restaurant offers something for every palate, and the lobby bar is perhaps the best in the city. Prior to opening early in 2014, the bartenders all spend 6 weeks in a intensive mixology course, and create drinks with the most care and attention to detail. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? One of the most fun and rewarding experiences in Nairobi is visiting the Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage . This organization rescues baby elephants in the wild, and brings them back to a facility in Nairobi National Park where professional caretakers nurse them back to health and raise them until they are old enough to be released back into the wild. There is an hour-long viewing open to the public every morning, but if you adopt an elephant (for as little as US$50) you can attend a private viewing in the early evening and watch while the caretakers get the baby elephants ready for bed. This is a must-see while in Nairobi! Where are the best hang outs during the day?  Nairobi has a really fun coffee shop culture. On any given day, you’ll find locals, expats and tourists congregating at coffee shops around Nairobi. This should come as no surprise, as some of the world’s best coffee is grown right in Kenya. At one time, the bulk of the best coffee was solely produced for export. However, today, Kenyans have come to appreciate high quality coffee. You’ll find a number of Java House restaurants around the city. Enjoy free wifi, a great menu of pastries, sandwiches and salads, in a fun atmosphere. I love the Java House located at The Junction Mall just off Ngong Road near Karen. Don’t be surprised to see young Kenyans typing away on their Macbook Air computers while plotting their tech startup with friends. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? Shopping in Nairobi can be a bit tricky. Most Nairobi residents do most of their shopping in South Africa or Europe. However, if you’re looking to pick up something special and unique from Nairobi, don’t miss the numerous boutiques in the Karen neighborhood of Nairobi."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-riga/,latvia,"Luxury Guide to Riga Welcome to Backpacker’s Boutique.

A Luxury Guide to Riga Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Riga. I’m Anita, a traveler from Latvia. Though mainly a budget traveler, I doesn’t swear off splurging from time to time… I have lived in Riga since 1999 so you could say the city has no secrets from me! I have been to many luxury places here over the years. What makes Riga a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Firstly, believe me when I tell you that Riga is an astonishingly beautiful city. Or better still – don’t believe me and go check for yourself! Secondly, it’s a city inhabited by people with great taste, which just shines through in its architecture, interiors, gardens, parks… In cultural events, too. Riga is renowned for exceptional customer care and a wide choice of activities to accommodate a variety of interests. Furthermore, Riga is not extremely busy or noisy, allowing you to relax in comfort. What 5-star hotel is the best in Riga? It’s hard to pick just one, but if I have to, I’ll go with the Hotel Bergs . Located in a quiet passage of central Riga, at a walking distance from the Old Town,  it’s an excellent property with high standards of service and facilities. Everything is perfect, from the friendly welcome at the check-in to the immaculately clean spacious rooms and the absolutely delicious breakfast. What about boutique hotels in Riga, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Dome Hotel occupies an ideal spot close to numerous chief attractions of Riga, including the Old Town and the Art Nouveau area. It’s your classic big chain hotel, yet with a far more personal feel. The rooms are cozy and quiet, have wooden floors, modern bathrooms with comfy bathrobes, a Nespresso machine, complimentary water and a good night chocolate. The breakfast is a piece of art, delicious, freshly made. The hotel’s 5 stars are well-deserved indeed! Make sure to visit the sauna on the top floor with a truly amazing view over the city. Another highlight of the place is the restaurant, serving excellent fish dishes. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Riga? Plenty, both in Riga and nearby. The two most unusual ones are practiced in the town of Sigulda, just 30 kilometers from Riga: bobsleigh rides and Aerodium flights. Aerodium is a vertical wind tunnel letting you get a bird’s eye view of the world thanks to a powerful air stream. The Aerodium athletes have already showcased their skills at the Torino 2006 Winter Olympics and at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, and now this breathtaking experience is yours to have! As for the bobsleigh tracks, there are fewer than 20 in the whole world, and only a handful in public usage, so Sigulda rides are a unique chance! There are two types of them: the rookie ride called Vucko, or “the soft bob”, and “the real bob”. The latter can speed up to nearly 130 km/h and costs 50 Euros while Vucko keeps it at around 80 km/h and costs 10-15 Euros. You don’t have to book, but the pro version is only available at certain times.  For a close-to-nature summer experience, kick your confining shoes and walk 2,6 kilometers barefoot on a variety of surfaces at a country resort called “ Valguma Pasaule ”, 60 kilometers from Riga. If sailing is your thing, you can rent the yacht “Hugo”, currently the most ultramodern yacht in Latvia. Proud holder of the “European Boat of the Year 2010” award, it can accommodate a maximum of 10 people for a one-day voyage at 1100 Euros on weekends. Where are the best hangouts during the day in Riga? I would recommend the Old Town Walking Tour, I really think it captures the real essence of Riga. An extremely friendly and knowledgeable local guide Zane Šūpulniece will show you all the main sights and share exciting stories about the city’s past. I’d say this excursion is a great appetizer, making you hungry for further discoveries! But if you’re pressed for time and want to make the most of it, choose the Segway Tour with Zane. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Riga and what are their best dishes? There are countless options again but I would especially recommend the library-style restaurant called Biblioteka 1. The interior really makes you feel like you’re seated in the safety and comfort of your own home! You can choose a 9 course tasting menu for 60 Euros or just the main courses for 30 Euros – quite pricy for Riga but cheap by the overall European standards. The introduction of the courses is great: each one comes with a little story and a presentational gimmick. To be enjoyed at Tērbatas iela 2. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Riga; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Of all the local designers I would like to give credit to Amoralle, a luxury brand of prêt à porter loungewear and lingerie: underwear, nightgowns, corsets, bodies, stockings, socks… The company is based in Riga, and all garments are locally produced, from the initial concept to the final product. Silk and chiffon are combined with lace, velvet, crystal and pearl embroidery. All the items are handmade! At the moment there are 20 Amoralle outlets in countries like Great Britain, Australia, Germany, Australia, France, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Russia, and the USA. The Riga’s shop is located at Brīvības iela 33. What is the best salon and spa in Riga? In my opinion, ESPA Riga is one of the best – six floors of superb facilities, luxury comfort, dedicated attention and fantastic treatments. The ground floor is taken up by an 18 meter indoor pool; the 2nd floor has a great gym with the latest Technogym equipment. The SPA itself starts on the 3rd floor where they give you a towel, a quality bathrobe and a pair of slippers. The changing rooms and showers are all of the same luxurious kind, of course. Saunas and steam rooms occupy the 6th floor. The SPA’s unique feature is the heated outdoor pool with salted water, jet sprays and a Jacuzzi. At about 4°C outside, it’s a real treat! There are two large relaxation rooms with individual music selection and soft comfortable sofas to wait for your massage. The massage is very professionally done, and you get several oils and types of massage to choose from. The final accord is another session in a relaxation room with some snacks. Time for a great sunset view in Riga… where would you go? I’d definitely go to the seaside in the town of Jurmala, 25 kilometers from Riga. Besides that great sunset view, you’d also enjoy a walk on a first-rate white sand beach. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Take the chance to combine nice cocktails with a magnificent view across the city in the Skyline Bar on the 26th floor of the Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija, at Elizabetes iela 55. Another great option is the cozy Star Lounge Bar on the upper floor of the Albert Hotel Riga at Dzirnavu Street 33, a perfect place for more glorious views over Riga’s parks and Art Nouveau architecture. If you end the night at a fancy club in Riga, which one do you head towards? After a great dinner at that Biblioteka 1 restaurant I mentioned, you can hit the “Coyote Fly” night club right next door. Powered by the best DJs and VJs from Latvia and abroad, it attracts more than 4500 party-goers a week! Including both the most experienced revelers of Riga and such celebrities as Xzibit, Eve, Dizzee Rascal, Tony Hawks, Jon Olsson, The Dudesons, and many others. The interior is both modern and inspired by the primeval grandeur of Riga’s Vērmanes Garden, while the layout and the acoustics of the concert hall ensure excellent visibility and sound."https://hippie-inheels.com/10-things-to-see-and-do-in-luxembourg/,luxembourg,"10 Things to See and Do in Luxembourg! Luxembourg is a beautiful blend of old meets new. Quirky meets curious and vintage meets modern in this central European country. If you’re visiting for the first time (or even the hundredth), here are the ten very best things to see and do in Luxembourg: Things to See and Do In Luxembourg City: See the Grand Ducal Palace Rather than a King, Queen or President, Luxembourg has a Grand Duke, meaning that Luxembourg is the only remaining Grand Duchy of its kind in the world. A few centuries ago, Grand Duchies were much more common, and the majority were focused in the area in which Luxembourg is situated. The Grand Duke has one official residence in Luxembourg City itself, and it’s well worth a peek. From July through to September, there are daily guided tours of the Palace if you want to see inside… Eat at the Place d’Armes Located in the very center of the city, not far from the Grand Ducal Palace, you’ll find Place d’Armes. This is the focal point and center of the newer parts of the city. It’s where you’ll find live music concerts in the summer (I saw an orchestra playing while eating my dinner one evening) and plenty of outdoor cafés and restaurants to eat at. Wander through the Grund As the oldest part of the city, it should come as no surprise that much of the Grund is listed as a historic place of interest. Many of the buildings and fortifications in this area of the city are actually UNESCO world heritage sites, making them well worth a wander around! Check out the Kirchberg District Luxembourg is home to some parts of the European Union (it is one of the founding members, after all). In the Kirchberg district of the city, you’ll find all of the EU buildings, as well as countless museums. Visit the Bock Casemates Of all the things to see and do in Luxembourg listed here, if you want to get a  real  feel for the history of the city and country, this is where you should visit! These ancient tunnels were quite literally hewn out of the rock on which the newer parts of Luxembourg are built. The temperature in these tunnels remains much the same throughout the year (that is to say, it was fairly chilly in the tunnels which was a welcome relief from the sweltering summer heat outside). In total, 17 kilometers of tunnels remain and are well worth a visit. A trip inside these medieval tunnels and fortifications is free with a Visit Luxembourg Card and the tunnels are open on a daily basis throughout the Spring, Summer and Autumn seasons. See one of the many museums the city has to offer From the National Museum of History and Art to the Villa Vauban (housing the city’s art collection) Luxembourg is rich in culture and has a surprising number of museums for a city numbering just over 120,000. In total, there are seven museums to see and enjoy, all conveniently located along a mile stretch known as ‘Museums Mile’. Enjoy a coffee in one of the many cafés dotted around Luxembourg City Café culture is alive and well in Luxembourg’s capital (and indeed beyond it). As such, there are plenty of cute little cafés, brasseries, and restaurants where you can enjoy one of the many blends on offer. Wander the narrow streets and experience an offbeat side to Luxembourg filled with patisseries and good coffee. Things to do outside of Luxembourg City: No trip to Luxembourg would be complete without at least one venture out into the countryside. From amazing hiking trails, you fairy tale like Castles, there’s no shortage of things to see and do in the country. Plus, as the country is quite small, it’s easy to pack multiple activities (like castle visits) into a single day trip from the city. After all, a drive from North to South of the country takes no more than a few hours… Visit the Castles of Beaufort Whether you’re more interested in Renaissance furniture, or if you prefer wandering around castle ruins, Beaufort has you covered. For, in the little town of Beaufort (Luxembourgish: Beefort), you’ll find a 17th-Century Renaissance Château and the remains of a medieval Castle. Both are well worth a visit, though the Renaissance House can be seen by guided tour only. See the Family of Man Situated in the picturesque town of Clervaux, you’ll find a grand restored Castle. It is here, within the thick walls of this castle that you’ll find a variety of museums houses. There’s a museum dedicated to models (small scale models of the castles of Luxembourg), a museum dedicated to the battle of Ardenne, and the Family of Man. Whether you’re a photographer, or just enjoy seeing fine photography, a visit to the Family of Man is a must-see. The collection of images and photographs from all over the world was carefully curated by the Director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in the 1950s. The Museum highlights the values that bind us as humans, no matter where we come from. Visit Echternach As the oldest settlement in Luxembourg, it should come as no surprise that the adorable town of Echternach is rich in history and things to do. From the remains of the Roman Villa located a thirty-minute walk outside the city to seeing the abbey that founded the country, you’re sure to find something you like!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2012/08/sights-and-sounds-of-kuala-lumpur/,malaysia,"Sights and Sounds of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Kuala Lumpur is Malaysia’s capital city. It is the main economic and cultural centre of Malaysia, home to both the House of Parliament and the Istana Negara (or National Palace). Malaysia itself is a multicultural melting- pot of different ethnic groups and cultures. As the cultural and tourist capital of this diverse country, Kuala Lumpur draws tourists from across the globe. As a result, it is one of the most visited cities in the world with almost nine million tourists visiting per year. You can arrive in Kuala Lumpur via one of two international airports: the KLLCCT or the KLIA. On arrival, there is an airport bus and rail link to the city and travel time is quite speedy.       Central districts which are popular to stay in include the old town and the ‘golden triangle’, a business district with exclusive hotels, and the famous Petronas Twin Towers . The diverse cultures that make up Kuala Lumpur ensure that there is an amazing variety of ethnic cuisine on offer throughout the city. The Chow Kit district near the Twin Towers is an excellent shopping area and the Kampung Baru food market is deservedly famous. The area is an amalgamation of traditional villages and it holds a nightly food market on Saturday evenings. The visitor can walk through miles of stalls of ethnic food served buffet style. Here, you can grab a plate of meats, seafood, mixed rice dishes and rojak salads, while sauntering through colorful market displays. It is one of the best ways to get an immediate sense of the ethnic and cultural diversity of Kuala Lumpur. Petronas Twin Towers The Petronas Twin Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world, making them Kuala Lumpar’s most famous tourist attraction. The steel and glass façade of the towers loom over the city; they are particularly impressive at night, and even more so at sunset. There is an entrance fee and advance booking is necessary to gain admittance. However, it is worth it to view the city from the tower’s sky-bridge and observation points. Walk along the sky-bridge and you are literally walking above Kuala Lumpar, in the evening you can see the lights of the city spread below. Visit Chinatown and you will get a sense of the religious diversity of Kuala Lumpur: mosques, temples and churches almost brush against one another. The visitor to Kuala Lumpar should also ensure that they don’t miss a visit to the Islamic Arts Museum. Within its stunning dome architecture are numerous Islamic artefacts, art works in porcelain, works of pottery and texts. The Islamic Arts Museum holds one of the world’s principle collections of Islamic art and is a noteworthy destination to include in your itinerary. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2011/10/petronas-towers-suria-klcc-kuala-lumpur-singapore-cruise/,malaysia,"Petronas Twin Towers and Suria KLCC: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Earlier that day, when our Tour Guide announced that we had entered the city of Kuala Lumpur, I quickly moved to a window seat and started searching the skies for an imposing structure — the Petronas Towers. When I looked at our itinerary before this trip, I was familiar with these twin towers only. Prior to this trip, I had not heard of the Thean Hou Temple or the Merdeka Square. The Petronas Towers, I have to admit, were the only man-made structure in Malaysia that I was familiar with. That’s why I was really excited when it was finally time to visit this iconic landmark.       Also known as Menara Berkembar Petronas in local language, the Petronas Twin Towers held the record as the world’s tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. The twins lost the title to Taipei 101 in Taiwan but they remain the tallest twin buildings, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) official rankings. The towers were designed by Cesar Pelli, an Argentine architect; Deejay Cerico, a Filipino-Malaysian engineer; and Dominic Saibo, another Filipino designer. The seven-year construction of these twin giants wrapped up in 1998. When we hopped out of our tour bus, we were led to the lobby of the towers. Briefly, we gathered and listened to some last minute reminders by our Guide. We agreed to spend the next two hours within the complex and return to the lobby after. Since it was almost noon, we headed straight to a food court at Suria KLCC. Petronas Twin Towers: Kuala Lumpur's imposing twin giants The Malaysian flag displayed proudly near the entrance; the facade of the Petronas Towers; the ceiling at the main lobby. Widely regarded as the country’s premier shopping destination, Suria KLCC is located at the base of the Petronas Towers, occupying 6 levels. The shopping center formally opened on August 31, 1999. Upon setting foot on the place, I was reminded of Glorietta and Trinoma. I don’t know why but it had that “Ayala Mall” atmosphere. From where we stood, we could see several delightful stores including Books Kinokuniya. There are a number of gadget stores, department stores, fashion boutiques, and restaurants. There was also a supermarket and a cinema complex. Suria KLCC, a shopping complex at the base of the Petronas Twin Towers We were told that there’s a park at the base of the tower with walking and jogging trails, playgrounds, and pools. Unfortunately, our very limited time did not permit us to explore or even see it. When we returned to the lobby, we were also told by our Guide that next time we come to Kuala Lumpur, we should try the SkyBridge between the two buildings on the 41st-42nd levels. Yes, maybe next time."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2012/08/sri-poyyatha-vinayagar-moorthi-temple-malacca-malaysia/,malaysia,"Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple in Malacca: Malaysia’s Oldest Hindu Temple I had never been inside a Hindu temple. I had seen a number of Hindu temples before: in Singapore , in Penang, in Kuala Lumpur. But I had never been inside one. I only had a chance to stand outside with my head tilted and my mouth open as I admired the facade and overall architecture. When I learned that there’s one along Harmony Street in Malacca, I got so thrilled thinking that the time had come that I get to step into a place of worship for one of the oldest religions in the world. I thought it was my lucky day! And lucky day it was not!       The Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple was closed when we visited. Poor me, indeed. Once again, I was an outside lover. Built in 1781, the Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple (sometimes referred to as simply Sri Poyyatha Temple) is said to be the oldest Hindu Temple in Malaysia. This 230-year old structure stands at the heart of the old town of Malacca, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is located in Malacca Chinatown, specifically in Jalan Tukang Emas, which is part of what many tourists aptly call Harmony Street, because it harbors a number places of worships belonging to different religions — the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple (Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism), the Xiang Lin Si Temple (Buddhism), and Kampung Kling Mosque (Islam). The rectangular land where it stands was donated by Kapitan Thaivanayagam Chitty, the head of the community. It was built for the Hindu population of the area to practice their religion, especially the veneration of Lord Vinayagar (also known as Lord Ganesha), a deity with the head of an elephant, body of a man, and four arms. According to the website of  Sri Ruthra Kaliamman Temple  (a Hindu Temple in Singapore):  Vinayagar is both the Lord of obstacles as well as the Remover of obstacles. When we do evil things or when the time is not right, He places obstacles in our path. When we take the correct path, He removes the root of our troubles. Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple, Malaysia’s oldest Hindu temple While its bright yellow-painted facade makes it very hard to miss if you’re walking down Harmony Street (Temple Street), I still kind of missed it. (I really am visually-challenged when the sun is too bright. Or maybe I’m just stupid sometimes. Sometimes is the keyword there.) Perhaps, I was just expecting a temple of Dravidian architecture with a colossal gopuram (dome/tower) covered with rich, colorful, intricately designed ornamentation. While it doesn’t have a massive, overwhelmingly embellished crown, the structure is topped with a three-leveled tower with blue molded edges and arch niches with relief images. Each of the columns of this peak tower has a triangular hole-accents at its center as with the perpendicular base where a line of triangles run horizontally. Sculptures of sacred cows also adorn the fenced rooftop of the temple. The temple is separated from the street by a set of brown picket fences. Since it was built during the period when the Dutch ruled the city, there are also some dutch elements and influences in the design of the temple such as the details of the roofs, vaulted domes, walls, and columns. Well, that’s what’s outside the temple. What’s inside? Maybe another day. When I finally get that opportunity to enter it. "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2012/08/harmony-temple-street-walking-tour-malacca-malaysia/,malaysia,"Walking in Harmony: 4 Religious Places to Visit at Temple Street, Malacca, Malaysia The street is known by many names. Locals have three names for this long road, one for each segment: Jalan Tukang Emas, Jalan Tukang Besi, and Jalan Tokong. Why they have to “divide” the street and give it three names is quite beyond me, but it really is just one long, curved street. Tourists usually call it “Temple Street” because of the number of temples that stand on its edges. But my favorite among all its names —  Harmony .       It was our second day in Malacca. It was also our last day, which was quite unfortunate because we have not really seen much of the city other than Jonker, the Dutch Square, and the Museum Complex. In a matter of hours, we would be flouncing out of Melaka. Our scamper along the street slowly turned into a stroll as soon as we noticed the beauty that surrounded us. Harmony Street is flanked with old buildings that have been converted into Chinese shops. It’s not difficult to see why this historically and culturally important place is dubbed “Harmony Street.” A number of places of worship abound in the area, and they belong to different religions — the major religions in Malaysia. They are the Kampung Kling Mosque (Islam),  Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple (Hinduism),  Cheng Hoon Teng Temple (Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism), and  Xiang Lin Si Temple (Buddhism). Harmony Street is a gigantic testament to religious pluralism in Malacca, which is absolutely admirable. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Kampung Kling Mosque 2. Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple 3. Cheng Hoon Teng Temple 4. Xiang Lin Si Temple Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Kampung Kling Mosque Kampung Kling Mosque gate at Harmony Street and the pagoda-like masonry minaret Built in 1748, Kampung Kling Mosque is one of the remnants of a Muslim Indian village that once occupied the area. In the 18th century, the area was called Kampung Kling. Kampung literally means village and Klings are what natives called the Muslim Indians originating from South India. (I’m not sure if the etymology of the word Kling has something to do with the term Keling, which is considered offensive nowadays. If so, I don’t think it was offensive at the time the mosque was built.) The mosque is almost concealed by a wall, built far later on, but the structure becomes noticeable because of a towering minaret that kind of looks like the Chinese pagoda. 2. Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple, Malaysia’s oldest Hindu temple Unfortunately, the Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple was closed when we passed by. This Hindu Temple was built in honor of Vinayagar, a deity worshipped not just in Hinduism but also venerated in other religions, too. According to the website of Sri Ruthra Kaliamman Temple (a Hindu Temple in Singapore):  Vinayagar is both the Lord of obstacles as well as the Remover of obstacles. When we do evil things or when the time is not right, He places obstacles in our path. When we take the correct path, He removes the root of our troubles. 3. Cheng Hoon Teng Temple A monk leads a single-file procession Of the four temples along Temple Street, the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple is definitely my favorite. It is probably the biggest, the most eye-catching, the most richly decorated and the most intricately designed. Plus, I got to see locals pray and worship while we were there. Locals, led by monks, gathered together for prayer. It actually felt weird to stand there while they worship but they said it was alright as they were used to tourists walking around the site. The Cheng Hoon Teng Temple practices the Three Doctrinal Systems of Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism and was the primary place of worship for the Hoklo (Hokkien) population in Malacca. It was erected in 1645 by Lee Wei King, a Kapitan, using materials from China. 4. Xiang Lin Si Temple The second level of Xiang Lin Si Temple, Malacca Unlike its neighbor, the Xiang Lin Si Temple is not crowded at all. It stands almost directly opposite Cheng Hoon Teng Temple, just a few meters away. There were no tourists at all, aside from us, when we were there. But some locals were also there to pray and light incense sticks. I believe it’s a Buddhist temple because of the several statues of Buddha inside the temple and another big one at the center of the main prayer hall. There’s no describing how I felt as we walked along Harmony Street. There was just a great deal of joy in knowing that the people of Malacca peacefully co-exist for centuries despite the differences in religious beliefs. There was a sense of triumph in realizing that the people of Malacca had their main places of worship stand almost next to each other in just one street. (That’s like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Beyonce sharing the stage in just one concert. Or Mariah, Whitney and Celine. Or the Rolling Stones, Queen, and U2! OK, enough, you get the feeling.) But seriously, though, it was a great feeling. It is a glimmer of hope, faint perhaps but still a glimmer, that the world can  choose  to live together in peace, in tolerance, and — wait for it — in harmony. "https://hippie-inheels.com/little-travel-guide-to-langkawi/,malaysia,"Little Travel Guide to Langkawi Langkawi is a group of 99 islands off the West coast of Malaysia and is a popular vacation spot for Asian and Middle Eastern people. Two of the biggest things Langkawi is known for is marble (kawi) and eagles (helong), hence the name Langkawi! Less than 20% of Langkawi is developed, it’s the first UNESCO Geopark in SE Asia, and there is loads of reserve forest and mangroves making it natural and unique. Let’s get started with a little travel guide to Langkawi. Quick facts about Langkawi Money: 1 USD is equal to 3.77 Malaysian ringgits. Some prices for example: you can rent scooters at about 35 rinngits (9.30 USD) and use a public toilet for 1 ringgit (.25 cents USD), while most basic meals come in at 10 ringgits (2.7 USD). SIM card: You can get SIM cards easily at little shops. The best for this area is Celcom. Tourist Area: 10 minutes from the airport is Cenang (Patai Cenang) which has many hotels, tourists, western fast food along side Malay street food, spas and a nice beach with all kinds of water sports. We used Naam tours, which cater to luxury or comfortable travel. We didn’t have any issues with this company and our driver, Azmann, was really cool. Duty Free shopping: Langkawi became a duty-free port in 1987. There are many duty-free shops, so you’ll be able to get great deals on imported things you may need. If you’re here on vacation it’s still not cheaper than home but for us, it’s cheaper than India. Monsoon season: The rains are in the months of March until November, but it is not a big monsoon like I have in India. It may rain a couple of hours each day or not at all. Beaches: You have many options but Datai Bay is a “don’t miss”- ranked #9 of 10 best beaches in the world by National Geographic. How to dress: practice what I preach, not what I do. I wore tank tops but really you should probably wear a t-shirt (although most tourists and some younger local girls wore tank tops). It’s mostly a Muslim country and most tourists are from Saudi so you don’t want to wear clothes that look revealing. For swimming, I wore a swimsuit with shorts overtop and kept my lifejacket on to keep covered more. Where to stay in Langkawi For high-end check out Andaman Langkawi  which is on the nicest beach in Langkawi &amp; Top 10 beach in the world from Nat Geo. Also, the Vivanta Taj which is on its own island. Aseania Resort – mid range budget This is a nice 3 star huge resort with good food and nice pool. We recommend Aseania  for those reasons and because it’s in the popular Cenang area and within walking distance to SO much. We stayed 4 nights. There is an awesome show I’ll explain more on later. The rooms have comfy beds and there is a pool and games like pool table, darts, and fooseball. Berjaya Resort – 4 star We LOVED our stay at Berjaya . This is a really cool resort and great option if you can’t afford somewhere like the Andaman. It was so relaxing being in the “jungle side” but if we went back I’d go for on the huts on stilts in the water “beach side”. Breakfast was a big ordeal with people dotted around making everything you can image fresh for you. It’s got beach access and a pool."https://hippie-inheels.com/my-kuala-lumpur-travel-diary/,malaysia,"My Kuala Lumpur Travel Diary While I’ve made three visits to both Singapore and Bangkok, I somehow hadn’t been to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia until just recently. Friends of Ben and I live there and we went for a 4-day visit. I love seeing a new city with friends that live there (Dom is English and Massy is Malay – you might remember we went to their wedding in Singapore a couple of years ago) so I can see it as a local and not as a tourist. My Travel Diary from Kuala Lumpur (KL) Sometimes, that means I miss the “tourist” things to do but it also means I see what it would really be like to live there. In any case, this article is more of a travel diary than my usual “guides” to places. But I will quickly lay out the top things to do in KL here so you know! We got around to some of them. At the end of the post, I’ll also share all the basics you need to know about Kuala Lumpur before you visit. Top things to do in Kuala Lumpur Check out the famous Petronas Towers (tallest twin towers in the world) and walk across the sky bridge which connects them and shop below at the KLCC mall and park. Go to the top of the KL Tower (the 7th tallest in the world) Visit Batu Caves Visit Sri Mahamariamman Temple Learn about the culture at the National Museum Shop at Central Market Visit the Blue Mosque (and several other beautiful mosques) Wander through China Town Visit the Thean Hou Temple (a stunning Buddhist temple) Zoos, aquariums, eco-parks, theme parks, botanical gardens, butterfly and bird parks, and more museums Our visit to KL Dom and Massy live in a condo in Mont Kiara, just outside the city center near Little Korea and Solaris, where we went for some yummy Korean BBQ! We stayed with them and easily could take Grab cabs anywhere – but often didn’t have to since Dom works for Mercedes and has a company car. We were pretty spoiled getting driven around by him most of the time! You might have read as well that Uber is stopped in SE Asia and the Grab app is now the #1 app to use. We did do many of the tourist items above but skipped just the caves, temples, and mosques. Dom and Massy are both Muslim and to go to a mosque isn’t a tourist activity for them. I have seen probably thousands of temples and didn’t feel the need to make special trips to see more – and the caves are a Hindu site (Ben and I have explored so many caves on our travels). It would be going just to “check it off the list” which I’m not interested in doing. The best view of the Petronas Towers is probably from the KLCC park below during the day. At night, you can go to Marini’s on 57 and see them literally right behind your table while you have drinks. They aren’t lit up all night and turn off at I think midnight. If you drive to KL Tower , keep in mind there is hardly any parking! It’s better to take a taxi and get dropped off. You can pay 50 Ringgit to go to the observation deck, which is not quite at the top. We paid 100 Ringgit (around $25) for sky level observation (as high as you can go – and where you see those infamous glass boxes that go out over the city). Sadly, it was raining, so we could only go to the observation deck. They did end up giving us our money back for the sky level since it was closed when we tried to go up. We spent some time in China Town and I’ll admit, we bought fake Ray-Bans lol. Ben has lost 3 real pairs, so it was about time he got a fake pair. We also got some to give to our security guards at our complex in Goa. There are about $5 and are actually polarized. They have fake Nikes, luxury bags, jerseys, watches, you name it. Some look really real while others are obviously fake. I almost bought a Puma fanny pack but then snapped out of the daze because WTF was I even thinking? From China Town, you can walk on to Central Market . You can eat street food along the way like cold stone ice cream, fresh coconuts, and meat on a stick. Go-karting in Kuala Lumpur at Sepang The BEST thing we did in Kuala Lumpur was go-karting. Ben and I try to go-kart everywhere we travel and had actually even go-karted in Malaysia before, in Langkawi . We went to the famous Sepang track to go-kart next to the F1 track. These cars hit 100 km/hour (62 mph) on the straight-aways and it’s a 1 km track. It was exhilarating! On the first straight away, going that fast, I actually yelled like I was on a rollercoaster. Dom races motorcycles and even he said it’s the fastest go-karting he’s ever done. Beyond that, in Goa, we drive slow on curving village roads so whenever Ben and I are on a highway in another country going fast we are like “wow we are flying” when in reality it’s not fast. When I go back to the USA, and my dad is going 70mph on the highway, I feel like it’s way faster than I’ve ever been which my speeding tickets would beg to argue with. So, being on a go-kart going 62 mph was seriously fun. If you go to KL, you have to do this! It’s near the airport, not the city center. It was expensive – and you HAVE to do the series 3. Food &amp; Shopping in KL We went to the city center for the tourist things and went to some different neighborhoods there like Bangsar, a kind of affluent neighborhood that many expats live in. While in Bangsar, we had the yummiest breakfast at Antipodean which is Dom’s favorite place for an English fry-up. In this area, you’ll also find shops like Lulu Lemon and various restaurants like Panchos (Mexican), Mikey’s NYC pizza, and tapas bars. Dom and Massy had come to Goa over Christmas and were not impressed by our “best steak in Goa” places. So, they took us for their “best steak in KL” places. THESE were some seriously good steaks. We had dinner one night at Pampas in an area called Old Malaya. Another night we had steak at The Whiskey Bar and Steakhouse. The steak and ribs were really good. Prices in KL are a little all over the place. For example, if you eat really local it’s super cheap (backpacker budget style). If you go to a nice sit-down steak place it’s more like $100 for two people to eat and drink booze. But you could spend even more if you went to a Michelin place or at a roof-top bar. It’s by far cheaper than Singapore, though! The road that The Whiskey Bar is on is called Changkat Bukit Bintang. It’s a busy road similar (but not as wild as) Khao San Road. For nightlife, it seems like KL is a mix between Singapore (sometimes classy) and Thailand (sometimes a little trashy). There are seedy areas where you might not want to go out alone or might see some hookers – but it’s not like Bangkok with sex shows and all of that. It seems like a very chill nightlife vibe and this road is a good place to start out. Many hostels are near here and a lot of backpackers stay around here so you’re bound to meet other travelers and locals and expats, too. We did do a little bit of shopping. There is one mall called the Berjaya Times Square which has a theme park inside – we avoided this one. We did go to the Pavilion mall which is quite fancy, but only so we could go to the food court. We had some really nice Teppenyaki and then because I’m me, I got an Auntie Anne’s pretzel with cheese… twice. We also popped into the mall at the Petronas Towers to grab what Dom and Massy swear is the best Korean chicken wings ever made. It’s a chain fast food restaurant called 4 Fingers and once we started eating, we stopped talking, because they were so damn good. Please get these! They have them in Singapore, too. If you want more street food options, you’ll also want to hit up Alor Street which is known for great food (but used to be the red-light district). Near our friend’s place is the area called Little Korea and we went for the famous Korean BBQ where you cook it all on the little hot plate in front of you. So tasty! We also checked out a little tiny electronics shop, which I don’t have the details for (but message me if you want them), to buy a Chinese knock-off of a GoPro. Dom showed us his when they came to visit and my old GoPro 3 is so outdated. I don’t have the budget now to spend $500 on a new one, so this one for $130 that looks the same and comes with everything and has the same specs, I was down for. It’s called the SJ Cam and it’s quite popular in Asia. I’ll hopefully be making more videos now! Rafting in KL If you drive just an hour and some away from the city, you are in the lush jungle. Dom booked us an epic whitewater rafting trip that he had done before. The night before the trip, I got food poisoning which I haven’t had in at least 4 years (and forgot how terrible it is!). I swear it was not the 4 whiskeys I had the night before – definitely food poisoning lol! At first, I thought it was just the booze, but then things got crazy and I was sure it was not the booze – seriously! Someone believe me, haha. They all went and I was so jealous. Ben called me from the trip and I cried because I had been looking forward to it so much. But, these things happen. The photos look stunning. Ben said it was the best thing he’s done in ages, so I think you should definitely check it out. You can check out some tours here . Basics to know before visiting KL Arriving in KL: The airport is about 45 minutes or more from the city center (also called KLCC). You can take a metro or a taxi. A Grab cab will only cost you around $10-15. We flew Malaysia Airlines, which I have flown before twice. They offered us only filtered cups of very warm water and when I asked for a sealed cup of water (those little ones with the aluminum lid you peel back) they said, “okay you can have one but now you cannot have one with your meal” . Umm, okay cheap-asses! Here’s a TIME article about why you shouldn’t drink tap water on planes (even the filtered “drinking” water). Getting around: They have public transport: Monorail, MRT, and LRT. You can also use oBike to rent bicycles around town and drop them off wherever you are done. To get around, use  Grab App . Uber is no longer in SE Asia. Grab is much cheaper and more reliable than using a taxi. Taxis will sometimes rip you off and take you longer routes. From KLCC, you can walk most places. How long to stay: You can easily see the tourist things in a weekend but if you want to get into the KL vibe, try to stay at least 5 days."https://hippie-inheels.com/11-things-to-do-in-langkawi/,malaysia,"11 things to do in Langkawi to get an adrenaline rush! Langkawi has SO much to do while you’re there. It’s very tourist friendly and many people from KL come here for vacation to find a little adventure in nature. 11 things to do in Langkawi Jet Ski island tour This was my favorite part of Langkawi! You can go to 8 islands and see a lot of major natural attractions at once through Mega water sports at Chenang beach. I wrote a whole article about it here: Jet Ski Langkawi Price: $125 USD for two people on one Jet Ski Booking &amp; Reviews: Viator   Rhino 4WD tour waterfall stop No, there aren’t rhinos in Langkawi… Oh wait, was I only one who thought maybe there were? Rhino is the type of 4-wheeler that you can take a tour of the mangroves on. It’s such a blast riding around the rivers, jungle, paddy fields, and is a unique way to sight see. With our tour we got to go to a waterfall during the middle and learn more about the rubber trees that are all around the island. Tip: wear sunblock and mosquito spray. Price: 249 ringgit for 2 people in one car, 1 hour tour ($60 USD) Location: Naam Paku Pakis Activity Center at Tanjung Rhu beach Parasailing I hadn’t been parasailing since I was a kid but thought it wouldn’t be that great since it’s not a huge adrenaline rush. It still wasn’t such a rush, except when you first kick off from the boat, BUT the reason this is a must in Langkawi is the view! There are 99 islands making up Langkawi and you can see the islands, white sand, and different shades of blue water from up high. It’s quite a view! Take a goPro up with you around your wrist. Price: 245 ringgits ($60 USD) for 10 minutes for 1 person, 358 for 2 people Location: Naam Paku Pakis Activity Center at Tanjung Rhu beach Go Karting at Morac Ben and I go-kart whenever we see a new place! We love the one in Goa. This one kicked Goa’s butt though! It’s a professional track (who knew they had those?) and was really long. Price: 38 ringgits for 10 minutes ($9 USD) Location: Morac International Karting Circuit Sdn. Bhd. Lot 67, Jalan Pantai Cenang, Mukim Kedawang Mangrove Tour With this tour you’ll go down Tanjung Rhu river and through manmade channels in the mangroves. You’ll start at Kilim river to see the HUGE bat caves which are quite stinky but very cool. You can see the area where all the eagles eat, go in “crocodile cave” which apparently no longer has crocs, and end with lunch at Mangrove Fish Farm. The fish farm has sting rays and you can actually feed them… just by sticking your hand hear their slimy mouths- such as weird ass feeling but loved it! We didn’t have lunch here because it was only 11 am but most people did. Tip: There is a chance to swim at Long beach so pack a swimsuit!   Price: 165 ringgits ($40 USD) for 3.5 hour tour, 350 per boat Location: Naam Paku Pakis Activity Center at Tanjung Rhu beach SkyCab &amp; SkyBridge The SkyCab is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Langkawi since it’s steepest on earth, 708 meters high on Mt Machincang. It is the longest single robe cable car in the world – 950 meters! At first I wasn’t really sure what the appeal was since the cable cars go slow… but it’s not so much about the ride as it is the view you get from the ride. The views were 10x as cool as parasailing and I was bummed Ben was afraid of the height and didn’t come. The water was so blue against the white sand and seeing all the islands spread out was pretty damn cool, plus you can actually see Thailand. I know I sound like Sarah Palin here, but you really could. I didn’t go across the SkyBridge (which is 100 meters off the ground and the longest curved bridge in the world) because it was about 4 pm and I’d been in the sun all day with a pretty bad burn. Tip: Pay extra for the VIP cab for nice seats, or ones with glass floors. Check out the SkyDome video before hand, which is 3D-ish and really neat.   Price: SkyCab for adults 30 ringgits ($7 USD), or 85 for glass bottom, 20 for childen. SkyDome is 15 ringgits. Pay 50 ringgits to get in express no wait lane. Location: Oriental Village, Burau Bay Interactive 3D Museum Brand new to Langkawi, and the biggest 3D museum in Malaysia this is actually a LOT of fun. I didn’t even know what a 3D museum was, but we went through taking all kinds of silly pictures. I think only the photos can explain what this place is all about. I have a whole post: Photo Gallery 3D museum (Coming soon, I know you can’t wait ;)) Price: 30 ringgits for adult ($7 USD), 28 for child, and free for child under 2. Location: Oriental Village, Burau Bay Mardi fruit farm This is an agrotechnology park where fruits are grown without pesticides. Ben and I had seen much of this in Goa, but I can imagine if you come from somewhere less tropical this would be a big learning experience. You can try new fruits like star fruit, dragon fruit, water apple, and yellow watermelon. Price: 25 ringgit per person Location: Jalan Padang Gaong, Lubuk Semilang Ayer Hangat Spa Village This complex has the only salt water hot spring in Langkawi and hosts a spa and private jaccuzi’s you can rent out. The hot springs are great for soaking your feet then going for a walk on the “reflexoloy path”. I only lasted about 30 seconds because I have such sensitive feet walking on stones. I went for a foot scrub &amp; massage here which was heavenly; read more on my article spas in Langkawi. They also have stingless bees making honey… something I never knew existed. Price: $something… I can’t remember! Location: 16 Jalat Air Hangat, Mukim Air Hangat Sunset dinner cruise I think a lot of companies offer something like this – but not all of them can say Pitbull took their cruise ;) Really! This was Ben’s favorite part of the trip. The food was great, the boat was really cool and there were only 6 of us on the trip. They treated us great with cold towels, free booze, ponchos at the end when it rained, and lots of laughs. I have to say that the photo above was taken by Ben, or he will feel used as my photographer haha. Price: 200 ringgit per person ($48 UD) Location: boat takes off from main Naam office in Kuah. Night Market The market can move around, but there are two big ones (Wed. and Sat.) in Kuah that are really nice. It’s half food, half clothing. Most of the food is very unique and not westerinized. Go with an open mind and try new things! I tried a few, but to be totally honest I didn’t love the food- I am not a very adventurous eater. I like lots of the snacks but not the fish ones which are frequent, because I’m not much of a fish eater. Check out my post on what to eat in Langkawi . Price: free to enter location: Kuah More fun things to do in Langkawi You could try aintball, horseback riding, helicopter rides, dirt bikes, zorbing, paintballing, Craft Complex for souvenirs, Eagle square, snorkeling at Pewar island where there are sometimes reef sharks. Just go to Viator and see all the tours they offer. They have tours for every budget – just filter to adventure ones!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/02/maldives-top-budget-resorts/,maldives,"Maldives: Top 7 Resorts Under $200 The Maldives is notorious for being expensive. But is it true? Well, depending on how you choose to travel and where you choose to stay. One thing you need to know if you’re planning a trip to this stunning archipelago is that there are two types of islands: private and public. Public islands, also known as local islands, are where locals live. Private islands are those occupied by luxury resorts, open only to their guests and staff. As you might guess, local islands are much, much cheaper. If you’re on a tight budget, here’s our Maldives Travel Guide . We’ll be creating a separate list of hostels/guesthouses in the local islands.       But if the Maldives is one of your dream destinations, you’ve probably imagined yourself staying in an exclusive resort. The Maldives is a popular honeymoon destination. During my visit, everyone’s paired up and seems to be on a romantic getaway. The bad news is, most exclusive resorts here are darn expensive. Like, seriously . Some charge thousands of dollars per night (the likes of Four Seasons). The good news is, there are exceptions. Some offer rooms for less than USD 200 (PHP 10,000) per night during off-peak season, and $300 (PHP 15,000) in peak season. Sure, they are not as cheap as those you’ll find in Southeast Asia or South America, but if you’re familiar with how high hotel rates can get in the Maldives, you’ll know that $200 is already pretty low. Most exclusive resorts have two major types of accommodations: beach/land rooms and overwater bungalows (water villas). Of course, staying at a water bungalow looks tempting, but they are usually the priciest rooms. Those on the beach are much cheaper. But before you book, here are a few notes to consider: Don’t take published rates at face value . Most do not include service charges, GST, and other taxes, a total of 23% of the published rates. AIRPORT TRANSFER isn’t included either! Check the airport transfers arrangement. For some resorts like Olhuveli, booking airport transfers with them is mandatory . At Olhuveli, transfers are via a speedboat, which costs 210 USD roundtrip per person. (That’s still low compared to other resorts requiring seaplane transfers at 500 USD.) But not all resorts are like that. With Filalholi, transfers can be arranged elsewhere, which means cheaper options. Consider your meal options . Being in a private island means your only food source is the resort’s free breakfast, restaurants, and in-room dining service. Expect them to be overpriced, too. Rooms may be booked full-board, half-board, and bed-and-breakfast. Consider your tour options, too . Being at an exclusive resort means you can only hire them for your touring needs, and their tour rates are much higher than those outside. Here are the 7 highest-ranking resorts below $200 (off-peak) based on TripAdvisor reviews as of Feb 2017. Note that, like I said above, many of these published rates do not include taxes and other fees. Prices may change without notice so always double check before you book.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Rihiveli by Castaway Hotels &amp; Escapes 2. Vilamendhoo Island Resort &amp; Spa 3.

You’ll love all the adventures in the Maldives you can find. Many people consider it their dream vacation destination, imagining days laying around the white, sandy beaches and turquoise water. While some only see this as a luxury honeymoon location, staying on the local island is altogether a different experience and one that is more affordable and perhaps cultural. I stayed at Mirian Sky and through them, got to try all these incredible adventures that I’ll always remember. Tips Before You Go: We highly recommend Kiwi for finding the best possible flights to the Maldives. Compare the different routes and prices on their site . The Maldives is warm all year round, so you’ll be sure to want to dress for it! Check out our favorite summer essentials here. Yes, you  do need a visa to visit! iVisa makes it super easy to figure it all out. Since these are all the best adventures in the Maldives, you’ll want to get travel insurance just in case something goes wrong. We LOVE World Nomads , and it’s the most recommended company around. For even more tours in the Maldives, we use Viator. Check here for all their available activities . Adventures in the Maldives at Mirian Sky Hotel 1. Turtle Snorkelling Can you spot the turtle? They do camouflage well! Turtles are one of the big three, along with shark and mantas, that people want to see in Maldives. And these adorable green mammals are much easier to find. We were brought to one of their frequent sighting spot to snorkel and saw a total of four turtles during our hour-long snorkel. They were friendly enough to let you swim alongside them. A still extracted from one of my video – the turtle coming up for water! Turtle spotting aside, there are some wonderful fauna and corals to be seen at the spot. Picnic Island and its surrounding sea are brimming with sea life and we saw a turtle there, too (as well as an octopus!). 2. Dolphin Safari A pod of dolphins swimming alongside our speedboat By luck, we stumbled into a pod of Sharp Tooth dolphins on our way to a shipwreck and they cruised with us for a while. Though we didn’t manage to snorkel with them as they swam too fast, we got very close on the speed boat. Smaller, darker with a pointier beak than the bottle-nose dolphins, there were almost twenty in this pod. During one of our attempts to swim with them, we heard their sonic communication – which was an experience in itself. 3. Sand Bank Visit One of the things that I had seen of Maldives before my visit was a drone video of the couple on a deserted sand bank. Needless to say, I was excited to visit one. A natural body of sand that congregated by the way of waves and currents, the sand bank we visited was made of broken corals. Combined the white sand with azure and turquoise water and you have paradise! 4. Shipwreck Snorkelling Anchor point shipwreck! There are numerous shipwrecks around Gaafaru Island and Anchor Point is the closest one that happened 150 years ago. The only visible sign of it above the water is a single metal rod that reaches above the sea level, but the underwater world is something else entirely. Claimed by nature, the shipwreck is now a haven for fishes and other sea creatures. You can still make out the top part of the ship and its rough shapes, though in many parts it’s already overgrown. I was surprised at how many sea lives there are – nature will always find a way! 5. Sunset Dinner by the Beach Nightly sunset view from the bikini beach Given the romantic setting as well as the beautiful sceneries, it would be a shame if you don’t enjoy a sunset beach dinner. A surprise by our lovely host at Mirian Sky Hotel , the eight guests were treated to a sunset dinner at the bikini beach of Gaafaru. With the sun setting behind us, I shared one of the most romantic moments in my life with two German sisters and our lovely host. Buffet dinner by the beach! Served buffet style, we had some fish from the line fishing as well, which leads to my last item on this list… 6. Line Fishing and Eating Your Catch Speeding off to the sunset to fish! If you have never fished before, you must try line fishing! I had very little faith in my fishing abilities, however, aside from failing to cast the line, I was able to catch two fish by myself. Done in the evening and twilight hours, line fishing is a delicate act of knowing how much you should release the line and play tug-of-war with the fish. Freshly caught and cooked by the chef at Mirian Sky We caught eight in total, not counting an accidentally nurse shark (we let it go, of course). Which was cooked for dinner that night! Where to Stay in the Maldives: Mirian Sky Hotel on Gaafaru The exterior of the hotel! I spent a week at Mirian Sky Hotel in the Maldives. A three and a half hour ferry from the capital Male or an hour on a speed boat, Gaafaru is a small, unspoiled fishing village with a population of just over one thousand. If you want to experience a local island in peace and quiet with friendly staff and excellent service, then you are in the right place. The two-floor hotel is modern, clean and has all the basic amenities. The hotel isn’t very big, which is nice and peaceful, and the reception area is the same as the dining room. There’s a small outdoor patio with a place to wash sand off your feet. Here’s a quick video of the hotel as well as my room: The air conditioning works perfectly, the room is clean and well equipped with a mini-fridge, LCD TV, wardrobe, vanity table and chair, double bed. The bathroom, standard of many South-East Asia countries, consist of a shower with no curtain or stand. The room is spacious and nice! There’s also a fan if you aren’t cool enough! I enjoy my room so much that I end up staying in and watching a movie from my hard-disc in the evening. I am anti-social, I know. View from the balcony While the room has a balcony that does face the sea, you won’t use it much as it’d put you in direct sight of the mosque. My welcome lunch! The food, prepared by the chef Mohammed, exceeded my expectations. I had pancake, omelet, and toasts for breakfast, there’s also tea, coffee, and cereal, too. He will literally make you anything you want and does the best salad! Lunch and dinner usually consist of salad or pasta with chicken or fish. Though you can get authentic Maldivian food, fried rice or noodles etc as well. Everyone at Mirian Sky is friendly and did their best to take care of me and make sure my stay was great, as they do with all the other guests! Now that I’ve finished gushing, here’s some nitty gritty info: Shower gel and shampoo are provided, as well as towel and beach towel. You have free use of bikini beach and their sun bed and umbrella. However, the beach is not on the doorstep and requires a five-minute walk or so. You will have to cover up your bikini or swimsuit as well since it is a local island. The WiFi is very weak and glitchy. It only works on one device at a time but does work all over the island. I recommend that you get a SIM card if the internet is essential to you. Its proximity to Male is a huge bonus. The choice of cheaper daily public ferry if needed is a superb option. However, the fact that it’s opposite a mosque opposite means you’ll hear it every morning at 5 am."https://hippie-inheels.com/7-popular-maltese-foods-try-visit/,malta,"7 Popular Maltese Foods You Have to Try When You Visit If you are ever lucky enough to travel in beautiful Malta, these are some of the most popular Maltese foods you have to try! Malta may be a tiny island nation, but what it lacks in demographics, it compensates for by its unique heritage, rich culture, history, and ruggedly beautiful landscape . Maltese people approach their meals (and most food in general) with great passion and enthusiasm, so it hardly surprising to note that food contributes greatly to the island’s identity. Whatever the occasion, happy or sad, huge portions of calorie-laden dishes, usually accompanied by equally huge amounts of wine or beer, are the highlight of any event. Traditional Maltese food ranges from Mediterranean-style fare featuring fish, vegetables and olive oil to heavy pastries and hearty pasta dishes. Here are 7 Maltese foods you’ve got to try when you visit 1. Pastizzi (Pea or Cheese Pastries) Diamond-shaped pockets of heartburn-inducing flaky pastry, stuffed with either ricotta cheese or mashed peas, pastizzi are everyone’s favorite snack usually eaten straight out of a greasy paper bag whilst still warm. The savory pastries are available from little shops found in every Maltese village and are the island’s best-known hangover cure. A nightmare for local nutritionists, pastizzi are irresistible even to staunch health freaks and, surprisingly, have also featured in a recent political row while the country is holding the EU presidency! Pastizzi, flaky pastries filled with either cheese or peas 2. Ftira biz-zejt u t-tadam (Maltese bread with olive oil and tomatoes) Move over Subway! This Maltese ‘sandwich’ is particularly popular during the hot summer months. Round, unleavened Maltese bread known as “ftira” is rubbed with fresh tomatoes (or tomato paste), olive oil and stuffed with a mixture of olives, onions, sun-dried tomatoes and capers. Sometimes canned tuna or gbejniet (goats-milk cheeselets), and bigilla (a traditional paste made from mashed beans) are added too. We’ve also even eaten variants of the traditional ftira which included hard boiled eggs or raw ‘zalzett Malti’ (Maltese sausage). Totally worth any potential health risk! Ftira biz- zejt u t- tadam , the local sandwich 3. Hut tal-istagun (Fresh Seasonal Fish) Although we will probably get our fair share of fish throughout our travels in Asia, nothing really beats a lampuki pie, a shortcrust pastry pie stuffed with Lampuki (dorado fish), olives and vegetables. Lampuki are a local favourite and they join a list of other seasonal fish which, apart from being cooked in a pie, may also be served grilled with olive oil and lemon. The safest bet to check the best catch for any particular season, is by visiting the Marsaxlokk fish market. Even if you don’t plan on buying any fish, it is still worth going to Marsaxlokk early in the morning to watch the fishermen in their ‘Luzzu’, a brightly coloured fishing boat, return to land with their catch, which is promptly sold from stalls right at the water’s edge. Marsaxlokk village is full of fish restaurants usually owned by the the fishermen’s families, ensuring that your lunch is the freshest and best quality available. The Luzzu, a traditional Maltese fishing boat 4. Bebbux Bl-Arjoli (Stewed Snails) Yes we eat snails, and no they are nothing like French escargots. The Maltese variety are somewhat smaller in size and are cooked in a spicy tomato stew, traditionally served with a garlicky mixture called “arjoli”. This dish is usually presented as an appetiser in the more traditional type of restaurants, and in the local village clubs alongside cheap whiskey and beer. One of Michelle’s favourite food items! Bebbux, Maltese snails served as an appetiser 5. Timpana (Baked Macaroni Pie) Every Maltese family claims to hold the perfect recipe for the best timpana, passed on from past generations, and we’ve never tasted one we didn’t quite like! Cooked macaroni are tossed in a rich tomato sauce containing minced meat, bacon and very often, chopped liver. Eggs and sometimes cheese are then added, and the heart-stopping mixture is enclosed in pastry and baked in an oven. The result is literally a delicious, flaky macaroni pie often served as a starter prior to a meat dish. Not great for the hips but a firm favourite in every household! Homemade Timpana 6. Stuffat tal-Fenek (Stewed Rabbit) The king of Maltese Sunday lunches, rabbit is possibly the island’s most revered dish. Whilst the better tasting rabbit dishes are always served by somebody’s great-aunt, they can also be found at some “local-style” restaurants (commonly associated with the rural villages of Bahrija and Mgarr) which usually have a menu limited to rabbit, horse and quail dishes. Rabbit is traditionally cooked in a stew, or in garlic and wine and served with roast or fried potatoes. Our favourite part of a fenkata (rabbit meal), though, is the hearty spaghetti with rabbit sauce served right before the main dish. A dish of homemade stewed rabbit 7. Imqaret (Fried Date Pastries) Introduced to Malta by the Arabs who conquered the island almost a thousand years ago, these diamond or rectangular-shaped sweet pastries are stuffed with a mixture of dates, spices and citrus and then deep fried. They’re great to eat whilst on the go, or alternatively can be served drizzled with honey, accompanied by a scoop of ice-cream. Whatever your preference, the pastries are highly addictive and just one is never enough! Imqaret If you’re ever in Malta, and you wish to immerse yourself in the local food scene, be sure to put these Maltese foods on your foodie bucket list. There’s nothing like traditional food to guarantee a true taste of the island!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/04/hbo-game-thrones-filming-locations-tourist-spots/,malta,"15 Game of Thrones Filming Locations that You Can Visit It’s that time of the year again! You know that another Game of Thrones season has begun when your Facebook news feed is flooded with cheers of excitement, cries of anger, and death threats for friends who are posting spoilers. It is not difficult to understand why HBO’s highly entertaining and often wildly brutal adaptation of the George RR Martin novels has reached the legendary status in pop culture. It has all the right ingredients: compelling characters, convincing production, unpredictable plot twists, and the right amount of fantasy. And dragons! Put it all together and you get a weekly serving of wonder. Brutal at times, but still pretty mindblowing. But there’s one more thing that always captivates me about this phenomenal hit. On the Season 6 premiere, for instance, when the khalasar made their way to Khal Jhaqo with Daenerys Targaryen in tow, I was so drawn to the arid landscape that surrounded them that I googled it right away. Bardenas Reales in Spain, it turned out. I have been so fascinated with GoT’s choices of filming locations that I have come up with a mission: visit as many of them as I can. The first that I set foot on was Essaouira in Morocco, which was where all Astapor scenes were shot (including that part where Khaleesi freed the Unsullied and ordered them to kill their masters). And when I backpack across Europe later this year, I’m certainly making stops in Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Spain.       So I decided to make a list of the fictional places in the series and their real-life counterparts, where they were primarily filmed. But before we begin, some notes: This list covers exterior shots only. Many of the interior sequences were actually done elsewhere. For example, Dobrovnik’s streets and coastal walls are used mainly for King’s Landing, but interior shots (Red Keep, Iron Throne, etc.) are done in sets in Northern Ireland. This is not 1:1. King’s Landing may be filmed mainly in Dubrovnik, but they also took supplementary footage of Essaouira and Malta as the Westeros capital. Dubrovnik also stood in for the City of Qarth in Season 2. Many of these sites have been digitally modified or enhanced by the show. Winterfell, for example, is almost unrecognizable as Castle Ward. This is not complete. I will update this as the series moves forward. Now that we got the caveats out of the way, here it is: a Game of Thrones fan’s travel bucket list! WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland 9. Pentos: Malta 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia The ancient port city of Dubrovnik has seen a steady increase in tourism since they first used it to depict King’s Landing in Season 1. Executive Producer David Benioff said, “The first time we saw Dubrovnik, I was in shock, because the whole city really looked the way we pictured King’s Landing looking.” 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland Castle Ward tower digitally modified to create Winterfell The vast 1000-acre grounds surrounding Castle Ward has hosted the production team as they bring to life many of the series’ key moments, including scenes featuring Winterfell, seat of the House Stark and capital of the North. Much of the first 2 seasons took advantage of the sheer size of its grassy farmyard, perfect for army camp sequences, and ancient structures including Audley’s Castle. 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland The Magheramorne Quarry is an abandoned limestone quarry in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is where the Castle Black set was installed. (It has also been used as Hardhome and the city walls of King’s Landing in Season 2’s Blackwater episode.) It is currently not accessible to the public, but there are pending plans of reopening it as a mountain biking center. Fingers crossed. 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland Iceland as Wildling and White Walker territory Iceland in real life Most of the events north of the Wall of Westeros are realized in Iceland. This includes the glacier at Snæfellsjökull (I don’t even know how to pronounce that properly) which was used as the Fist of the First Men; Mývatn Lake, a frozen lava lake close to the town of Akureyri, which was where Mance Rayder’s wildling group dwelled; and Grjótagjá Cave, where Jon Snow and Ygritte had a very wet consummation of their love. 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain Alcázar of Seville as Sunspear in Dorne Alcázar of Seville in reality Dorne was actually what I was so excited to see on television. I just thought it had the most character. Dorne, the southernmost region of the Seven Kingdoms, in the books was actually inspired by medieval Spain, so it totally makes sense that they chose Seville as location, including Sunspear, seat of House Martell, which was actually the Alcázar of Seville in reality. This season, fans are also excited to see the Tower of Joy, which was said to be Castillo de Zafra, a 12th-century castle in Guadalajara. 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland Also known as “raised beach,” Ballintoy Harbor in County Antrim can take pride in being real-life Iron Islands. Images of this picturesque harbor were digitally enhanced to mimic the jaw-dropping seascape of Pyke and Lordsport. You remember that scene where Theon Greyjoy first meets his sister Yara? That was shot here. 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland Stannis Baratheon’s bailiwick is actually Downhill Strand, a beach destination in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It’s where Stannis and Melisandre set the Seven idols on fire and where Davos allowed Gendry to flee. 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland Kingsroad Do you remember when Arya, Yoren, Gendry, and Hot Pie were on the way to the Wall after escaping King’s Landing? Did you notice the beautiful avenue flanked with rows of eerie but beautiful trees? That’s the Dark Hedges of Armoy, which in the GoT world is Kingsroad. It is actually a road of beech trees, which according to Northern Ireland’s tourism website , were planted in the 18th century by the Stuart family “to impress visitors as they approached the entrance to their Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.” 9. Pentos: Malta See that arch in the background? That’s the Azure Window, a famous feature of the Maltese Island of Gozo. Azure Window IRL. And now we go all the way back to Season 1. The Mediterranean archipelago of Malta has been home to the GoT team for many days, too, mostly during the filming of Pentos. In particular, the 16th century Verdala Palace, the official summer residence of the Maltese President, stood in for the mansion of Illyrio Mopatis, the merchant-prince who sold Daenerys to Khal Drogo in marriage. The wedding feast then took place in Gozo Island, the second largest island in Malta. 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia Meereen, the largest city that Daenerys Targaryen has conquered and ruled so far, is the Croatian city of Split in real life. Situated on the coast of Dalmatia, this picturesque city faces the Adriatic Sea. Among the sites used in the series is the Diocletian’s Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site, whose cellars provided replacement for the underground passages in Meereen. 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia Šibenik, a quiet medieval town in Central Dalmatia, Croatia, made its GoT debut in Season 5 as the free city of Braavos, where Arya Stark found herself after sailing from Westeros and where the Iron Bank is located. 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco Essaouira as Astapor Essaouira in real life The port city of Essaouira along the Atlantic coast of Morocco serves as Astapor, one of the cities in Slaver’s Bay. Essaouira is where most scenes in Astapor was shot, including the unforgettable and iconic scene wherein Daenerys Targaryen bought and freed the Unsullied, and then ordered her dragons to attack. Dracarys! 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco Aït-Ben-Haddou as Yunkai Aït-Ben-Haddou IRL. Also in Morocco is the old city of Aït-Ben-Haddou, a fortified city on the edge of the great Sahara desert. It’s no stranger to movies as it has been the setting for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), and Prince of Persia (2010) among others. But in the GoT world, Aït-Ben-Haddou is Yunkai, aka Yellow City and one of the three great city-states in Slaver’s Bay. 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain Vaes Dothrak has yet to be featured, but rumor has it that the team tapped the exotic charms of Almeria, a city in Andalusia, Spain, for this. We’ll see in the coming episodes. 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Many places have been used to depict the many parts of Dothraki Sea, but in the Season 6 premiere, the place we casually refer to as “wherever the fuck Drogon dropped Daenerys” is Bardenas Reales, the 100,000-acre badlands in southeast Navarre, Spain. "https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-visit-chichen-itza/,mexico,"Things to Know Before You Visit Chichen Itza, One of the New Wonders of the World Before you visit Chichen Itza, it’s good to read up a bit about what it is – and what you need to know about visiting this New World Wonder (and UNESCO site) like how to get there, how much it’ll cost, and the best times to visit. I’m going to cover the basics in this post so you make the most of your time there! Chichen Itza is an archeological ruin built by the Mayans and was a major focal point of their lives between 800-1200 AD. It was the largest city in those times but I’ll share more about it further in the article. You can read more about it here . Two million tourists visited here in 2016. Tips Before You Visit Chichen Itza Getting to Chichen Itza You can get here a variety of ways from local transportation like shared mini-buses, taxi, a tour, or by renting a car. We had a rental car because we flew into Cancun but visited Tulum, Merida, Celestun, and some other places. For a rental car, I recommend searching on  Rentalcars.com  because they compare are the major car rental websites and save you time. From Tulum, it will take about an hour and a half. From Merida, it is about the same. It was easy to find with Google Maps and we had no issues. There aren’t a lot of gas stations on the highway, so fill up. You’ll pass a lot of shops selling the cute stuff you see in Tulum, like dreamcatchers, way cheaper along the highway. Tour options for Chichen Itza You can take a tour to Chichen Itza from pretty much all towns around like Tulum and Merida. You will see travel agencies selling these but you can book ahead and get a better price. I recommend searching on getyourguide.com. Click here to see the 30 tours available and sort them by the highest recommended or by the city you will be coming from. Don’t waste your time with any of the tours that are “skip the line” or “special entrance”. I also do not recommend a “full day tour”. There isn’t that much to see and it’ll be exhausting. While I preferred to drive there, I did miss having a guide to tell me stories! If you do a tour, you’ll have a guide. If not, you can hire one at the entrance. Price of the Chichen Itza tickets + parking It was $3 USD for parking (or something close to that – I lost the receipt) and $19 USD for tickets for two people. For a world wonder, that’s pretty cheap! It’s free for kids under 12. I think they only take cash. When to visit Chichen Itza Weather-wise, November through March is the best time to visit as it gets very hot in the summer months and rains past June. But, you’ll find more crowds during the best weather! We went late November and had NO crowds. Some key points are that you should arrive when they open and avoid Sundays. Remeber that if you are coming from Cancun, Tulum, or anywhere in that coast, you are in Eastern Standard Time and when you get to Chichen Itza, it’ll be Central time, so you gain an hour. Chichen Itza is open from 8 am to 5 pm. We didn’t arrive until 9 but it was totally okay and we didn’t have any crowds. Dec/Jan wouldn’t be so lucky I guess. Within an hour, it was packed, though. Sundays the entrance is free for Mexicans, so you might want to avoid that day which can be more crowded. What to bring to Chichen Itza You can pack a lunch and eat inside, which we saw many people doing. You should also bring your swimsuit and towel if you want to go into one of the two cenotes that are inside the property. We peeked in at famous one and it didn’t look very nice so we didn’t go in. It was very very murky and we didn’t see anyone else swim either. The place is pretty spread out so wear comfortable shoes and maybe bring some water, although you can buy water, Powerade, and all kinds of other drinks at normal prices. What you actually see inside Chichen Itza El Castillo – the big main pyramid you cannot miss it Great Ballcourt – the largest ballcourt in Mesoamerica, where they say the losers of the game were sacrificed on the temple Temple of the Warriors – hundreds of columns around a big temple The place is incredible. While there, you can shop and will see many souvenirs and while most are overpriced, things like magnets are still super cheap so it’s nice to pick up some gifts! In general, though, prices are higher here and you should definitely shop around and negotiate on the cost. You could spend about two hours here easily and even longer if you want to. You could also pop in to see the main pyramid and bounce if you felt like it. I recommend walking to all the places on the map though and checking them all out!"https://hippie-inheels.com/merida-mexico-travel-guide/,mexico,"A Little Merida Mexico Travel Guide: Where to Stay, Eat, Drink, and Shop Ben and I spent about two weeks in Merida Mexico in November. I love staying in one place that long because you really get time to explore the city, try the best places to eat and even find lesser-known places by accident. While I haven’t been there long enough to tell you everything about the city (I’ll be back, though!), I was there long enough to help you guys with your future trip to Merida, so I put together this little Merida Mexico travel guide to give you a look at what we did for two weeks in Merida. A Little Merida Mexico Travel Guide Amazing architecture and colorful buildings all around! Santa Lucia Square The daily city tour bus that leaves from Santa Lucia square, which is in Spanish only Christmas in Merida! Nearby beaches, on the gulf side, which you can reach within 30 minutes from the city Can’t get enough of the colorful buildings and tiles called “pasta tiles” Before you go Passport &amp; Visa – You do need a passport, but as an American, I did not need a visa. A tourist visa for Americans and UK citizens is 180 days. You can check on iVisa to see if your nationality needs a visa. Health insurance – From what I’ve read medical care is fairly cheap in Mexico, but as always I recommend getting health insurance and you can get a quote here from my favorite company, which is also what Lonely Planet and Frommer’s recommend. WiFi – Merida has public WiFi which you can connect to and it will remember and reconnect you when you are in those areas. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. I had a WiFi device and Ben had a local SIM card, so we were covered. Almost all restaurants have WiFi there. Flights – We came from India which isn’t that helpful to most people reading this. From the USA, flights to Cancun are usually cheaper than directly into Merida and you can rent a car or take a local bus to get to Merida from Cancun. But, you can also fly straight into Merida which is better. I use Kiwi.com to get the best deals. Rental Car – From Cancun, we drove to Merida. We also went to Chichen Itza and Tulum. There are barely any gas stations on the highway, FYI. You don’t need a car in Merida, according to most expats there, but we used our car multiple times a day and I could not have been comfortable there without it as we went all over the city, to the beaches, etc and like to have our own transport, not bothering with local buses. For good deals search on Rentalcars.com because they search all the car rental companies and it saves time and money. Keep in mind, you need to get pesos before you leave the airport because there are tolls on the highway which are actually expensive (like $15 in total). Uber –  There is Uber in Merida! It’s very cheap and they are reliable. Most did not speak English but it wasn’t a problem for us to get anywhere. It’s all in the app! Language –  Although it is mostly Spanish-speaking, there are some Mayan-speaking people, too. Most people we met did not speak English and my Elementary style Spanish was incredibly helpful. If you stayed here long-term, you would have to learn some Spanish. Makes me realize we take India for granted since everyone here speaks English. Money –  You should take out pesos from an ATM when you arrive. Right now it’s about 18 or 19 pesos to the dollar, which is a really good exchange rate. I use Charles Schwab so I have no ATM fees. Some ATM’s will give out USD, but I think using pesos is easier. Here are some tips for handling money abroad . Day Trips from Merida –  Celestun to see the flamingos, Los Colorados for the pink lake, Chichen Itza and Uxmal for Mayan ruins, and Even Tulum could be day trips. Check out what each one is and tour options by clicking each link. We had a rental car and internet so drove ourselves. Celestun and the ruins are 1.5 hours away but Los Colorados and Tulum are 3 hours away. Where to stay in Merida We stayed in a handful of Airbnb’s and three different hotels. We kind of bounced around because it was fun to see all the haciendas and colonial homes. I am obsessed with the old colonial houses here and wanted to stay in as many as I could! I wrote an article about the many Airbnb’s in Merida that we stayed at. I think renting a car and using Airbnb is the best way to just get the feel of a city and have some freedom – and not feel like a tourist. Check out that article to see incredible Airbnb’s that will not break the budget – some are SO cheap. We also stayed at a few hotels. We didn’t book anything until day of and just took what we could get sometimes. When we first showed up we stayed at a relaxing one called Luz En Yucatan ( review here ), later we stayed at an amazing one called Hotel Hacienda Merida . We also stayed at a really horrible huge hotel because it was last-minute and I won’t even mention it, lol. Where to eat in Merida Eating is basically the best thing to do in Merida and I planned entire days around what I was going to eat, which I’m sure doesn’t come as a surprise. When we arrived, we stayed near Santa Lucia square which has a lot of great cafes and restaurants around. Santa Ana square is also popular, and then you have Paseo Montejo which has a lot of restaurants and bars (a little more upscale). But you can stay in “centro” and walk to all these places plus Uber is in Merida so you can hitch a ride just about anywhere in centro for $2 and to downtown areas like Walmart, Malls, etc for around $5. Bengali Kaffeehaus This was told to me from a friend and I came here for a quick coffee but ended up staying for two hours chatting with a woman, Penelope, who had lived in the Yucatan for years in Uxmal where there are more Mayan ruins and Jaguars! I loved hearing her thoughts on Merida and really enjoyed the coffee and vibe here. It’s a tiny place, though, so not somewhere I’d take a laptop and try to work. La Chaya Maya Give me Yucatan food all day, every day! I was there long enough to try some yummy things but La Chaya Maya was great and full of locals. Yucatan food is different from Mexican food outside the state because of the Mayan people. Pictured above is Sopa de Lima which has turkey in it and really does taste like lime and then panuchos which is kind of like a taco, also with turkey. Cochinita Pibil – slow roasted pork you can have on tacos or panuchos Chilaquiles – basically breakfast nachos Huevos Motuleños – breakfast dish, Mayan style Tacos, panuchos, solbutes – all kind of similar tacos, fried or unfried Queso Relleno – pork stuffed in edam cheese Burritos, quesadillas – basically like the tacos (lol) not like what you get in the USA Sopa de Lima – lime soup Churros &amp; pancakes – street food desssert There so are many more things, I haven’t even scraped the surface! At the places I mentioned, you might pay 200 pesos for your meal. Los Trompos This is a popular, cheap place to eat which has chains around town and does delivery which we also did one night at our Airbnb. I ordered the beef tacos and the buffalo ribs – I can’t believe that I never thought to put buffalo sauce on ribs!? They serve all this kind of stuff with ranch dressing which is SO KEY. The hot sauce at Trompos is sooo hot and so good. I live for habanero sauce! Mercado 60 Love, love, love this place. It’s a food market near Santa Lucia. I had wings from the wing shop, and Ben had BBQ ribs from that BBQ shop. There was pizza, local food, craft beer, and a band playing cover music. It was a really nice vibe and affordable. Hermana Reuplica I wish I could remember all the names of what we ate here. This is a popular place with two locations. We went to the one outside of Centro, where we had some friends nearby (thanks, Monica!). We ordered a lot because there were five of us. The top image has those little fried things which they are calling what sounds like “kiwi” but I don’t know if that’s the spelling. They are filled with a spiced pork. The sandwich is the conchita pubil I mentioned before, a slow-roasted BBQ pork.  This place is a fusion restaurant which serves modern Yucatan food. It has an upscale vibe but is affordable. They are known for their craft beer which was really good! La Tratto This is a popular Italian place in Santa Lucia. It’s pricey for food in Merida, but still like 200 pesos for a main. The pizza was good, burger was okay, and the ceasar salad was good, BUT this cheese dip WAS AMAZING. It was not Yucatan style, but one of my favorite things I ate in Merida. You’ll see it on the appetizers, it’s the only cheese dip. Mi Viejo Mohino This was a recommendation from my hotel, near Santa Lucia which a good selection of breakfast items… and yes, this is breakfast if you can believe it! It is a mocha frappe and some kind of avocado sauce beef tacos. They are known for having cheap, tasty, diner like food. Apoala This is meant to be the best Mexican with Oaxacan touch, located in the square. The reviews made it sound amazing but I was disappointed. It took so long for anyone to pay attention to us, take an order, get a bill, and the food was not that good (maybe I just didn’t like the style), plus is was really expensive compared to anywhere else we ate. Hennessy’s We went to this Irish pub because we met at an Irish pub in India five years before, and it was our Anniversary. It was okay. The staff was really nice. A little kid selling flowers came and sat with us and we got him some food. Casa Dominga This is kind of like Mercado 60 (the same types of food) but more expensive and really rich looking people were hanging out here with some fancy cars outside at valet. We preferred Mercado 60 as it was more laid back, but the food here was good. We ate at the burrito stall. Ek Chuah at Rosas Y Xocolate, Oliva Enoteca, Trattoria La Pasta, Blue Marlin, and La Pigua were all on the list but we ran out of time. We also cooked at home in the Airbnb a couple times as we could get so many things at the grocery store here that we can’t have in India. It was nice to have a home cooked meal with good ingredients! We did not go out and party at all, but La Negrita was always recommended and we walked past one night to see it full with what looked like people waiting to get inside. Lucero del Alba and El Nuevo Tucho were also recommended by our hotel, Luz en Yucatan. What to do in Merida Shop (tips below) Eat (tips above) Daily events on offer (listed below) Free tour of the city via bus leaving Palacio Municipal at 930 am Mayan World Museum of Merida (I went but it was closed Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and I don’t know if that’s always or just that week was unlucky) Walk Paseo Montejo for shops and food Other museums, zoos, and more on this map but I didn’t think they were worth the time, although I’m sure they are lovely – it’s up to you! Where to shop in Merida There are lots of little shops but most are not catered toward tourists and this is NOT Tulum, so don’t expect bohemian style homewares or clothing. I have to say I was bummed since I didn’t have time to shop in Tulum and the Merida shopping wasn’t great from what I could tell from looking and researching really hard. The best thing is the weekly markets so I’ll share about those first. Merida is the “cultural” capital of the Americas and they have a lot of community stuff going on, which is awesome. Monday – 9 pm dance performance at Palacio Municipal   Tuesday –  830 pm live music at Santiago Park Wednesday –  9 pm show at Olimpo Cultural Center Thursday –  9 pm traditional performances at Santa Lucia Square Friday –  8 pm Mayan style ball game (like the ancient times) at Plaza Grande &amp; the whole of Calle 60 is closed and there is a lot going on like street vendors, shopping, and live music. Saturday –  Paseo de Montejo at Calle 47 a big market with music from 7-11 pm then later there is one from 9-1 am at Calle 60when the street closes Sunday –  “Domingo in Merida” the biggest market is on Sunday in the main plaza all day. During the day, Santa Lucia has a market, too. Plaza Grande has a handicrafts market. I did check out some of the most famous shops in Merida and loved meeting the shopkeepers. Uxmal de Taxco Just put this place on Google Maps, and you’ll be there without issue. It’s just near Santa Anna park on Calle 60 between 45 &amp; 47. I met the owner, pictured above, who told me about the history or his family working with silver. They use 100% pure silver, which is quite unique! Casa De Las Artesanias This is a goverenment co-op shop with fair fixed priced so you do not negotiate here. They had all kinds of hand made souvenirs and I recommend coming here instead of a normal souvenir shop. From hot sauce to Christmas ornatments, there was something everyone would want to buy. It’s a VERY small shop and just a few shops down from the silver shop mentioned above. Artesanias On the corner of 55 and 60 is a little shop with more upscale souvenirs. They are unique and made in Mexico, but it was expensive. I didn’t make it to Crafts from Chiapas State or El Studio which were both recommended to me, so if you have time check those out, too. Celestun Celestun is about an hour and half from Merida. It is known for the flamingos that hang out here. You cannot swim in the water where you do the boat tour as there are crocodiles in there! We didn’t go at the best time. We were told in a month (December) there would be 10x more flamingos than what we saw – but wow, even what we saw was amazing. We spoke in Spanish with our boat driver and it was a lot of fun to learn new words and even understand why flamingos are pink (they eat a pink worm!). The water was red, too from a mineral in the mangroves this time of year. When we left, we did a mangrove tunnel tour (really cool just a few minute detour). There was a rainbow that made it even better! It was 1400 pesos for the two of us from a random guy who walked up to us in the parking lot. The official ticket window was selling boat tours for 1600 pesos for two people. You do have to do a tour to see the flamingos . You can drive down from Celestun park to the beach which is beautiful. Enjoy sunset there and eat some seafood! The road to Celestun does not have much in ways of food or gas, so fill up and keep in mind it is a very skinny, windy road, so don’t drive too fast! Chichen Itza One of the new wonders of the world is Chichen Itza, the largest Mayan ruins and the most famous. I loved visiting here! I wrote a whole article about what you need to know before you go. You can take a tour or rent a car. Go early! Getting to Merida and Away As mentioned, we flew into Cancun because it was so much cheaper. We were going to rent a car anyway so it was no issue for us. If you also choose to fly to Cancun and drive to Merida due to flight prices, then you might need an airport hotel the night before you fly back out. There are two options, the Courtyard Marriott and a Comfort Inn. The Courtyard Marriott isn’t much more expensive but is a much better hotel, so I recommend spending a bit more for it. You’ll see that Uber is a headache in Cancun, similar to why Uber can’t come to Goa (violence and fighting with taxi Mafias). We left our rental car and had three Ubers cancel after messaging can we meet them further from the airport to avoid violence. We finally got an Uber but once reaching the hotel realized we weren’t going to be able to go out to dinner in Cancun by the beach like we planned. We were stuck at the hotel. Luckily, they have GOOD yet expensive food. We had nachos, a burger, and Ben had a steak that he actually loved. So there ya go! That is the ins and outs of Merida. We had such a good time here and I KNOW Ben and I will be back to Merida in the future, perhaps this Spring so stay tuned! Once I go, I’ll update this guide and add even more amazing places to eat and things to do.

There are many other beautiful places to see and many time less crowded. When we talk about the food and restaurants, you only list the typically overpriced tourist traps. Some of them have good food, some of them absolutely no. This includes the list that you missed. What all of them have in common, they are overpriced for what the deliver. A 2nd point, you recommend Uber. Well, Uber still is illegal in Merida where other similar services are not. Think about if this is a good hint for a traveller. I don’t want to blame you, your blog is very interesting, but of somebody who is in the top 50 travels blogs of this world, i would expect bit more substance. Those are only some thoughs of somebody, that lives and works in Mérida. Keep in writing, i will read it ;-) Rachel Jones February 4, 2018 at 5:45 pm - Reply This is from two weeks there (which I mention) and if someone had never been to Merida, is at least some information for them – obviously less than if I lived and worked there. I do think Uber is great for travelers there and do recommend it. It’s not totally legal loads of places around the world and I still use it. I write my experiences on my blog and what I would suggest to my own friends and family. Hawks Eye Travels February 5, 2018 at 11:23 am - Reply Thanks for sharing. And the travel guide will help lots of us planning to visit Merida. And you prefer staying in one place that long because you really get time to explore the city, try the best places to eat and even find lesser-known places by accident."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-riviera-maya/,mexico,"What makes Riviera Maya a perfect destination for travellers seeking a glamorous trip? If you are looking for the luxurious then Riviera Maya, Mexico is somewhere you must visit, with Beautiful silky white beaches, sun kissed tans and fabulous designer swimsuits everywhere you turn. With such rich array of fresh seafood on offer and some of the best cocktails we have tried, the quiet calm of untouched islands or a rich party ambience, Upmarket Boutiques and vibrant cities, it’s hard to see why you wouldn’t!! What 5 star Hotel is the best in Riviera Maya? The Blue Diamond is 40 minutes south of Cancun, this adults only luxury hotel is nestled within a lush tropical jungle garden and only a 10 minute walk to the turquoise Caribbean Sea. Once we had settles in we didn’t want to leave the room, which were all decorated crisp white with everyone having their own individual creation inside and all the latest technologies and some even having their own outside (built in) bathrooms or you can go super luxury treating yourself to their presidential suite which came with its own private pool! This hotel had everything we wanted from their own spa, a la carte restaurant, impeccable service and we especially loved the morning walks along the river pathways which the hotel had been built around. What about boutique hotels in Riviera Maya, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Easy.. Grand palladium colonial resort and spa is especially ideal for those who have kids. This hotel is so big you would never have to leave! This hotel is located on its very own private beach offering a huge array of water activities from Pedi courses, kayaking down to water yoga (yes, we had to go it a go). The highlight for us was the service provided here, they have a theatre which is open every night with a different act, we would walk past every morning to see them resetting the whole stage with new props and backgrounds etc. and the effort that went into them was superb. You would only have to order your drink once and the waiters will be making sure you do not have an empty drink all night. So for all this we couldn’t recommend it enough. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Riviera Maya? Riviera Maya has a catalogue of activities for any traveler, Hiring a Catamaran with your friends, private big game fishing trips, snorkelling the fantastic coral reefs along this stretch of coast or swimming with the elusive whales sharks just to name a few. You can spend the day at the archeological site of Tulum Mayan Ruins or soak in the atmospheres of Xel Ha &amp; Excarat, Mexico’s famous ecological parks with natural lagoons, wildlife and entertainment or simply lay back and enjoy the rays of the sun at one of the many finest beaches of offer, as we said there is something for everyone. Where are the best hang outs during the day in  Riviera Maya? Forget your shopping trip and get out of the city, pack your beach bag and head to Akamul Beach , this pristine beach is the definition of pure perfection! This once upon a time small fishing village has in recent years earned its rights up there with the finest of beaches in Mexico and were not surprised.   Located south of Riviera Maya, this small bay offers up some of the best snorkelling and diving experiences, with only a couple dive shops you are not overwhelmed with choices. Once you have settled down on the warm white sand, dip our toes in the water and within minutes you will be surrounded by an array of turtles chomping on the grass beds that draw so many sea life to this bay. And best of all.. it’s FREE! There is no one walking the beaches haggling you for tours as it is all right there at hand, if you did want to try your hand at diving then as we mentioned there are amenities for it but snorkelling is the activity of choice here. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in  Riviera Maya and what are their best dishes? Now this restaurant is located in Playa Del Carmen, just around the corner from Legends sports bar. If you’ve got cash to plash and get those taste buds tingling then Oh Lala should do the trick! With International cuisines at a pretty penny, using only the best locally sourced ingredients and a very extensive wine list. This place had a fantastic atmosphere and we had great fun watching the chefs showing their skills in the open kitchen, we went the full works with 3 courses and all being as good as the next, starting with Tuna Focaccia,   Rock lobster for our main (to share and was the best lobster we have ever had and we live by the sea!) ending with a pistaccio gelato which when you closed your eyes tated like you had bitten in to a fererro rocher! If you do find yourself looking for that special meal then we highly recommend this place. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Did you hear about the fererro rocher gelato… ask if you can book a table just for dessert and you have found your place! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Mexico in itself is a magical place, filled with beautiful beaches each one being a great sunset view but our spot has to be the south beach of Tulum. With stretches of brilliant white sand and the vibrant colours of the caribbean sea, it is a picture perfect backdrop to a beautiful sunset, with many visitors of the day already on their next adventures you will find this beach at sunset has a feel of exclusivity."https://hippie-inheels.com/the-4-best-oaxaca-tours-day-trips/,mexico,"The 4 Best Oaxaca Tours and Day Trips Oaxaca is one my favorite cities in the world – that’s why I keep coming back again and again. This year is my 3rd trip to the city, and I’ve spent about 7 months here total. I’ve done just about all of the Oaxaca tours and day trips multiple times, so I have lots of opinions about the best things to see and do in this beautiful part of Mexico. If you only have limited time, it’s nearly impossible to fit this all in, so you’ll have to decide what you’re most interested in. But many of the tours or sites can be combined together, as some are close geographically and therefore easier to pair together. Oaxaca Tours &amp; Day Trips If you’re contemplating what Oaxaca tours or day trips to do, check out my list below, I’ll give my honest opinion about the must-do’s even if you’re short on time! See the Impressive Hierve El Agua I think Hierve el Agua is a must-must-do! It’s one of the coolest and most impressive natural sites I’ve ever been to. It’s impossible to convey in pictures just how crazy these petrified waterfalls look in person – you just have to go. This is also one of the best Oaxaca tours or day trips for fans of hiking and the outdoors. So What are Petrified Waterfalls?   Well, I have wikipedia to help me with this answer. The “waterfalls” at Hierve el Agua aren’t the typical “water cascading over a cliff” type of fall. Instead, it’s petrified rock that cascades (visually looking like a waterfall) over the side of some cliffs. This is caused by the natural mineral springs that bubble at the top and slowly trickle off the side. As they trickle, they leave behind calcium deposits that slowly collect over thousands of years. Trip Tips: Try to go during a slower tourist time (weekdays, and non-holidays) if possible. This site is even more magical without the crowds. If you’re really short on time, many Oaxaca tour operators do a trip to Hierve el Agua with 5 stops total (including the largest tree in the world at El Tule, traditional weavers in Teotitlan del Valle, the ruins at Mitla, Hierve el Agua, and a mezcal distillery). This can be great to see a lot in one day, but you will get VERY little time at Hierve. We did this Oaxaca tour on our first trip to the city and felt like we only had about a half hour at the site. It definitely wasn’t enough time and I couldn’t wait to get back and explore more. Do the full circular hike, or at least hike down to the bottom of the Cascada Grande. The Cascada Chica (which is a bit confusing because it’s a wider cascade and the more heavily visited) is the most accessible. From the parking lot, you need only walk down a short trail to get here. This is where the biggest crowd will be and also where people swim in the few spring pools. I’ve never been a fan of bathing in these pools, they just feel crowded and I’d rather be taking photos anyway. So spend a little time here, then pass on to the Cascada Grande – follow the trail up and then back down and to the left. Cascada Grande is taller and a more vertical cascade. This is a great spot for pictures since you can see the wide and gradual cascade of Cascada Chica from here, and there are usually much fewer people. But this isn’t the best part. Find the trail that scales down the cliff on other side. If you head a little way down the stone steps, you’ll be rewarded with an epic view of the vertical cascade/stalactites of the Cascada Grande. It’s really pretty amazing. And if you have enough time, follow the trail all the way around the loop, it’ll take you below both cascades, and then back up the other side of the Cascada Chica in a loop. It’s a fairly short trail, should only take 1-2 hours, but make sure you wear hiking shoes, be careful of the wet steps on the way down, and be ready to go straight back up in elevation at the end of the trail. How to Get to Hierve el Agua: Take a tour – tons of tour operators do Hierve el Agua tours, or tours to several sites that include Hierve (see my above note about the popular 5 stop Oaxaca tour) Rent a car – This can be a great way to see many of the sites out on the eastern highway (and there are a lot!). Driving in Mexico is always an adventure, but a lot of the highway to Hierve el Agua is well paved and cared for. But beware that the last portion goes through some remote rural towns and the roads there are very rustic. Public Transportation – I haven’t taken this method but have read a lot about it. Take a colectivo (a maroon colored shared taxi) from the centro to the town of Mitla. Here you will transfer to a camioneta (a truck) that will take you to Hierve el Agua. You’ll sit in the back of the covered pick-up truck bed. Not for the faint of heart, but adventurous for sure! Learn about Traditional Weaving – Teotitlan del Valle, Mitla, and Santo Tomás Jalieza Oaxaca is famous for their beautifully woven textiles. They’re unique here because they are still made by traditional methods – either by backstrap loom, or large wooden looms with foot pedals. Most traditional weavers also use natural dye methods which are more vibrant and last longer. How to See Weavers in Oaxaca Tour – I think a tour is the best way to see and learn about weaving in the Oaxaca valley. This way, you can have your day arranged, and learn the process from start to finish, as well as the variations in methods. And if you don’t speak Spanish, you can have the benefit of understanding everything through your bilingual guide. Rent a Car – You can also choose to visit these weavers on your own. I would just recommend you call or contact them ahead of time so they can be prepared for you. Please note that most of the weavers and their staff will only speak Spanish. Teotitlán del Valle – Master Weaver Jacobo Mendoza Ruiz Jacobo Mendoza Ruiz is an absolute expert who has won many national and international awards for his beautiful work. He and his wife show the weaving process from start to finish: from how they clean and spin the wool, to the ingredients used for the natural dyes, to the looms in progress with the work. He sells mostly rugs – they are extremely high quality and intricate. Contact – 951 524  41 57 Avenida Benito Juárez #91 Teotitlán del Valle, Oaxaca Mitla – Arturo Hernández Quero Arturo uses both backstrap loom and large wooden looms for his work. He also uses natural dye techniques for his yarn. He sells a variety of beautiful textiles – from scarves, to clothing, to rugs, and blankets. Contact – 951 189 9147 rebozos_tn@gmail.com Santo Tomás Jalietza – Crispina Navarro Gómez Crispina Navarro Gomez is another weaving master – she’s won national awards for her super intricate work. She and her sisters work together with 4 generations of the family on backstrap looms in a circle every day. Their work is colorful and vibrant. They sell many types of textiles, belts, bags, and accessories in their adjoining shop. Contact – 951 528 1114 Benito Juárez # 42, Santo Tomás Jalieza, Ocotlán, Oaxaca Visit Ancient Ruins – Monte Alban, Yagul, and Mitla The Oaxaca area is filled with pre-hispanic ruins. If you’re a history buff, you will love visiting these unique ancient sites. So which to visit? Monte Alban: Monte Alban is the most famous ruin in the area and the most popular Oaxaca tour or day trip for ruins. And for good reason, it’s a really impressive site! It’s located up on a mountain at the southern edge of the city. It boasts an amazing view over the city, as well as the whole central valley. Besides that, there are many large temples covering a large swath of land. You can climb over most of the pyramids to explore and get even better views. If you can only visit one ruin, this is the one to see as it’s the largest and most impressive. The only trick is that it’s not close to many other tourist sites, so it’s typically visited on it’s own. But there are tons of shuttles that go here so it’s not difficult to get to. How to Visit Monte Alban: There are daily tourist shuttles from the western side of the Zocalo, so this is the easiest option. They are affordable and leave a few times a day. You can also organize a taxi or an organized Oaxaca tour if you prefer. Yagul : Yagul is the least visited ruin of the 3, but one of my favorites in the area for it’s location and because you will usually have the grounds to yourself! Yagul isn’t a huge site, but it has several pyramids, and a unique yellow stone “maze” section that is quite picturesque. It’s also on a plateau in the northeast, so it has an amazing view of the mountains and the valley. Another interesting feature is the additional small mountain you can climb to get to a higher vantage point. There is another very small pyramid up here and even more incredible views. How to Visit Yagul: Since this ruin isn’t as heavily visited, it’s not as easy to find transportation. Tour/Taxi – You could hire a taxi or an organized tour for the day. Public Transportation – Another option would be take a colectivo that heads east to Mitla, and ask to be let out at the road to Yagul. You would then need to walk about a mile up the hill to the ruin. Just be prepared and try not to do this in the heat of the day! Mitla: Mitla is a popular ruin to visit because of the intricate and beautiful carvings in the walls. The carvings are geometric and very detailed, which is quite different from other indigenous ruins, even in the Oaxaca valley. I do really like this site, but it’s doesn’t have much to offer other than viewing the carvings. If you have to skip a ruin, I think it’s okay to skip this one. But it is well located on the eastern highway on the way to many other Oaxaca tour sites. If you are already visiting Hierve el Agua or a mezcal distillery in Santiago Matatlan, it’s an easy stop. How to Visit Mitla: Mitla is easy to visit by tour or transportation Tour – Many tours come here as a stop during the day. You can organize this with any Oaxaca tour operator. Public transport – There are many colectivos (shared taxis) that go to Mitla from Oaxaca centro. Once in Mitla, you can easily walk to the entrance to the ruins since it’s a small town. Tour Some Mezcal Distilleries A trip to this region wouldn’t be complete without a Oaxaca mezcal tour! Mezcal is a liquor that is made from the same plant as tequila, but made with different varieties of agaves, and with different production methods – so it has a completely different flavor. It’s also still made in traditional ways – almost always on small farms in small batches. The traditions are kept alive here and it’s really interesting to learn about and taste it. Santiago Matatlan is the most famous town for mezcal production in the state of Oaxaca. This town has only 8700 people but 140 distilleries! How to Visit the Mezcal Distilleries: Tour – The best way to visit the distilleries is by taking a tour – that way your visit will be arranged and you’ll learn all about the history, as well as the process from start to finish. I highly recommend using Las Bugambilias to take this tour. Rene is an expert about mezcal, and will take you to the most exciting, authentic and traditional distilleries. Rental Car – If you’d like to visit on your own, you can rent a car and head out east to Matatlan. Most distilleries will prefer that you call ahead and some will have English speaking staff and some won’t. If you do this I recommend you visit: El Rey de Matatlan This distillery is right off the highway so it gets lots of tourists. But because of that, they are really well set up to do a short tour with anyone who drops in at any time. They show you how the agave is roasted and processed, and then lead you through a tasting. Their espadin varieties are not my favorite but their wild agave varieties (or silvestres) are delicious. Gracias a Dios This is a beautiful distillery with well designed logos, and authentic and delicious mezcal. The mezcal maestro (master mezcal maker), Óscar Hernández Santiago, and his family have been making this traditional spirit for 4 generations. The most fun varieties they make are a mango infused mezcal (very subtle mango flavor) and a gin made from agave (instead of grain) and 32 other herbs and flavors. Be sure to call or email ahead of a visit! Mezcal Macurichos This mezcal distillery is also steeped in tradition. The family has been making mezcal for 50 years, winning many awards. Gonzalo Martinez Sernas, the mezcal maestro here, makes it his mission to test, experiment, and refine his varieties and blends. It’s obvious when you taste them how special and unique they are. Be sure to call them ahead of a visit so they know to expect you. On your visit to Oaxaca, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to explore the sites and traditional villages outside of the city!"https://hippie-inheels.com/why-everyone-is-obsessed-with-mexico-city/,mexico,"8 Reasons Why Everyone Is Obsessed With Mexico City Right Now I’ve been to the beaches in Mexico many times, but I had never actually spent quality time in Mexico City…at least not until last year. I booked a last minute flight to Mexico City, and did very little research as far as what to see and expect. And I must say, I was more than pleasantly surprised. I wanted to share why everyone is obsessed with Mexico City right now. I found this cosmopolitan city just brimming with art, culture, history, and charm! But first, let’s talk safety since I know this is the first thing on people’s minds. Safety Talk Given the bad rep Mexico as a whole has received due to the corruption and crime, there’s good reason to have an element of caution and fear when visiting Mexico. But generally speaking, the south of Mexico is actually quite safe. Without a doubt there are areas to be avoided, but the most dangerous parts of Mexico are actually the north, close to the US border. Before booking ANY trip, it is always best to check out the State Department’s travel advisory website  for updates on any safety rules and recommendations. Besides that, some safety rules of thumb I always follow are: Never walk around at night alone Never get intoxicated either alone, or in the company of people I just met Wear a zip-able purse and cross it over my shoulders Use caution in the metro, especially when it gets super crowded Stay in the tourist areas where there are lots of people around Okay, now that we’re done with that, let’s get to the fun stuff! So what makes Mexico City a destination that I will personally return to again and again? Why everyone is OBSESSED with Mexico City at the moment… 1. El Centro Historico (Historic Center) Just strolling through this historic 500-year-old neighborhood is a treat. It is here you’ll find the Zocalo, or main plaza, which is the largest plaza in Latin America. And of course you could never miss the crown jewel of the Zocalo, the Catedral Metropolitana (Metropolitan Cathedral). Adding to the charm are the street musicians and vendors. The Palacio Nacional (National Palace) and Templo Mayor (Main Temple) – just to name a few – are also within close proximity. 2. The Cutting Edge Museums If you are into museums, then welcome to paradise. With over 150, there is no shortage of museums whatsoever in Mexico City. What’s your preference? Art, history, culture…take your pick. There’s bound to be something that will spark your fancy and you could easily spend your entire trip just shuffling from one museum to the next. For a full list of available museums, check out THIS link . The Museo Nacional de Antropologia (National Museum of Anthropology), Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), and Chapultepec Castle (houses the National Museum of History) are fan favorites. But honestly, if you just went to admire the architecture of the buildings, you wouldn’t be disappointed. And don’t forget the downright quirky museums like the Cartoon Museum, Shoe Museum, Pen Museum, and Chile and Tequila Museum. And for myself, visiting the museum and previous home of the ever popular and world-renowned Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo, was a must see on my itinerary. Remember museums are closed on Monday. 3. The Vibrant Street Art The dynamic street art scene in Mexico City has received headlines globally, and it’s not surprising why. Local and international artists alike have made this beautiful capital their canvas, and it’s so exciting to stumble upon them! For some help with exactly where to go, check out HERE and HERE for some spots. And if you’re like, screw it – I just want a tour. That’s available too! Check out HERE and HERE where these companies offer street art tours of the city. 4. The Trendy Cultural Scene Upon leaving the airport and making the 30-minute drive into Mexico City’s city center, you might be thinking…trendy? This is not trendy. But after driving through miles of ugly urban sprawl, within the city itself you actually find pockets where there is fine architecture, narrow cobblestone streets, and oodles of charm. Between the art galleries, boutiques, and snazzy coffee bars and restaurants, Mexico City offers as much culture and charm as any large European city. 5. The Bustling Markets Wandering through the markets of Mexico City is like taking a peek into the daily life and fabric of Mexican culture. The markets are all a bit different, and with over 300 to choose from it can be overwhelming to decide where to go. Honestly, you’re more likely to just stumble upon one than plan to go. But to help you decide, below are some of my favorites: Mercado La Merced (Mexico City’s largest Market) Mercado de Jamaica (Flower market) La Ciudadela (Mexican crafts and folk art) El Mercado de Ampudia (Traditional Mexican candy) 6. The Booming Gastronomy Mexican cuisine has more to offer beyond drinking tequila and the famous tacos and guacamole (although being a Southern California girl, there is nothing wrong with tacos and guac!) Not only is Mexico as a whole famed for its gastronomy, the city’s vibrant and innovative chefs have placed its restaurants on the culinary map! From street food, to hole in the wall digs, to fancy restaurants, Mexico City has something for everyone. For the true foodies out there, I’d highly recommend a Mexican Flavors Gastronomic Tour . For tips on where to dine, check out THIS article on 12 of the hottest restaurants! 7. The Urban Parks The many parks around Mexico City create an urban oasis full of beauty and tranquility. My favorites are the found in Rome and Condesa. In Roma, Plaza Luis Cabrera and Plaza Río de Janeiro are great to stroll through. In Condesa there are also two beautiful parks, Parque Mexico and Parque Espana. Parque Mexico is particularly intriguing as it used to be a horse race track of the Jockey Club of Mexico before being transitioned into it’s current state as a family friendly park. 8. The Teotihuacan Pyramids Didn’t know there were ancient ruins just outside of Mexico City? Well don’t worry, that’s what I’m here for. These beauties are estimated to be dated around 100 BC, and are one of the largest in Mesoamerica. They are a treat by themselves, but I would highly recommend a sunrise hot air balloon ride over the pyramids, paired with a guided tour of the ruins. Bookings can be made easily online, through your hotel/hostel staff, or through the tourist locations around the city center."https://hippie-inheels.com/the-5-best-ruins-to-visit-in-mexicos-yucatan-peninsula/,mexico,"The 5 Best Ruins to Visit in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula There are thousands of Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Peninsula, southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras – many of them still unexcavated. Of the hundreds that are open to visitors, even just starting with the Yucatan Peninsula, how do you decide which of the best ruins to visit in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula to explore? I’ve spent over 2 months here, so I want to share with you the best Mayan ruins to visit in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula – from popular and well-visited sites, to a few that are more off-the-beaten-path – you’ll get a well-rounded idea of Mayan history and architecture. The 5 Best Ruins to Visit in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula And if you follow the order I list them in below, you can easily shape your itinerary – first spending a few days in the colorful colonial city Merida, and then relaxing on the beautiful beaches of Tulum (with a few side trips to the ruins of course!). Chichen Itza Why Visit: Chichen Itza is usually considered the most important Mayan site so it’s a must see. It’s thought to have been a capital city of the region, and a major trade center. This also means it’s the most touristy ruin in the area – but it’s still definitely worth a visit! How to Get To Chichen Itza: You can visit this site from almost any town in the peninsula, but it’s easiest and fastest from the city of Merida. You can drive yourself – it’s a straight shot on the highway – or arrange a tour in one of the many tour agencies in the city. Or if you prefer to DIY it, you can hop on an ADO bus to the ruins, and catch a return bus later in the day. Tips: Bring lots of water, a big hat, and sunscreen. This is one of the hottest sites – there are almost no trees for cover, so you’ll be really glad you brought a hat! You can combine your visit to the ruins with one of the many beautiful cenotes nearby. Uxmal Why Visit: Uxmal is considered one of the most important ruins, yet is surprisingly little-visited. It is located further inland than most of the other popular sites,and is representative of the Puuc style of architecture. The buildings and carvings are unique to this area, and make for an interesting comparison to the styles at Chichen Itza or the Tulum ruins. The layout of the ancient city is also different than many other ruins. Instead of being arranged geometrically, it’s arranged according to astronomical events. How to Get to Uxmal: Uxmal is located only 62km south of Merida, so it makes for a very easy day trip. You can drive yourself on the highway if you’ve rented a car. You can also easily arrange a tour from the city. The third option is to take the Sunday bus from Merida which stops at all the minor Puuc ruins (see below), as well as Uxmal. This is what I did, and I thought it was a great and efficient way to see all these ruins, including the more off-the-beaten path smaller ruins, in one day. The Sunday bus leaves at 8am from the TAME station in Merida. You can find more info here . Tips : If you don’t have your own transportation, take the Sunday Puuc route bus! And as always, bring a hat, sunscreen, and water! Puuc Route Why Visit the Puuc Ruins: These are very overlooked ruins because the sites are small, but I found them super interesting! Many of them had very interesting carvings, cool building layouts, and interesting locations. Some were tucked in the jungle, while others were more in the open. Here’s a breakdown on the 4 smaller Puuc sites: Labna : Labna is a small ruin with interesting carvings and columns. My favorite part was a partially unexcavated ruin in the back. There is a square geometric structure with a unique flat section at the top. It’s atop an unexcavated pyramid. There is also a pretty and unique archway. The structure is super unique! X-Lapak : X-Lapak is very small, but has a very interesting design. The main temple has distinct and complex geometric shapes across the top half of the temple. This site is less restored than others, so it’s in a bit of a “crumbling” state. This makes for an interesting ambiance though and allows you to see what it might look like when a temple is discovered. Sayil : This was my favorite of the smaller Puuc ruins. The main temple is pretty huge and impressive. It is 3 distince floors/tiers with lots of regal columns and staircases. It feels like a mix of a Mayan ruin and a Roman ruin. The pink/red stones also are pretty and unique Kabah : Kabah is a big open site with lots of large connected structures. You can climb around and across them. There are great views on top as well as a section with lots of interesting carved masks. There are lots of interesting carvings here and nooks &amp; crannies to explore. How to Get to the Puuc Ruins: As with Uxmal, you have three options to get here. You can drive yourself if you have rented a car – all the sites are on the same route and close together. You can follow this map . You can also take a tour from any agency in Merida. The third option is to take the Sunday Puuc route bus that leaves from the TAME station in Merida at 8am. This will take you to all 4 of the above Puuc ruins, as well as Uxmal at the end. See here for more info. Tips: Don’t miss these small but interesting sites! You’ll get a look into Mayan life during the classical period, and most likely have the sites mostly to yourself. Taking the Sunday bus is a great way to see these off-the-beaten path sites if you’re short on time or don’t have your own transport. Many of these sites have some shade, but as always bring a hat, sunscreen and water! Coba Why Visit: This is one of my favorite sites to visit in this area for a couple reasons. The best way to see this large and spread out site is by bicycle! You can rent bikes as soon as you arrive, and it’s sooo fun to cruise around this jungley area. There is so much to see here – tons of small little ruins tucked into lush jungle here and there, plus a super tall pyramid that you can climb to the top and have an amazing view for miles and miles over the jungle canopy. How to Get to Coba: This site is so easy to get to from Tulum, that it surprises me that more people don’t visit! It’s a straight shot on the highway inland from Tulum. If you have your own car, it should take you less than an hour. You could also arrange a tour with an agency in Tulum. It’s also super easy to take an ADO bus from Tulum pueblo to the ruins. This is how we got there. Buses leave every day in the morning. Tips: Rent a bike! It’s definitely the best way to get around this huge site, and also the most fun. You’ll beat the heat as you cruise around. As always, bring a hat, sunscreen and water. The little taquerias and comedors outside the gates are pretty good for a snack after your explorations. I definitely recommend climbing the big pyramid for amazing views and photo ops. Just keep in mind that these steps are suuuper steep, so if you’re afraid of heights, it might be challenging to get back down (though there is a rope to hold on to as you descend). Tulum Why Visit: The Tulum ruins definitely win for having the most beautiful location of all the ruins. Their placement on the cliffs overlooking some of the most beautiful white sand and turquoise water beaches on the coast is breathtaking. The ruins are pretty and impressive too. They are not the biggest individual buildings, but the site is fairly large, with interesting ruins here and there. How to Get to the Tulum Ruins: These ruins are incredibly easy to visit if you’re staying in Tulum. You can drive the few minutes from the town or the hotel zone on the beach. Or you can easily take a taxi from either location. A third option is bike there. I’ve done this on a couple of occasions and think it’s a really fun way to take in the jungle surroundings. Bike rentals are super common in Tulum, so you’re hotel will likely have them available, and if not there are tons of other bike rental shops. If you’re biking from town, you can take the highway until you reach the turnoff for the entrance. Or you can take the scenic route. It’s a bit longer, but more pleasant. You can take the paved bike/walking path from town to the beach, and then take the quieter beach road to the entrance. It’s also fun to stop on the way at any of the many hotels and restaurants for a cold beer or a snack. There are also a couple beautiful beaches along this stretch with public access. Lock up your bike and go for a refreshing dip before continuing on your way! If you are biking, try to do it earlier or later in the day to beat the heat. Take breaks and drink water! If you’re not staying in Tulum, there will still be many tours available from Cancun and Playa del Carmen. Tips: If you’re looking for an affordable hotel in Tulum that’s super cute, check this one out . You’ll also get a more authentic experience spending a few nights in town. Even though these ruins are right by the sea, it can get incredibly hot here. If possible, I’d recommend to go early. They are also quite a popular site, so going early may help you beat the crowd! Pictures will also be nicer if you avoid the harsh light of midday. If you go during green/rainy season, the foliage will be lush. There isn’t a lot of shade here, so definitely a good idea to have a hat, sunscreen, and water. Bring a bathing suit, there is a beach you can access through a staircase inside the ruins. With how hot and sweaty you will be, you’ll most likely want to jump into the refreshing water! Visiting any of these ruins is fun and adds a lot of cultural context and history to your trip to the Yucatan Peninsula. If you’re able to visit all 5 sites, you’ll come away with a much richer understanding of the region!"https://hippie-inheels.com/mexico-city-neighborhood-guide-where-to-stay-for-your-travel-style/,mexico,"Mexico City Neighborhood Guide: Where to Stay For Your Travel Style If you haven’t heard, Mexico City has moved past the stereotype of being dirty and dangerous. It’s a giant dynamic city with heaps of culture, pretty historic buildings, and some of the best food in the world. Mexico City Neighborhood Guide It’s also an easy flight from the US and Canada and has a low cost of living in comparison to those countries. Check Kiwi for your flights! I visited this city twice last year and loved it so much I came back this year to live for two and half months. I’ve spent time in many of the prettiest, hippest, and most attractive neighborhoods – they’re all great in their own way. But if you only have a few days or a week for your vacation, you’ll want to stay in the neighborhood that best matches your travel style. Don’t let misconceptions about this city intimidate you. Do your research about Mexico City travel , use common sense, and enjoy all the things this awesome city has to offer! Read on to find out which neighborhood you should stay in on your trip to Mexico City ! Roma/Condesa Roma and Condesa are the two hippest neighborhoods in the city. If you like to be among the young, artistic movers and shakers in a city, than this is the place to be. Both neighborhoods are full of cute cafes, trendy boutiques, vibey mezcal bars, and pretty parks. These neighborhoods border each other and have a lot of similarities, but there are a few subtle differences. Condesa is a bit more upscale and developed, while Roma still has new places popping up all the time, and a slightly younger/artier crowd A street corner in pretty Condesa. A fun and colorful mural in Roma. The flipside is that these neighborhoods can be a bit “touristy” – having a higher concentration of travelers and expats. Restaurants and stores also tend to be a bit pricier than other neighborhoods. Coyoacan If you’re looking for a more “authentic” Mexican neighborhood as well gorgeous  colorful buildings, Coyoacan is your best bet. This is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Mexico City. It has a very artsy feel – it’s the home to the excellent Frida Kahlo museum. Yes this church is crooked! But also colorful. You could wander around every day and take pictures of vibrant houses, historic churches, cobblestone alleys, and other pretty things. The two central parks are very picturesque and popular gathering places. Coyoacan is also very lively. You can walk the streets in the center any night, and you’ll find lots of people out, enjoying some street food, watching performers in the central parks, or having a mezcal on a terrace. While this neighborhood does receive its fair share of tourists, not many of them actually stay here (often just visiting the Frida museum) so it has an authentic Mexican feel, while being very safe and beautiful. The main thing to keep in mind is that Coyoacan is a bit south of the Centro, and most of the main tourist attractions. It’s well connected by the Metro, and there are plenty of Ubers, but you’ll have to plan your time and travel to reach the Centro, Roma/Condesa, Chapultepec Park, etc. Centro The Centro is jam packed with great attractions, awesome street food, and tons of action. This might be a good choice for you if you have a very short stay. You’ll be able to fit in visiting important landmarks like the Zocalo, the Palacio Nacional, Bellas Artes, The Museo Mural Diego Rivera, the Torre Latinoamericana, the Templo Mayor, etc. The cons of staying in the Centro are that it becomes very quiet at night, and can be an unsafe place to wander around after dark. If you’re not looking to party at night, this shouldn’t be a problem, or you can also take an Uber back to your door from wherever you head out to in the evening. Polanco Polanco is the most upscale neighborhood in Mexico City. If you’re a fan of quiet, well maintained and beautiful streets – this is a good choice for you. Some of the most well-renowned upscale restaurants are here, like critically acclaimed Pujol. The famous Soumaya museum is also here, which you’ll definitely want to visit for some great photo ops of the unique architecture. Polanco is bordered by the giant and pretty Chapultepec Park. You can easy walk to the park, enjoy the greenery, go for a run, and visit some of the great museums here like the Anthropology Museum and the Chapultepec Castle (yes it really is a castle!). Keep in mind that Polanco is upscale, so prices here will be higher than anywhere else in the city. It is also a little bit west of the action, so you will most likely need to take transportation to get to neighborhoods or sites outside of Polanco and Chapultepec park.   There is something for everyone in this giant city of over 20 million people. These are only 5 of the neighborhoods, but they are the prettiest, safest, and most equipped for tourists. You can’t go wrong with any of them, but if you pick the one that best fits your personality and travel style, you’ll enjoy your trip to the fullest!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-marrakech/,morocco,"What makes Marrakech a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? While Marrakech may not be a glamorous city on first sight – think farting mules and raggedy streets everywhere – it is an imperial city after all. The city is full of history and beautiful architecture, but it isn’t showy, something I really like. Palaces and mosques are quite literally clad in marble, but nothing feels too overwhelming or decadent. It also has a very sensual side, a smell of orange blossoms and roses to everything. Think Arabian Nights mixed with French laissez-faire, a mix that already enticed Yves Saint Laurent who I think is the best company you can seek when it comes to the ultimate luxury. What 5-star hotel is the best in Marrakech? I think there are few other cities with more 5-star hotels and riads than Marrakech so you will have a hard time going wrong with your choice. However, THE 5-star hotel is without a doubt the Royal Mansour . The hotel combines ultra luxury with the very best traditional Moroccan craftsmanship. They have basically created a palace for you to live in. Here you don’t have a room, you stay in one of 53 riads which are all connected by hidden, underground corridors for the staff so you get the utmost privacy. Exclusive airport pick-up with no wait at immigration and a midnight swim in their glass domed pool has me shivering in anticipation – I am hoping to go in April. What about boutique hotels in Marrakech, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Depending on their price range I would either send them to Chambres d’Amis or El Fenn. Chambres d’Amis is one of the most charming, cool riads in town. Quirky, cute rooms, plenty of tortoises to play with and some of the best homemade food. All that for amazing rates and three minutes away from the Jemaa el Fna. If you want to splurge a little more I recommend El Fenn . Vanessa Branson, sister of Richard Branson, has created an art and design lovers’ paradise with plenty of Moroccan charm. Make sure to check out the awesome hotel shop and the little pool. Whenever I stay there I usually don’t even venture into the city anymore, it is that fabulous. Are there any fun activities in Marrakech for the adventurous traveler? Getting lost in the medina and seeing the snake charmers on the Jemaa el Fna is probably all the adventure you will need. However, if you want to get a bit more of an adrenalin kick you will need to get out of the city. Head towards the Atlas Mountains and half an hour outside of town you can go quad biking in the desert. The landscape here is quite bizarre but also absolutely stunning. You won’t be going over sand dunes, but ride over gravel roads and hills. Think moon landscape and you are the pilot of your own lunar rover! Where are the best hang outs during the day in Marrakech? The heart of the city is the Jemaa el Fna, the great square in the medina, and while it only really comes to life in the evening, it is worth a stroll during the day too. Watch the snake charmers and visit the tooth seller, grab a freshly squeezed orange juice and soak up the atmosphere in one of the many surrounding cafes. From here head into the souks, the main markets, and just get lost. There is no better place for window shopping once you get the knack of telling off the very pushy vendors. If you need a little break, head towards the Maison de la Photographie, one of Marrakech’s best galleries in the heart of the souks, a perfect place to relax a little. If you need some greenery, I recommend a stroll through Jardin Majorelle, also called the Yves Saint Laurent garden. Here you will find an impressive cacti collection and the most amazing Berber museum amongst splashes of blue and yellow. A paradise for Instagram, fashion and nature fans alike. From here head to Cafe de la Poste for a colonial style lunch with a glass of local wine. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Marrakech and what are their best dishes? For a glamorous date in Marrakech, I would eat at the Le Marocain at the La Mamounia (another great option for a 5-star hotel in case the Royal Mansour is booked out). I ate there once during my stay and it was honestly the best meal I’ve had in Morocco. They offer traditional Moroccan cuisine with a contemporary twist. Think lamb meatballs filled with foie gras or pastilla with lobster. The restaurant is also located deep within the Mamounia gardens, which are insanely beautiful. Perfect for a romantic sunset stroll before dinner and moonlight lit digestive walk after. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best in Marrakech? Honestly, most Moroccan sweets and desserts are not that exciting to me. I usually prefer fresh fruit instead of their very sugary pastries. However, the restaurant Nomad offers not only amazing views over the souks and cool tunes but also amazing homemade vervain and argan oil ice cream. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Marrakech? I prefer Marrakech more for interior shopping than for clothing. Best place for that are of course the souks. If you feel overwhelmed by the choices and the not so shy vendors, I recommend hiring a shopping guide. He will take you to places according to your interests, help you with negotiations, and keep the vendors at bay. If you rather want set prices and some calm (though calm is relative in Marrakech) I recommend the stores at Terrace des Épices for labels like Lalla and La Maison Bahira as well as the boutiques Chabi Chic and 33 Majorelle, the ultimate concept store. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Marrakech? I think Marrakech’s true spa culture is best experienced with a traditional hammam. Here you will be engulfed in warm steam and water, soak in black olive soap and then be scrubbed with a peeling glove until your skin glows. Hammams in Morocco are washing ritual and community hall in one where locals come to get clean and to chat. Public hammams are everywhere and while far from luxurious, they are an experience not to be missed. Talk about an adventure! Just know that you will survive and that you will come out cleaner than you have ever been before. I usually just ask the staff at my accommodation for a recommendation. Make sure to tell them you want a public hammam – insert incredulous look on their faces – yes, not the fancy tourist one. In case you are not brave enough (yet) to brave the real hammam experience go to Le Bains Bleu for a more luxurious tourist version. Time for a great sunset view in Marrakech… where would you go? Again, Jemaa el Fna! Head to the iconic Cafe de France or any other of the surrounding rooftop bars. I am using the term bar loosely as you won’t get alcoholic drinks at most of them. However, the views over the roofs of Marrakech and the square coming to life at dawn is spectacular. Go here for Maghrib, the sunset prayer, for a concert of prayer calls from all surrounding mosques and you are in for a treat. A truly haunting and beautiful experience while the city is drenched in gold. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Many places in the medina will not offer alcohol. If you don’t mind, I recommend staying close to the square for its vibrant atmosphere in the evening or Cafe Clock that offers music and cultural events every day. For a truly great cocktail, I’d go to La Mamounia’s Churchill bar that has an amazing cocktail menu. However, my favorite is to simply get a bottle of local wine or beer at a grocery store and drink it on top of the roof. Really any roof. With views like this, I don’t care much whether I’m drinking champagne or water – would you?"https://hippie-inheels.com/foods-to-try-in-morocco/,morocco,"Crazy and Delicious Foods to Try in Morocco If you’re like me then trying local food when you travel is at the top of the list of “things to do in___”. There are a lot of unique foods to try in Morocco and I’m going to share with you the ones I tried while on a walking food tour with a company called Marrakech Food Tours . I am so happy to have taken this food tour, because prior to it, I was SO disappointed with the food we tried in Morocco. My friend and I found that it was either touristy-Moroccan (not what you would get at home or even at a Moroccan restaurant abroad) or it was International (French mostly, but not the best international and very touristy). We thought wow what’s going on here… It was bizarre since both of us had Moroccan food outside Morocco and liked it. The guide of the tour explained to us that you don’t find a lot of good Moroccan food in Marrakesh and other cities. Reason being, Moroccan people don’t eat out much and when they do they want International food since they eat Moroccan at home. They wouldn’t pay for a Moroccan meal because they will have a better one at home. It’s a bummer for us foreigners visiting but thankfully on this tour, the local guide (who has an American blogger wife, Amanda ) took us to the secret spots. I highly recommend it! On your tour make sure to talk with them via email before if you want more “freaky” foods or if you want to avoid that completely. You can customize to some extent. You can follow them on Facebook . Foods to Try in Morocco Sheep Head Yes, that’s a head… a sheep’s head to be exact! We saw this outside stop #1 on our food tour. How is it cooked? In the hole below while it’s all still connected. They actually put the entire body down in there. I tried it and did NOT like it. It tasted very gamey to me and I just couldn’t deal! In our group just one person liked it. We gave the eyeball to the tour guide. Tangia The other parts of the sheep that came out of that hole were very tasty, though. One dish was called tangia (not tagine the common dish). Tangia is just in Marrakesh and is a specialty. Slow cooked lamb Below was the slow cooked lamb which was just insane. I loved it but what’s not to love? It didn’t have a Moroccan flavor to it that I noticed unless you did it in the spices provided, which I think was a cumin salt mixture. Olives I’m not a fan of olives except maybe a green one hidden in my tagine that I don’t notice much… but they just are too flavorful for me. They are meant to be awesome here though and the group went crazy trying all the different styles of olives. I did try the local jalapeno and damn is it way more spicy than the ones in the U.S. Sardine Sandwich How bizarre is that? Okay, to me it is. They make “meatballs” out of the sardines and most of the group said  “are you sure this isn’t beef?”  because it just didn’t taste like fish. For me, I knew what it was and mentally couldn’t get over it because I don’t like sardines or any little fishies. It had tomato, spicy sauce, onions, and olive. Actually, if it was beef without the olive I would have liked it… but then that’s just a meatball marinara sandwich lol I’m too American for my own good! Maybe add some cheese ;) Moroccan Donuts Like all donuts, I do not discriminate and I love this donut. It tasted just like the homemade ones my mom used to make from the Pillsbury cans of biscuit dough. They put honey on it which was delicious. The only thing I wished for was some powdered sugar but that’s because I’m a fatty at heart. The donut was great but then he went and did this yummy mess of a dish where he put the egg into the dough while it cooked and pushed more dough on top. What comes out is “eggy bread” as the Brit’s call it or similar to “French toast” for the Americans (without the powdered sugar). Funnily the French influenced Moroccan life and maybe the food, so I asked if this was brought by the French or if the Moroccans taught the French (I mean why IS it called French toast?) but the guide wasn’t sure. Cookies and Bread In Morocco, they have bread guys who do the baking and the locals used to bring their fresh dough to him. He was the pro. As time has gone on, people have gotten their own ovens. But in the heat of the summer when they don’t want their house too hot they still take the dough to the local community oven. One story I liked was how these local bakers knew everyone in town so they were the marriage arrangers. They would hear from families dropping off bread about their son or daughter who needed to be married and he could arrange. Before those times, women used to go the hammam and see the young girls naked to see who would make a good wife for their son! How weird is that lol … but times have changed and it’s no longer happening. Spleen Nope didn’t try it, sorry guys! I mean it looked rubbery and it’s an organ. I’d already risked it with the sheep’s head and just couldn’t. Escargot AKA snails. Do you think I tried it? Nope, not even for the sake of research! It was a packed bar though with so many locals eating bowls of snails. I guess this is another French connection. Couscous We later went to the most famous (secret) little couscous which is made with love for hours. The process they used was really insane and puts instant couscous to shame. This was so tasty but we were pretty stuffed so couldn’t eat enough. We felt terrible leaving so much behind! The mint tea that is always served in Morocco was served with this. So tasty. Dessert &amp; Smoothies The desserts here are very buttery and sugary, which is obviously a good thing! They each have a similar base of butter, but their own flavors added. I loved the pecan one! The smoothies are unique here like avocado, milk, and dates. Not really my thing so didn’t have a smoothie. I know it seems like I didn’t try much, but I’m more of a meat eater! When I travel alone or with a friend, I love to sign up for group things every so often. I am not one to get SO excited over new things and I really enjoy seeing other people’s reactions to what they are seeing and trying. I like to hear what questions they have. That actually helps me to learn about places because I might not think to ask the questions myself. The tour was great and the group was very fun to get to know."https://hippie-inheels.com/best-morocco-2-week-morocco-itinerary/,morocco,"How to “Do” Morocco in Under 2 Weeks – Your 2 Week Morocco Itinerary Morocco was a trip that was decided on a little last-minute. I had to squeeze it and that meant we had just under two weeks in Morocco. With this 2 week Morocco itinerary you’ll see what I thought would be the best of Morocco. Of course, you can’t “do” a country in two weeks but with this Morocco itinerary, you’ll definitely see a lot from mountains to desert, cities, beaches, and tiny blue villages. Your 2 Week Morocco Itinerary I suggest flying into one airport and out another. Flights here from Europe on budget airlines are so affordable that it’s not worth wasting days traveling via train to get back to your arrival airport. For this itinerary, you’ll fly into Fes and out of Marrakesh. I used Kiwi.com  because with the change in airports and wanting to search budget airlines, this was the only site that made it possible. When flying budget with check-in luggage always book ahead. You sometimes can do it on the airline site and other times you need to do it on the booking site. You will get a better price paying ahead than at the counter. Make sure you have travel insurance ahead of time. I book with World Nomads; here’s an article about how they work and why I use them. Make sure you read up my other articles about how to dress in Morocco and what to buy while you’re here. silk jacket 2 Weeks Morocco Itinerary 2 days in Chefchaouen This is the blue town you’ve seen all over Pinterest . It’s magical. It’s beautiful . It’s completely unforgettable AND it’s my favorite place in Morocco. People are chilled here. Might be to do with the huge hash industry. silk jacket When you fly into Fes you can choose to stay there and then go to Chefchaouen but I suggest going straight up to Chefchaouen from the airport. From here on out, you’ll then just be working your way down to the ending point in Marrakesh to fly out. You’ll be tired from the flight, so it’s good to just get it over with! You can grab a taxi from the airport for about 70 bucks each way. Here’s my guide to Chefchaouen which includes where to stay, what to do, where to eat, and of course what to buy. Here’s a photo gallery with SO much inspiration to visit. orange silk coat silk trench coat 3 days in Fes Fes is next. It’s known as the laid-back version of Marrakesh. I did not find that to be true. We did get better prices here on rugs and leather poufs than in Marrakesh though. If you’re coming to shop, this is the spot. You’ll want to visit the tanneries which is where leather gets made. It’s not for the faint of heart. It really smells as well. The best thing about Fes was our hotel, Karawan Riad . It’s commonly listed as one of the best design hotels in the WORLD. You can read my review of Karawan Riad here. The medina in Fes is the largest and oldest in the world, dating to the 800’s. You WILL get lost. People here are more agressive than what we found elsewhere. Do not let someone “show you the way” unless you want to pay them. If you don’t pay, it could get very bad. We told someone no, we would find our way as we are from India and knew this style of hustling. He followed us anyway and once we reached our destination they had to threaten to call police and eventually when we left (he was waiting) escort us to a taxi while PHYSICALLY holding this man back. The NE of the medina is the coolest tannery called Chouara Tannery. Your hotel can show you on a map. Again, we encountered people trying to scam us here. You can see the tannery from above for free. If you go down the steps where they invite you as if it’s the entrance, they want money. From here there is a famous rug shop here, Chez Hamidou. You can get good deals but I found the bargaining here aggressive and almost left with nothing. Its not like India at all where negotiating happens with a smile. It is recommended by every hotel to have a guide. We were there for serious shopping so didn’t want a guide (it makes you look richer than you might be) but man would one have been helpful on many occasions. Taxis are VERY cheap. 2 Euro to get almost anywhere. They don’t go in the medina. It is VERY worthwhile to exit via a medina gate and get a taxi to the gate of your hotel or next spot to visit in the medina rather than getting lost inside. Keep in mind *NO* top restaurants in Morocco are cheap. Finding affordable, good, food is a struggle. I recommend going to Cafe Clock for lunch and shopping in this area. It’s on the West side of the Medina. If you’re thinking that this doesn’t look  great  keep in mind good food is hard to find (we tried so hard) and this kind of the best you’ll get unless someone invites you into their home. Try out Dar Roumana for dinner but you have to make a reservation. The fill up fast! Try out lunch at the Ruined Garden . It’s near Cafe Clock which I mentioned above. Visit the Kairaouine Mosque. For sightseeing this is probably the #1 thing to do but non-Muslims cannot enter. You can just peek inside. “Fez is still the most intact, least modernised medina in the Arab world and one of the largest car-free urban spaces on the planet, but it’s changing. Sixty years ago, the writer Paul Bowles met people here who had never seen a car. That’s not to say there were no cars in Fez, but they were in the Ville Nouvelle, the new town that sits above the ancient city, and those people had made it a point of honour not to walk out of the gates to see the newfangled contraptions. Such determination has shaped Fez, making it one of the last bastions of the medieval world.” CN Traveler 5 days in Marrakesh Getting to Marrakesh: take the train from Fes. It’s 7 hours. It’s cheap. It’s VERY comfortable and totally safe in my opinion. Trains here were built by the French and are notoriously on time and clean. We went second class. It was not bad at all. A taxi will cost you a fortune. Compared to Fes the medina here is mall, but the city as a whole is very big. There is more “tourist” stuff to do here than Fes. I wrote a FULL guide to 5 days in Marrakesh . For people having only 5 days, I recommended they go to the desert just for a day trip. With two weeks in Morocco I recommend that you do the desert overnight. Marrakesh is fantastic and there are SO many great hotels. I stayed at 3 and wrote reviews on all of them: El Fenn hotel review . Located in the medina, FANTASTIC hotel. Has a few dipping pools. Riad Star hotel review . Located in the medina, a little more affordable, going through renovations has a dipping pool. Les Cinq de Djellabas review . Favorite hotel here, just outside of town. 10 private huts that are designed amazingly. HUGE pool. 2 days in the Desert So you could possible get out to the Sahara, but it’s 10 hours each way so it’s a lot of drivig just to stay one night. Whatever you book, arrange that the transport is in the price- it should be anyway. Because of that, I recommend going somewhere closer to Marrkesh, not the Sahara, but still  desert so that you can have the experience without getting worn out. If you have more time or want to chop off Essaouria from the list, then go for the Sahara! If camels and deserts are what you are looking forward to, you could definitely consider going to the Sahara and not Essaouria. I went to Scarabeo Desert Camp which was a boutique property and definitely a “glamping” experience. You can read my review there. They picked us up from our hotel and dropped us back. 2 days Essaouira Personally, I didn’t make it here as I had just under two weeks (12 days) but if you have the extra time you can do 1 or 2 days here as they even offer day trips from Marrakesh. It’s a 2.5 hour drive with a taxi which I’d guess would cost about 35 dollars based on our other long distance journeys (Fes to Chefchaouen). You can take the train for just 10 dollars. This is my favorite app to see what options you have: Rome2Rio . The prices listed for taxi are high though here. I checked routes I took and I got much better rates than what is listed. Here’s a shopping guide to Essaouira . What is missing that you should add if you have time? Casablanca.  It’s called the Miami of Morocco because of it’s Art Deco. It’s a more modern city. Tangier. Coastal town. Friends say it’s one of their favorites. It’s a melting pot here and ancient. South coastal towns.  My boyfriend used to live in the South which is were all the surfing happens. It’s a big drive and if you go down here you’ll want to stay awhile. For me, it’ll be a separate trip. Sahara.  Like I said above, with 10 days you might not go all the way to the Sahara but you can still have desert experiences."https://hippie-inheels.com/moroccan-desert-experience-closer-to-marrakesh/,morocco,"Get the Moroccan Desert Experience Without the 10 Hour Ride to the Sahara The Scarabeo (Stone) Camp in Marakesh was a stunning and unforgettable experience that I highly recommend. Here’s a look at what Scarabeo Camp Marrakesh can offer and why it’s proximity is so important with getting the Moroccan desert experience closer to Marrakesh, when other camps are 10 hours away. black kimono How to Get the Moroccan Desert Experience Closer to Marrakesh When my friend Tia and I recently went to Morocco for 10 days, I planned it out and limited us to just Chefchaouen, Fes, and Marrakesh. I wanted to go to the coast and the Atlas mountains but there wasn’t time if I really wanted to relax. By the way: the reason these photos look like they are set up for fashion shoot, is because they were! My friend needed photos of her new fashion line for her lookbook so we shot them here. green dress I hadn’t considered the desert to be honest. I had been on a camel safari in Jaisalmer, India  and in Wadi Rum, Jordan . They were similar experiences although the desert in Wadi Rum was much more red. I’d just been in the dust of Israel’s Golan Heights and basically, live in red dust in Goa. While I love being in the sand at the beach, I’m not usually stoked to be covered in dust with no water around. Burning Man wouldn’t be for me. Tia said to me she hadn’t been on a camel or even been to a desert. I was like WHAT!? I would have planned something! So, last-minute while we were already in Morocco I got us booked in at Scarabeo Camp but just for the day since I already had the hotels booked. The camp offers transport to and from the city of Marrakesh and it took us just 30 minutes to get there in Douar el Mouilah. Considering it’s so close to the city it was surprising how middle-of-nowhere it seemed at the camp. orange silk dress black kimono  &amp; green dress I think one of the biggest benefits of this camp is the proximity to the city. We didn’t want to take time from our schedule to go to the desert and most camps I found online were about 10 hours outside the city in the Sahara. That’s why I had originally written them off. The difference between this camp and a Sahara camp It was such a blessing to get to come to this camp last-minute and just have to give up one of our 5 days in Marrakesh. According to people who’ve been to both, this is nothing compared to the Sahara. This is the desert but not the “true Sahara experience”. If you don’t have two days to use on travel to and from the desert, this is the place for you. silk trench coat tiger print pantsuit This camp is at the base of the Atlas Mountains which makes it a really unique desert to see. It was nothing like India or Jordan. I loved seeing the mountains in the background. Because it wasn’t so far in the desert, there were clouds and it was just stunning. Scarabeo Camp Marrakesh There are a handful of things to do at the camp including eating delicious Moroccan food, doing 4 wheel trips, riding camels, and of course taking photos! Like the other posts I’ve shared on this Moroccan trip, Tia had brought clothes from her new line for us to wear and get some cool photos in for her Instagram (which I conveniently used for mine, too!) orange silk dress They have dune buggies you can ride. They also have Fantasia shows which are Moroccan horse shows. You can do yoga here and get a massage. You do need to book activities ahead of time. This is a true glamping in Morocco experience and a chic boutique desert camp. I found this place on Instagram and saw so many fashion bloggers and lifestyle bloggers choosing to stay here. It has that “look” to it that just makes you want to visit! Information on Scarabeo Camp There are 7 tents and 3 suites on the camp property. In the tents and suites are “berber” style showers which means they give you a bucket of hot and one of cold water. There are two common showers you can use. The food here is incredible. Let them know ahead of time dietary needs as there is no kitchen here. They get the food from local families. You can expect to pay around $200 per night to stay here."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/04/hbo-game-thrones-filming-locations-tourist-spots/,morocco,"15 Game of Thrones Filming Locations that You Can Visit It’s that time of the year again! You know that another Game of Thrones season has begun when your Facebook news feed is flooded with cheers of excitement, cries of anger, and death threats for friends who are posting spoilers. It is not difficult to understand why HBO’s highly entertaining and often wildly brutal adaptation of the George RR Martin novels has reached the legendary status in pop culture. It has all the right ingredients: compelling characters, convincing production, unpredictable plot twists, and the right amount of fantasy. And dragons! Put it all together and you get a weekly serving of wonder. Brutal at times, but still pretty mindblowing. But there’s one more thing that always captivates me about this phenomenal hit. On the Season 6 premiere, for instance, when the khalasar made their way to Khal Jhaqo with Daenerys Targaryen in tow, I was so drawn to the arid landscape that surrounded them that I googled it right away. Bardenas Reales in Spain, it turned out. I have been so fascinated with GoT’s choices of filming locations that I have come up with a mission: visit as many of them as I can. The first that I set foot on was Essaouira in Morocco, which was where all Astapor scenes were shot (including that part where Khaleesi freed the Unsullied and ordered them to kill their masters). And when I backpack across Europe later this year, I’m certainly making stops in Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Spain.       So I decided to make a list of the fictional places in the series and their real-life counterparts, where they were primarily filmed. But before we begin, some notes: This list covers exterior shots only. Many of the interior sequences were actually done elsewhere. For example, Dobrovnik’s streets and coastal walls are used mainly for King’s Landing, but interior shots (Red Keep, Iron Throne, etc.) are done in sets in Northern Ireland. This is not 1:1. King’s Landing may be filmed mainly in Dubrovnik, but they also took supplementary footage of Essaouira and Malta as the Westeros capital. Dubrovnik also stood in for the City of Qarth in Season 2. Many of these sites have been digitally modified or enhanced by the show. Winterfell, for example, is almost unrecognizable as Castle Ward. This is not complete. I will update this as the series moves forward. Now that we got the caveats out of the way, here it is: a Game of Thrones fan’s travel bucket list! WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland 9. Pentos: Malta 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia The ancient port city of Dubrovnik has seen a steady increase in tourism since they first used it to depict King’s Landing in Season 1. Executive Producer David Benioff said, “The first time we saw Dubrovnik, I was in shock, because the whole city really looked the way we pictured King’s Landing looking.” 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland Castle Ward tower digitally modified to create Winterfell The vast 1000-acre grounds surrounding Castle Ward has hosted the production team as they bring to life many of the series’ key moments, including scenes featuring Winterfell, seat of the House Stark and capital of the North. Much of the first 2 seasons took advantage of the sheer size of its grassy farmyard, perfect for army camp sequences, and ancient structures including Audley’s Castle. 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland The Magheramorne Quarry is an abandoned limestone quarry in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is where the Castle Black set was installed. (It has also been used as Hardhome and the city walls of King’s Landing in Season 2’s Blackwater episode.) It is currently not accessible to the public, but there are pending plans of reopening it as a mountain biking center. Fingers crossed. 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland Iceland as Wildling and White Walker territory Iceland in real life Most of the events north of the Wall of Westeros are realized in Iceland. This includes the glacier at Snæfellsjökull (I don’t even know how to pronounce that properly) which was used as the Fist of the First Men; Mývatn Lake, a frozen lava lake close to the town of Akureyri, which was where Mance Rayder’s wildling group dwelled; and Grjótagjá Cave, where Jon Snow and Ygritte had a very wet consummation of their love. 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain Alcázar of Seville as Sunspear in Dorne Alcázar of Seville in reality Dorne was actually what I was so excited to see on television. I just thought it had the most character. Dorne, the southernmost region of the Seven Kingdoms, in the books was actually inspired by medieval Spain, so it totally makes sense that they chose Seville as location, including Sunspear, seat of House Martell, which was actually the Alcázar of Seville in reality. This season, fans are also excited to see the Tower of Joy, which was said to be Castillo de Zafra, a 12th-century castle in Guadalajara. 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland Also known as “raised beach,” Ballintoy Harbor in County Antrim can take pride in being real-life Iron Islands. Images of this picturesque harbor were digitally enhanced to mimic the jaw-dropping seascape of Pyke and Lordsport. You remember that scene where Theon Greyjoy first meets his sister Yara? That was shot here. 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland Stannis Baratheon’s bailiwick is actually Downhill Strand, a beach destination in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It’s where Stannis and Melisandre set the Seven idols on fire and where Davos allowed Gendry to flee. 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland Kingsroad Do you remember when Arya, Yoren, Gendry, and Hot Pie were on the way to the Wall after escaping King’s Landing? Did you notice the beautiful avenue flanked with rows of eerie but beautiful trees? That’s the Dark Hedges of Armoy, which in the GoT world is Kingsroad. It is actually a road of beech trees, which according to Northern Ireland’s tourism website , were planted in the 18th century by the Stuart family “to impress visitors as they approached the entrance to their Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.” 9. Pentos: Malta See that arch in the background? That’s the Azure Window, a famous feature of the Maltese Island of Gozo. Azure Window IRL. And now we go all the way back to Season 1. The Mediterranean archipelago of Malta has been home to the GoT team for many days, too, mostly during the filming of Pentos. In particular, the 16th century Verdala Palace, the official summer residence of the Maltese President, stood in for the mansion of Illyrio Mopatis, the merchant-prince who sold Daenerys to Khal Drogo in marriage. The wedding feast then took place in Gozo Island, the second largest island in Malta. 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia Meereen, the largest city that Daenerys Targaryen has conquered and ruled so far, is the Croatian city of Split in real life. Situated on the coast of Dalmatia, this picturesque city faces the Adriatic Sea. Among the sites used in the series is the Diocletian’s Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site, whose cellars provided replacement for the underground passages in Meereen. 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia Šibenik, a quiet medieval town in Central Dalmatia, Croatia, made its GoT debut in Season 5 as the free city of Braavos, where Arya Stark found herself after sailing from Westeros and where the Iron Bank is located. 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco Essaouira as Astapor Essaouira in real life The port city of Essaouira along the Atlantic coast of Morocco serves as Astapor, one of the cities in Slaver’s Bay. Essaouira is where most scenes in Astapor was shot, including the unforgettable and iconic scene wherein Daenerys Targaryen bought and freed the Unsullied, and then ordered her dragons to attack. Dracarys! 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco Aït-Ben-Haddou as Yunkai Aït-Ben-Haddou IRL. Also in Morocco is the old city of Aït-Ben-Haddou, a fortified city on the edge of the great Sahara desert. It’s no stranger to movies as it has been the setting for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), and Prince of Persia (2010) among others. But in the GoT world, Aït-Ben-Haddou is Yunkai, aka Yellow City and one of the three great city-states in Slaver’s Bay. 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain Vaes Dothrak has yet to be featured, but rumor has it that the team tapped the exotic charms of Almeria, a city in Andalusia, Spain, for this. We’ll see in the coming episodes. 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Many places have been used to depict the many parts of Dothraki Sea, but in the Season 6 premiere, the place we casually refer to as “wherever the fuck Drogon dropped Daenerys” is Bardenas Reales, the 100,000-acre badlands in southeast Navarre, Spain.

Some weeks it will be a really fun  interview about packing, fashion, and fitness  so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it’ll be a  detailed   luxury guide  to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.  E-mail me if you’d like to be featured. A Luxury Guide to Kathmandu Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Kathmandu. My name is Elen, I’m an editor and writer who has just moved back to Kathmandu, Nepal. I lived here for almost a year in 2013-14, travelled here for five weeks in 2015, and have set up home here again recently—the joys of having location-independent work! South Asia is my favourite region of the world. Despite Kathmandu’s general dirtiness and apparent chaos, I love its atmosphere. The people are friendly and chilled out, and I’m always discovering new hidden corners of beauty and surprise. My blog, Wilderness Metropolis , focuses on travel in South Asia. What makes Kathmandu a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Nepal isn’t widely known as a luxury travel destination, but there plenty of high-end hotels, resorts, spas and boutiques around the country—and particularly in Kathmandu—to attract travellers who like a bit of luxury. Although Nepal is often overshadowed by its dominant neighbor India, Kathmandu is really very different from any Indian cities. Luxury hotels and other experiences are uniquely Nepali in design and flavor. What 5 star hotel is the best in Kathmandu? Dwarika’s Hotel , without a doubt. This 80+ room hotel was begun in the 1960s by Dwarika Das Shrestha, a local man who saw a lot of the Kathmandu Valley’s traditional Newari architectural heritage being destroyed through neglect. He started collecting artefacts such as window frames and intricate carvings, and promoted the traditional production of various handicrafts. Now, Dwarika’s Hotel looks like a beautiful Newari palace—such as those found in the Kathmandu or Patan Durbar Squares—and the enormous rooms are each different, and filled with antiques and other one-off, local touches. Although it is a 5-star hotel, there is nothing generic about it. What about boutique hotels in Kathmandu, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? For a small, homely atmosphere, I recommend Swotha Bed &amp; Breakfast in Patan. This part of the city doesn’t have as many hotels as Kathmandu-proper, so is much quieter at night and more intimate. Swotha Bed &amp; Breakfast is tucked down a lane just off Swotha Square, which used to be identifiable by its small temple, but which unfortunately fell down in the earthquake of April 2015. It’s not far from the main Patan Durbar Square and some lovely art, jewellery and crafts shops. The café downstairs, Café Swotha, is also my favourite place to take my laptop and write. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Kathmandu? Nepal is all about adventure travel, but you don’t have to go far outside Kathmandu to enjoy this. Many tour companies—which are concentrated in the Thamel district of Kathmandu—arrange day hikes to spots within the Kathmandu Valley. The Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park or Phulchoki, the highest peak of the Valley, are manageable day hikes for a bit of fresh(er) air and exercise. Where are the best hangouts during the day in Kathmandu? In Patan, the Patan Museum and Patan Durbar Square cannot be topped. You can first take a look around the museum to learn about the religious and architectural history of the Kathmandu Valley, then sit in the shade of one of the temples outside to contextualize what you’ve learnt. And the peaceful courtyard restaurant out the back of the museum does excellent dal bhat. In Kathmandu, the Garden of Dreams is a surprising respite from the overly touristy Thamel district. It is a beautifully landscaped garden with trimmed lawns, fountains, flowers and nooks and crannies to hide away in with a book. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Kathmandu and what are their best dishes? Although you wouldn’t have thought that you’d come to Kathmandu for the French food, everyone raves about Chez Caroline, in the Baber Mahal Revisited complex. It’s the hangout of French expats, so you know it must be authentic. Everything there is perfect, from the set-course weekend brunches to the crème caramel. You will not make a bad choice. And because you wouldn’t want to forget that you’re in Kathmandu, Chez Caroline is set within a courtyard of a renovated old palace. The brickwork and bronze sculptures are among the most beautiful and authentically Nepali that you will find anywhere in Kathmandu. The Baber Mahal Revisited complex is tucked a bit out of the way, so takes a little effort to get to (although it’s worth it!) From wherever you’re staying in Kathmandu, it will be a short taxi-ride away, so it is worth planning spending a leisurely lunch or dinner here. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Kathmandu. The best things to buy in Kathmandu are the handicrafts (especially made out of paper, bronze and cashmere), Tibetan paintings and silver jewellery. Although you can buy almost anything in Thamel, it is overly touristy and the shopping experience isn’t the most luxurious. A better plan is to combine lunch at Chez Caroline (above) with window-shopping the upmarket boutiques also in the Baber Mahal complex. Check out the prices and quality of items there, although I wouldn’t recommend buying anything there. The better-value, better-variety fair-trade shops along Pulchowk Road in Patan are what you should aim for to buy a variety of handicrafts, from pashmina shawls to brass singing bowls. For jewellery and Tibetan thangka paintings, the lanes of old Patan, near the Patan Durbar Square, are a treat. The best jewellery can be found in the smallest shops, tucked behind blue and green shutters, and probably not very well lit. You will need to bargain, but nobody pushes the hard sell here, so the shopping experience is fun and memorably Kathmandu. What is the best salon or spa in Kathmandu? The luxury hotels provide good massage and spa services, but my favourite is Wellness Spa, above Café Cheeno in Patan. It can be found easily because it’s on the corner by the bus stand, before you go through the Patan gate. Wellness Spa is understated, but has a loyal following of expat clients. Time for a great sunset view in Kathmandu… where would you go? The sun sets early in Kathmandu, year-round. But if you’re lucky (and in town during the right season) the mountains will come out on display in the late afternoon and early evening, around sun-set. The best place to catch this is from a rooftop bar, such as Mezze by Roadhouse, on Durbar Marg. Overlooking the old Narayanhiti Palace, if the conditions are right, this upmarket bar is the place to catch a perfect Himalayan sunset. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks. Kathmandu is not known for its classy bars, I’m afraid, but you can definitely have a lot of fun in the city if you like dancing or loud live music. If you’ve watched the pink glow of sunset fade over the snow-capped Himalayas at Mezze by Roadhouse, stay there for a little while before walking over to Thamel and taking a seat in any number of traveller-oriented bars. As long as it’s before 11.30pm, when everything has to shut!"https://hippie-inheels.com/trekking-in-nepal/,nepal,"Why Trekking in Nepal Should Be on Every Traveler’s List As I was driven through the streets of Kathmandu to my hotel on the outskirts of Thamel, I was fondly reminded about why I had fallen in love with Nepal 10 years earlier. The narrow streets of Thamel, lined with food stalls and trekking shops didn’t look very different now, to how I remembered them. The sometimes smothering, sometimes pleasant aura of Tibetan incense was all over the streets and this, coupled with the heavy aromas of the many spices used in Nepali cuisine, nostalgically took me back to my first trip to the country. This time though, I was here to participate in an adventure trip ! Rafting and trekking in Nepal were on the cards and excitement was slowly building up. The chaotic streets of Thamel, Kathmandu Here is why trekking in Nepal should be on every traveler’s list. For those of you who are not familiar with Nepal, the country is a small, very unique nation wedged in between India and China nestled high in the Himalayas. It is home to 8 to the world’s 10 tallest mountains including Mount Everest, the highest, for which it is most famous. Nepal is much more than Everest though. The country is also blessed with gorgeous landscapes, national parks with tigers, elephants and rhinos, rice terraces, beautiful temples and monasteries, diverse ethnic groups and some of the friendliest people that I have ever encountered. Boudhanath Stupa, Kathmandu Rafting in Nepal The day after I arrived, we drove from Kathmandu to Pokhara, stopping for a rafting experience on the Trishuli river on the way. Exhilarating is an understatement! The country’s waters rush straight down from the Himalayas creating gorges through the mountains, hence giving rise to great white water rafting opportunities at different levels. As we got soaked, prodded each other with our paddles and laughed our way along the river, I realized that this was a great way of getting to know the group of people that I would be spending the next 6 days with! Rafting on the Trishuli river is such a fun experience! Trekking the Poon Hill Trek The next day, after having spent the night in Pokhara, we were driven to Nayapul from where we would start our trek. We were on the Poon Hill Trek, a four-day hike across the lower Annapurna region which involves trekking for most of the day, stopping for lunch breaks and finally arriving to a tea house or basic guesthouse where we would spend the night. We were advised to carry only light daypacks, filled with water bottles, a raincoat (essential if you’re trekking in Nepal during the rainy season like we were!) and a few snacks on the trek; porters would be responsible for carrying the rest of our stuff packed in waterproof duffle bags all the way to the teahouses where we would be spending our nights. Since I have always carried all my own stuff on multi-day treks, this seemed like a great arrangement to me! Horses during the trek My first day of trekking in Nepal was as pleasant as it gets. The route to a little village called Tirhedhunga was up across a moderate incline which was easy to hike. Our walk took us over suspended bridges, on little trails by the river, through bamboo forests and besides waterfalls, where we encountered cows, donkeys, goats and some beautiful horses which made the hike all the more interesting. We stopped for lunch at the Mountain View Guesthouse during which it unfortunately it started raining and although we would have liked to wait for it to stop, our guide insisted that we “zam zam” (let’s go). And right he was since it didn’t stop raining all evening. We were trekking during the rainy season where afternoon rains are expected and common. One of the many beautiful views during the four-day trek It was only an hour’s walk to Laxmi Guesthouse where we spent the night in basic, yet comfortable rooms. We had been told that day two was the hardest day of the trek since we would need to climb up 3767 steps possibly in scorching weather conditions so we filled up on noodles, swiss-style rosti and of course everybody’s favourite snack, momos to prepare our bodies and souls for the next day’s climb. It was here we noticed that the dinner menu was identical to the lunch menu at the previous teahouse, and every other menu thereafter would be also be identical. This “generic” menu was pretty vast though, and every teahouse had their own individual style of cooking, so we never actually got the same dish twice! Up 3767 of these steps on Day Two! As expected, day two of the Poon Hill trek was indeed the hardest. Although we had been warned about the stone staircase of 3767 steps, this was not the final number of steps for the day but rather the steps included in one single stretch of the route. The final number surely must have exceeded 5000 steps, which took us up to a height of 2900 metres and although I was exhausted by the end of it, I was happy to have survived a sorely-needed workout! Luckily, the cloudy weather protected us from the scorching sun and although we did not get the best views, since it was so overcast, we did avoid a much-feared sunburn during our climb. We spent the night at Hotel Hill Top in Ghorepani where I devoured a well-deserved yak steak (with more momos on the side of course!) Momos – everybody’s favourite! Day three was the most beautiful of all the days we spent trekking in Nepal. I had set my alarm for 3.30am to be ready in time for an hour’s long uphill trek to Poon Hill to watch the sunrise. Unfortunately a storm pretty much destroyed our sunrise plans although we didn’t complain about the few extra hours of sleep we got, as we groggily went back to our beds! Our climb that day took us up way above the clouds across paths lined with prayer flags and later into foggy forests which added a very eerie and mystical feel to the experience. Fishtail Lodge, our guesthouse that night is well known among trekkers for its coffee and indeed, it was the best I had in Nepal! Up high above the clouds on one of the highest points on the trek The highlight on day 4 should have been waking up to snowy mountain views including a view of the Machhapuchhre mountain with its infamous fishtail peak, but the day was cloudy already and the mountains invisible. Luckily, just before we set off on the last trek, it cleared for just about five seconds so that we could catch a short but sweet glimpse of the snowy mountain peaks which Nepal is so famous for! We woke up to this view on Day Four – snowy mountain peaks at long last! This pretty much set us all in a good mood for the rest of the day. The trek on the fourth day was mostly downhill, and because I find that going down so much easier than going up, I skipped and jumped my way across lush fields and rich forests until we reached the small village of Kimche with gorgeous views of rice terraces. Just outside the village of Kimche This was our final stop and as I sat in the van on my way back to Pokhara, half asleep after the strenuous activity I had endured during the past few days, I promised myself that I would come back to Nepal for the third time, for a longer trek, perhaps right up to Everest Base Camp, so as to enjoy more of what the beautiful country has to offer. Meanwhile, I was looking forward to spending the next couple of days relaxing in the Hotel Pokhara Grande where I could get cleaned up properly and get some laundry sorted, and to enjoy more of Pokhara and Kathmandu over the following days. A hot bath followed by a steaming mug of coffee in the comfort of a luxurious room never felt so good! The path towards Kimche The Food on the Trek I must say that although we were advised the food served during the trek would be “basic”, it actually exceeded everybody’s expectations of it. The choice was vast, the portions were large, most of the dishes I tried were very tasty and I quickly got into the habit of ordering thick milky porridge and Tibetan bread for breakfast, hearty dal bhat accompanied by masala chai for lunch and momos and rosti or pasta for supper. As soon as I arrived at the day’s final guesthouse, I would also follow a routine whereby I would obtain the key to my room, lay out my sleeping bag and other stuff I needed that evening, have a hot shower and join my team mates to celebrate the day’s achievement with an ice cold Gorkha beer. Dal Bhat – trekker’s lunch! Trekking in Nepal up and down hills and mountains, across paths lined with thousands of prayer flags, through lush vegetation and fairytale forests gave me a sense of wonder, peace and fulfillment as well as the opportunity to explore the beautiful country. I encourage every traveler to include trekking in Nepal on their bucket list!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-amsterdam/,netherlands,"What makes Amsterdam a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Amsterdam in general is not the most glamorous city, it’s usually described as raw and edgy. In the last couple of years though the luxury hotels, spa’s and clubs have been on the rise. The hipsters of the city are definitely looking for it so this demand needs a supply. The glamour in the city is usually very Scandinavian based: minimalistic, sharp lines and lots of black and white. This goes for interiors, fashion and the food. What 5 star hotel is the best in Amsterdam? These are actually quite booming at the moment so I’ll mention a couple: The most popular 5* hotel is The Conservatorium hotel . An amazing historic building with huge ceilings and yet it manages to have a very comfy and cozy vibe. Fantastic place for a coffee (or hot chocolate in fall/winter) as well. The Waldorf Astoria doesn’t need explaining I guess but here you’ll find a more international and, if I may say so, conservative crowd. The Amstel Hotel is a classic and has a gorgeous location at the river. The high tea here is amazing too. The Hoxton Hotel is a really nice relaxed 5* hotel with a serious hipster vibe (a lot of Dutch famous actors hang out here). The W Hotel just opened, so for the next couple of months it’s probably going to be very popular. What about boutique hotels in Amsterdam, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? I really love the vibe of the Dylan hotel and The College Hotel is cool as well. The Concious Hotel looks awesome and is eco-friendly too. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Amsterdam? It’s really simple but try the water-bikes in the canals instead of the regular tour boats. They’re a lot harder to navigate than you would think but it’s double the fun (also free workout!). In winter there’s a cool ice skating ring at Leidseplein . In summer go to the deli Bilder &amp; de Clerq or Marqt , head over to the Amsterdamse bos or the Amstelpark (way cooler, more beautiful and peaceful than Vondelpark!) and have a picknic. If you like the crowds you can also picknic at the edge of the canals. Even the most fancy locals love to grab a bottle of wine, some snacks (cheese!) and just watch the people pass by. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Amsterdam? It depends on the weather. In summer everybody is outside on a terrace, having a picknic or at the beach. You can try the city beach Strand Zuid , the terrace of the Hilton Skylounge or one of the super cute places in the historic area de Jordaan. One of my favorite beaches, Wijk aan Zee, is actually a little drive from Amsterdam (20 minutes) but totally worth it. In winter Cafe Brecht is really cool with a very vintage living room feel and they have a lot of exclusive tea varieties. You can also hang out at one of the many new coffee houses, coffee&amp;coconuts just recently opened and Scandinavian Embassy also makes a good cup of coffee. My all time favorite is T , which also has a vintage living room feel and delicious scones. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Amsterdam and what are their best dishes? Lute ( De Oude Molen 5, 1184 VW Amstelveen, Netherlands) is an all time favorite of mine. Not the most common place (also a bit out of the centre) but their food is always gorgeous, extremely beautifully plated and of course tastes delicious as well. Het Bosch is also a really nice place, especially in summer when you can also sit outside. For extremely good pizza (I am talking about the smoked truffle ricotta kind) go to Gustavino (closed in the weekends). For the best sushi go to the Okura Hotel’s Ciel Bleu (and afterwards have a cocktail with a view in their bar). In the centre I would recommend Rijks , the recently opened restaurant attached to the restored Rijksmuseum. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best dessert in Amsterdam? Any of the above mentioned restaurants have fantastic desserts. I must say I am a huge sucker for the custom made Magnum ice creams . If the store is open (best to Google this one before you go, usually it’s only open in summer time and has different locations) make sure to make one. The dark chocolate, chili, violets and roses version is my favorite. Also don’t skip the Nutella store in the Leidsestraat . Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  The easiest place to shop designers (also local) is the Bijenkorf . A huge department store right at Dam Square. For a more local feel you can shop at the P.C. Hooftstraat . Make sure to not miss Shoobaloo . They have amazing designer shoes! Not a fashion brand but any luxury car lover will drool in the awesome Tesla store located in the P.C. Hooftstraat. Also for more local and edgy designers check out the stores at the 9 straatjes area . What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Amsterdam? The Conservatorium Hotel Akasha Spa is one of the best in the city. There are not many places to match it. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Either the Okura Hotel bar or the Hilton SkyLounge. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Jimmy Woo is a classic and still one of my favorites. Make sure to wear heels, do your hair and get your make up on. The door policy is quite strict! Club Air and Club Abe are also cool. Paradiso is one of the oldest and most gorgeous venues in town. It used to be a church and attending a concert here is magic. Definitely check their agenda if there’s a concert you want to see. Finally if you are up for a challenge Club Nyx is also one of my favorites. Be aware though: it’s a gay club and it also looks very grimey/raw/edgy. This is the real Amsterdam clubbing if you are up for it."https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,netherlands,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,netherlands,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Paris: Au Royal Mad Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Prague: Hotel Opletalova Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Zurich: Ramada Hotel Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Rome: Hotel Leone Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff.

If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-auckland/,new_zealand,"What makes  Auckland  a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Auckland is a heavenly destination hidden far from the rest of the world, with beautiful mountains, beaches and amazing hiking trails which gives a relaxed feel to the city. New Zealand has 8 major wine regions and Auckland is one of them, with the stunning sunny days and clear cooler nights it really helps our wines too bring out their exquisite taste. Auckland has a variety of vineyards particularly toward the west of Auckland with all the beautiful mountains and beaches in Kumeu or Whaiheke Island which is a 30 minute ferry crossing from away from city center. Auckland has a good selection of shopping malls and nightlife with live jazz music, pently of bars and clubs in the city center. Auckland is the best luxury place to visit and it was rated on the Mercer Quality of Living Survey as the third most liveable city in the world, this destination should be on everyones list to see! Auckland is built on 48 volcanos and has around 1.5 million people with a large melting pot of cultures. There’s always lots to do in Auckland, especially during the kiwi summer from December – February. Here’s a good infographic on some non-touristy things to do in Auckland. Aucklanders are a pretty relaxed bunch and love rugby, cold beer, fish and chips and mince and cheese pies. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? It has to be Langham , an exquisite hotel right in the heart of Auckland city, at the Langham the moment you walk into the hotel you feel like you have walked into a fantasy world! They really know how to make you feel special from the point you walk in, until you leave.   The hotel has an old world charm to it, with antique furniture giving it that sophisticated yet traditional look. Always check their website for special offers as they often have some good deals – take a look at the ‘five star fling’ package starting at US$200 with a buffet breakfast, valet parking and a bottle of bubbles on arrival! Langham runs a very popular high tea which is well worth the visit also a buffet restaurant called ‘8’ which offers selections from eight different cuisines Indian, Chinese, seafood, sushi, American style grill cooked, salad bar, freshly made breads and a nice section of desserts My advice is to have a light breakfast and head to 8’s buffet during the week for lunch at a cost of US$38, dinner is bit pricey at US$73 from Monday to Thursday or Friday to Sunday US$81 While you are staying at the Langham, keep fit by using the fully equipped gym, or enjoy an evening swim in the the heated pool. Langham:  Address – 83 Symonds St Grafton, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.  Phone: +64 9-379 5132 Honourable mention: While the Amora Hotel is a 4 star hotel, it’s my personal choice after a big night out in the city. It offers affordable rates with all the facilities you need and it’s a short walk into the central city to the theatres and nightlife When we book a room at the Amora we always check on their website – look under specials and packages as they often have better deals than the third party booking sites. They do have under ground parking at a cost of US$16 per day. Most rooms have a beautiful view from the balcony over looking Myers park and city centre, be sure to ask the staff for a room with the view. Rooms are nice and spacious with a kitchenette, washer/dyer and the beds are very comfortable. I always book the deluxe king spa room which comes with an in-room spa bath and yes a giant king sized bed. The buffet breakfast is great, be sure to get downstairs before 10am Check out time is at 10am but when booking the room ask for a late check out, especially if you have been partying all night   Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? New Zealand is well known for it’s adventure activities, if you aren’t scared of heights, try the Auckland harbour bridge walk and enjoy the stunning views of the Waitemata Harbour (US$92). Or if you’re game, jump off the harbour bridge on an AJ Hackett bungy experience (US$124). Best thing is you get half of the bridge walk included! If you’re looking for something more scenic but still a good adrenaline rush – try a tandem skydive Jump out of a perfectly good airplane from 9,000 feet, with 25 seconds of free fall. Skydive Auckland has a beautiful drop zone which lets you see Auckland city from a unique birds eye view (US$229)   Where are the best hang outs during the day? Auckland has many options when it comes to beaches here are my 2 favorites Waiheke Island is amazing for a day trip, its only 35 minutes away from Auckland, hop on a ferry from downtown (USD$35 return). Go on a wine tasting tour there are plenty of vineyards on this island, after doing some wine tasting head down to the beach to relax and work on the tan, there are heaps of other activates to be enjoyed, go for a bush walk, shop for unique arts and crafts in Oneroa, kayak around the coast of the island or find a nice cafe for a long lunch. Murawai beach is one of Auckands unique black sand west coast beach’s, there is so much to see and do, mountain biking, learning to surf, taking your dog for swim, fishing and much more check out this link for more details on Murawai If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Auckland and what are their best dishes (include any location information you have)? Skycity’s Orbit revolving restaurant located on the top of the sky tower is a romantic place for a meal and to enjoy the beautiful view – 360degree in the 190 meter high skytower, which goes through a full rotation every hour. You get to enjoy the magnificent view of the habour and the city center. The price is affordable for US$55 you get an entree, main and your choice of dessert. When going to Orbit you don’t have to worry about parking as Skycity has plenty of underground parking. If you spend a minimum of USD$31 at the restaurant you will only pay USD$4 for the car parking best of all this dinning experience allows you to head up to the sky tower view point for free! What to order? Whenever I go to Orbit I always order the same! Entree – Roasted scallops Main – Akaro habour salmon smokey glayzed Dessert -Warm Pecan pie with beautiful night cappuccino black raspberry liqueur Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? I am absolutely in love with the Langham ‘8’ restaurant as there is no place in Auckland that really has a dessert buffet, great value for money if you have a sweet tooth like me :) The runner up has to be the Chocolate Bouquet cafe in Parnell, it’s not a big cafe, big but has a awesome collection of sweets, coffee and of course desserts.     If you want something healthy in Auckland , you can find that too! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? Queen street is the hub of shopping you can find all the big brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton. There are plenty of shops on High street with trendy fashion designers, accessories, art and gadgets. Famous local designers like Trelise Cooper can be found on the walking street in Britomart down town. Karen Walker’s collection can also be found on the walking street or at Smith and Caughey’s. Kate Sylvester’s collection is at Smith and Caugheys department store on Queen street. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Auckland?   Rodney Wayne is one of the more popular hair salons chains around town, their staff are highly qualified and they will make sure you always come out feeling like a million dollars. Our whole family has been using Rodney wayne salons for more than 13 years! Mollies day spa is a elegant place to unwind with your loved ones as they cater for both men and women. Mollies offers a variety of treaments from therapeutic facials to smoothing massage therapy and pedicures. Relax and enjoy your time getting pampered. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go?   Devonport is one of those destinations you won’t easily forget, it’s not a very big town, but it’s very unique with gorgeous boutique craft stores, homely cafes and quaint bars. Devonport also has a couple of nice beaches where you can enjoy a spectacular view of the sunset. Take a picnic and wind down with glass of wine in one hand, great company on the other hand. It’s only 10 minutes ride from down town ferry terminal at a cost of just US$9. During the Summer the best time to watch the sunset is around 8:30pm. Before you go head out check the current sunset times. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us in on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great per-gaming spot. Skycity casino never sleeps, providing you with live bands, nice bars and dj’s playing your favorite tunes seven days a week, it is one of those places where you really have to dress to impress! Skycity has your entertainment sorted, lot’s of gameing machines and if you want to get bit more serious there are the table games as well, my favorite game to play is roulette. For dining they have a huge selection of food, 16 restaurants offering cuisine from all over the world Chinese, Japanese or the deli if you want to grab a quick bite on the run. I really enjoy The grill by Sean Connolly as they do the best scotch fillet in town My standard order at the Grill Entree – Prawn with garlic butter Main – Scotch fillet with a baby beetroot salad Dessert– Carrot cake You can get started at the Skycity bar’s, play some games and if you feel like a boogie, there are few clubs in the casino to get you going!   If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards?   Once you are done with your dining and played a few hands at the gaming tables, lets go dancing! You don’t have to go very far – the XO bar is on the same level as the casino, XO is one of the most exclusive and up market bars in Auckland city. This place is beautiful and very sophisticated providing a wide range of drinks and a great range of hot finger food from 6pm – 2am. A Great place for groups or for people who enjoy high quality nightlife."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/11/new-zealand-budget-auckland-rotorua-itinerary-expenses/,new_zealand,"NEW ZEALAND ON A BUDGET: Auckland and Rotorua Travel Guide 2017 New Zealand is one of those destinations that need no introduction. There’s a big chance that you — my friend, reading this post right now — have either dreamed of visiting at least once in your life or have already decided to visit in the near, far, or far, far future. New Zealand is spellbinding in that way. Just a mere mention of its name captivates, conjuring up images of a fantasy world: magical, enchanting, and absolutely epic.       New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland is the most accessible gateway to the country. It is home to 1.45 million people, a third of New Zealand’s population. During my stay, I tried to document as much details as possible so I could create this quick travel guide on how you can enjoy a piece of it too.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? When to Visit How to Get to Auckland How to Get from Auckland Airport to City Center Where to stay in Auckland How to Get Around Auckland Places to Visit in Auckland How to Get from Auckland to Hobbiton and Rotorua Places to Visit from Rotorua Where to Stay in Rotorua Sample 5D-4N Itinerary and Expenses More Tips for the Poor Traveler Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts When to Visit New Zealand is in the southern hemisphere so their summer kicks in around December and winter in June. In general, when it comes to weather, Auckland is pleasant year-round, but summer (December-February) is the most popular. The downside, it is also the peak season, which means higher airfare and hotel rates. Winter gets some rain showers every now and then but rarely goes to the extreme. The months of May (end of fall) and November (spring) are the most highly recommended because the weather is still great but you can avoid thick tourist crowds.   Auckland   How to Get to Auckland There are no direct flights from Manila to Auckland, so you will have to make a connection somewhere else. But that’s when it gets tricky. A good connection to Auckland from Manila is hard to find if you’re traveling on a tight budget. But here are a few reminders: As much as possible, book the legs of your journey with the same airline. Why? So you don’t need to worry about your luggage. You just check it in and pick it up in Auckland. This also gets you covered in case the first flight gets delayed and you miss the next flight. The airline will accommodate you in their next flight for FREE. If you book the second flight with a different airline, they’re not under any obligation to provide new tickets. If you’re booking the connecting flight separately, ask if that airline has some sort of partnership with the other airline. Some carriers have agreements that might include seamless baggage transfer. Also check the layover time. Know that if you book flights separately, in many cases you will have to collect your baggage and check in again before you can board the next flight. ALSO, if it’s connecting in a city that requires a visa, you might need to pass through Immigration first before the baggage pick-up so check the visa policy of that country. If you’re on a holiday, take TIME as currency too. It’s not always about the price. Consider the travel time. Some fares are so low but they entail a super-lengthy layover. You don’t want to spend more than 20 hours en route when you could have used that time to explore New Zealand. This makes the Philippine Airlines offer attractive. It is pricey, like most flights to New Zealand, but it’s stress-free. The travel time is also just a bit more than 10 hours while other airlines would take as much as 34 hours (including connecting flight). Also consider the travel time. Philippine Airlines flies to Auckland from Manila every: WEDNESDAY, TUESDAY, SUNDAYPR 218 – ETD 02:05pmETA 4:30pm +1 day after Important! New Zealand is very strict with biosecurity. Be sure to declare or dispose of the following items before entering New Zealand. False declaration can incur a nz$400 fine: Any food – includes cooked, uncooked, fresh, preserved, packed, or dried.

Day tours from Auckland are available, but they are ridiculously expensive.

To go to Hobbiton , you can book an Intercity bus to Matamata. Fare: NZD 22 (USD 16, PHP 780) .

PAL flies to Auckland only 3 days weekly so timing is important. Set ample time from the airport to your hotel since it might take you a while to get out of Auckland’s airport due to their very strict bio security checks. Most hostels have an open kitchen that you can use. Instead of eating out, head over to the supermarket and buy ingredients. It’s a lot cheaper this way. When walking around Downtown Auckland, I found it helpful to use the Sky Tower as reference to my location. If you’re booking with InterCity, plan your trip well and book all your tickets at once. They charge a one-time NZD 3.99 booking fee. This is a work-in-progress. We will be updating this travel guide as we receive more info and experience more of New Zealand."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-auckland/,new_zealand,"What makes  Auckland  a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Auckland is a heavenly destination hidden far from the rest of the world, with beautiful mountains, beaches and amazing hiking trails which gives a relaxed feel to the city. New Zealand has 8 major wine regions and Auckland is one of them, with the stunning sunny days and clear cooler nights it really helps our wines too bring out their exquisite taste. Auckland has a variety of vineyards particularly toward the west of Auckland with all the beautiful mountains and beaches in Kumeu or Whaiheke Island which is a 30 minute ferry crossing from away from city center. Auckland has a good selection of shopping malls and nightlife with live jazz music, pently of bars and clubs in the city center. Auckland is the best luxury place to visit and it was rated on the Mercer Quality of Living Survey as the third most liveable city in the world, this destination should be on everyones list to see! Auckland is built on 48 volcanos and has around 1.5 million people with a large melting pot of cultures. There’s always lots to do in Auckland, especially during the kiwi summer from December – February. Here’s a good infographic on some non-touristy things to do in Auckland. Aucklanders are a pretty relaxed bunch and love rugby, cold beer, fish and chips and mince and cheese pies. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? It has to be Langham , an exquisite hotel right in the heart of Auckland city, at the Langham the moment you walk into the hotel you feel like you have walked into a fantasy world! They really know how to make you feel special from the point you walk in, until you leave.   The hotel has an old world charm to it, with antique furniture giving it that sophisticated yet traditional look. Always check their website for special offers as they often have some good deals – take a look at the ‘five star fling’ package starting at US$200 with a buffet breakfast, valet parking and a bottle of bubbles on arrival! Langham runs a very popular high tea which is well worth the visit also a buffet restaurant called ‘8’ which offers selections from eight different cuisines Indian, Chinese, seafood, sushi, American style grill cooked, salad bar, freshly made breads and a nice section of desserts My advice is to have a light breakfast and head to 8’s buffet during the week for lunch at a cost of US$38, dinner is bit pricey at US$73 from Monday to Thursday or Friday to Sunday US$81 While you are staying at the Langham, keep fit by using the fully equipped gym, or enjoy an evening swim in the the heated pool. Langham:  Address – 83 Symonds St Grafton, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.  Phone: +64 9-379 5132 Honourable mention: While the Amora Hotel is a 4 star hotel, it’s my personal choice after a big night out in the city. It offers affordable rates with all the facilities you need and it’s a short walk into the central city to the theatres and nightlife When we book a room at the Amora we always check on their website – look under specials and packages as they often have better deals than the third party booking sites. They do have under ground parking at a cost of US$16 per day. Most rooms have a beautiful view from the balcony over looking Myers park and city centre, be sure to ask the staff for a room with the view. Rooms are nice and spacious with a kitchenette, washer/dyer and the beds are very comfortable. I always book the deluxe king spa room which comes with an in-room spa bath and yes a giant king sized bed. The buffet breakfast is great, be sure to get downstairs before 10am Check out time is at 10am but when booking the room ask for a late check out, especially if you have been partying all night   Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? New Zealand is well known for it’s adventure activities, if you aren’t scared of heights, try the Auckland harbour bridge walk and enjoy the stunning views of the Waitemata Harbour (US$92). Or if you’re game, jump off the harbour bridge on an AJ Hackett bungy experience (US$124). Best thing is you get half of the bridge walk included! If you’re looking for something more scenic but still a good adrenaline rush – try a tandem skydive Jump out of a perfectly good airplane from 9,000 feet, with 25 seconds of free fall. Skydive Auckland has a beautiful drop zone which lets you see Auckland city from a unique birds eye view (US$229)   Where are the best hang outs during the day? Auckland has many options when it comes to beaches here are my 2 favorites Waiheke Island is amazing for a day trip, its only 35 minutes away from Auckland, hop on a ferry from downtown (USD$35 return). Go on a wine tasting tour there are plenty of vineyards on this island, after doing some wine tasting head down to the beach to relax and work on the tan, there are heaps of other activates to be enjoyed, go for a bush walk, shop for unique arts and crafts in Oneroa, kayak around the coast of the island or find a nice cafe for a long lunch.

What to order? Whenever I go to Orbit I always order the same! Entree – Roasted scallops Main – Akaro habour salmon smokey glayzed Dessert -Warm Pecan pie with beautiful night cappuccino black raspberry liqueur Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? I am absolutely in love with the Langham ‘8’ restaurant as there is no place in Auckland that really has a dessert buffet, great value for money if you have a sweet tooth like me :) The runner up has to be the Chocolate Bouquet cafe in Parnell, it’s not a big cafe, big but has a awesome collection of sweets, coffee and of course desserts.     If you want something healthy in Auckland , you can find that too! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? Queen street is the hub of shopping you can find all the big brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton. There are plenty of shops on High street with trendy fashion designers, accessories, art and gadgets. Famous local designers like Trelise Cooper can be found on the walking street in Britomart down town. Karen Walker’s collection can also be found on the walking street or at Smith and Caughey’s. Kate Sylvester’s collection is at Smith and Caugheys department store on Queen street. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Auckland?   Rodney Wayne is one of the more popular hair salons chains around town, their staff are highly qualified and they will make sure you always come out feeling like a million dollars. Our whole family has been using Rodney wayne salons for more than 13 years! Mollies day spa is a elegant place to unwind with your loved ones as they cater for both men and women. Mollies offers a variety of treaments from therapeutic facials to smoothing massage therapy and pedicures. Relax and enjoy your time getting pampered. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go?   Devonport is one of those destinations you won’t easily forget, it’s not a very big town, but it’s very unique with gorgeous boutique craft stores, homely cafes and quaint bars. Devonport also has a couple of nice beaches where you can enjoy a spectacular view of the sunset. Take a picnic and wind down with glass of wine in one hand, great company on the other hand. It’s only 10 minutes ride from down town ferry terminal at a cost of just US$9. During the Summer the best time to watch the sunset is around 8:30pm. Before you go head out check the current sunset times. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us in on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great per-gaming spot. Skycity casino never sleeps, providing you with live bands, nice bars and dj’s playing your favorite tunes seven days a week, it is one of those places where you really have to dress to impress! Skycity has your entertainment sorted, lot’s of gameing machines and if you want to get bit more serious there are the table games as well, my favorite game to play is roulette. For dining they have a huge selection of food, 16 restaurants offering cuisine from all over the world Chinese, Japanese or the deli if you want to grab a quick bite on the run. I really enjoy The grill by Sean Connolly as they do the best scotch fillet in town My standard order at the Grill Entree – Prawn with garlic butter Main – Scotch fillet with a baby beetroot salad Dessert– Carrot cake You can get started at the Skycity bar’s, play some games and if you feel like a boogie, there are few clubs in the casino to get you going!   If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards?   Once you are done with your dining and played a few hands at the gaming tables, lets go dancing! You don’t have to go very far – the XO bar is on the same level as the casino, XO is one of the most exclusive and up market bars in Auckland city. This place is beautiful and very sophisticated providing a wide range of drinks and a great range of hot finger food from 6pm – 2am. A Great place for groups or for people who enjoy high quality nightlife."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-queenstown/,new_zealand,"What makes Queenstown a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Queenstown has so much to offer luxury-oriented travelers. It’s a pretty expensive city to visit and as New Zealand’s tourism hub many companies catering to the luxury traveler have sprung up. There are 5-star hotels, amazing fine dining restaurants, spas, and many activities to keep you busy. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? We’ve stayed at the Hilton which is about 10 minutes’ drive out of Queenstown, but it is in a lovely setting right next to the lake. They even have jet boats to take you from the hotel to town and back again if you don’t want to drive! What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Blanket Bay , about 45 minutes’ drive from Queenstown in the small town of Glenorchy, is one of New Zealand’s top luxury hotels. It’s got a hefty price tag but from what we hear it’s an incredible place to stay. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? There are so many fun activities to do in Queenstown that it would take forever to list them all! One of the best activities we have done (and highly recommend) is a scenic flight to Milford Sound. The mountainous landscape surrounding Queenstown make it an ideal place to do a scenic flight – the views are just breathtaking. Landing at Milford Sound and doing a boat cruise is like being transported to another world. There are also jet boat tours, and the vineyard scene around Queenstown is great too – there are guided tours so that you can drink and don’t have to drive! Check out this article on 36 hours in Queenstown for more ideas of activities and places to go! Where are the best hang outs during the day? Sitting on the lakefront in a café or bar is one of our favourite things to do in Queenstown. With the mountains all around and a great coffee in hand it’s not hard to feel happy! Queenstown Gardens are right next to the town and are worth a walk around too. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Queenstown and what are their best dishes? We recently visited Madam Woo, on Mall St in Queenstown. This restaurant serves amazing Malaysian fusion food – our favourite dishes were the beef rendang curry and the pork hawker roll – kind of like a Malaysian-style taco! For a more fancy dinner, head to Botswana Butchery on the lakefront. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Patagonia Chocolates on Beach Street has a huge selection of ice cream and gelato, as well as dessert dishes. Their hot chocolate is to die for! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Queenstown? Onsen Hot Pools, about 10 minutes out of Queenstown, have private spa pools overlooking the beautiful Shotover River. You can hire the pools by the hour and you can add on extras like champagne and candles – it’s such a fun and relaxing experience! There are massage and spa services in all the good hotels in Queenstown. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Anywhere along the lake front has beautiful sunset views. You can also catch the Skyline Gondola up to the top of the hill above Queenstown for some excellent views over the town, lake, and surrounding mountains. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. There is a multitude of bars in Queenstown – there are so many travelers around that every night is party night! We love Bardeaux, it’s tucked away down a lane and it serves a wide range of whiskies and other spirits as well as renowned local wine."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-oslo/,norway,"What makes Oslo a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Oslo has changed a lot over the last couple of years. The city is now home to Michelin starred restaurants, Asian fusion dining spots, independent boutiques for Scandinavian design, interesting museums, and hip, urban coffee bars. The city center is small, so you can easily see most of it in a weekend. Also, the city is surrounded by nature, so you can combine your dose of city fuel with fresh air from the forest and the sea. What 5 star hotel is the best in Oslo? The Thief is definitely my number one luxury hotel in Oslo. It’s modern and stylish, and has a great location – close to the Oslo Fjord. Their rooftop terrace is a good place for summer evening cocktails. What about the best boutique hotels in Oslo, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Saga Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel in Frogner, a beautiful neighborhood west of the city center. The hotel is small and charming, and has a great location. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Oslo? Oslo is a true haven for adventure seekers. In winter you can go cross-country skiing, downhill skiing or snowboarding, and in summer there’s plenty of beach fun going on. Swim in the Oslo Fjord or hop on a ferry to one of the islands! Where are the best hang outs during the day- café, beach, or park? Frognerparken is a popular place for a BBQ in summer and you’ll also find tons of beautiful statues here. Grünerløkka, a neighborhood in the eastern part of town where hipsters feel at home, is where you’ll find coffee shops from world champion baristas, restaurants serving world cuisine and local craft beer breweries. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Oslo and what are their best dishes? Oslo is home to fabulous fish restaurants and you can get some of the best sushi in Europe here, but I always recommend Hitchhiker , a funky restaurant serving up inventive cuisine. Their menu changes often and features dishes like dumpling burgers and a re-fried bean and bacon taco. The restaurant is located on the second floor of Oslo’s food market, Mathallen.      Let’s talk desserts in Oslo- what place makes the best? Pascal is the place to go to for sweet treats, such as homemade chocolates, macarons and beautiful pastries. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Oslo; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Nest is a cute little store where they sell Scandinavian interior items and… cupcakes. Great combo, right? Kollekted By is another gem for interior items and gifts. Babel is a must-visit if you’re looking for fashion from local and international designers. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Oslo? I recommend Colosseum Spa for beauty treatments, massages and other divine spa experiences. It’s a calm city spa with friendly staff and a beautiful interior. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? If you’re traveling together with your partner, I’d recommend taking the ferry to one of the islands. Bring a blanket, a good bottle of wine and some snacks, and enjoy the long Norwegian summer evenings and the beautiful sunset. Another great option is Holmenkollen, the green area outside the city center where you’ll have beautiful views over the fjord. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Cocktail lovers will enjoy Bar Boca, a small bar with a long history and some of the best mixologists in the city. Fuglen, a vintage coffee bar that turns into a cocktail heaven at night is a great choice, too, and so is Torggata Botaniske, one of the newbies in town."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-tromso/,norway,"Luxury Guide to Tromsø Welcome to Backpacker’s Boutique. Every Sunday, this spot will feature the luxury side of an awesome city. Guest bloggers will share about either their hometown or a town they are expat in and know very deeply so that you get a guide straight from a local.   E-mail me if you’d like to be featured. A Luxury Guide to Tromsø Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you’re an expert on luxury travel in Tromso. My name is Vanessa and I blog about my life and travels in Scandinavia and the Arctic at Snow in Tromso . I’ve been living in Tromso for two years now after having moved there from Germany. I was a grad student for most of this time so money was tight. However I kept a list of restaurants I wanted to eat at and activities I wanted to do, that I’ve finally begun to cross off now that I’ve graduated and got a full-time job. Tromso, as the rest of Norway, is an expensive place but it offers a lot and is the perfect destination if you’re looking to experience the Arctic in style! What makes Tromso a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Tromso has the nickname “Paris of the North” which it got by a German travelling to the city in the 18 th century, expecting a poor and backward place in the middle of nowhere. Instead he found fashion and architecture in line with what was trendy in central Europe at that time, hence his exclamation “This must be the Paris of the North”. Still today, Tromso is a hip and trendy place, trying to make the most out of its location in the Arctic. Thus you can spend your day going shopping or dog-sledding and your nights watching the Northern Lights from a whirlpool on a yacht. If that isn’t glamorous, I don’t know what is! What 5 star hotel is the best in Tromso? Even though it’s only got 4 stars, Clarion Hotel The Edge is the most luxurious hotel you can find in Tromso. It has been opened in 2014 and has quickly become the most popular hotel in town. It’s where the Norwegian Royals stay whenever they visit the city. The Edge also hosts one of the finest restaurants in town: Kitchen &amp; Table by Marcus Samuelsson where you are served Manhattan cuisine with an Arctic twist. What about boutique hotels in Tromso, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Again, The Edge would be my first choice but Scandic Ishavshotel and Clarion Collection Hotel w ith would be my alternatives. Even though they are both chain hotels, they offer a glamorous view on the fjord and the Arctic Cathedral. Scandic Ishavshotel furthermore is the best breakfast and brunch spot in town while Hotel With is situated in one of those historic wooden buildings at the waterfront that are so typical for Norway. It’s also close to the best sea food restaurant in town: Fiskekompaniet. If you’re okay with staying outside of the city though, I’d recommend Malangen Brygger and Sommaroy Arctic Hotel . Both hotels offer luxury cabins with fantastic views on the fjords. Malangen Brygger is at a fjord south of Tromso and an ideal place for watching the Northern Lights or experiencing the Midnight Sun. Sommaroy Arctic Hotel then again is situated north of Tromso on the so called “Summer Island” where you’ll find sandy beaches and turquoise waters. It’s one of my favourite places in the area and definitely the best one if you’re visiting during summertime. Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Tromso? Tons! During winter, you can choose between experiencing the Northern Lights in the wilderness, and going dog-sledding, whale-watching, snow-shoe hiking or ice-fishing. In the summer, you can go on a fjord cruise or RiB ride, try kayaking, go glacier hiking or simply go fishing. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Tromso? On a sunny day, you’ve got to visit the beach Telegrafbukta. As soon as the sun comes out, no matter how cold and windy it is, the locals head to the beach to sun-bathe or take a dip in the ice-cold ocean. Even if you don’t feel the urge to take off your clothes in 12 degree Celsius weather, a visit to the beach is time worth spent anyway. The scenery is just gorgeous as the beach is situated at a fjord from which you can admire the stunning mountains of the neighbouring island Kvaloya. On a rainy day, you should head to Risø – the no. 1 café in town. Locals and tourists agree that Risø serves the best coffee in all of Tromso and the place is packed every day at midday as they serve delicious lunches as well! If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Tromso and what are their best dishes? In case you’re staying at The Edge, you don’t even need to leave the hotel as their restaurant Kitchen &amp; Table will serve you dishes inspired by New York, but with a local Arctic twist. Their menu features for example “Rudolf loves beets” (reindeer meat), “Icelandic dream of Björn” (pulled pork) and “The King Crab &amp; CO”. If you’d like to try traditional Norwegian cuisine though, I can only recommend Fiskekompaniet and Hildr. Fiskekompaniet is a sea food restaurant and they serve the best halibut that I have ever eaten in my entire life! If you’d like to eat meat instead of sea food, Hildr serves some really nice reindeer meat which is traditional for the Sami, the indigenous people in Northern Scandinavia. Another great place for when all you really want is pizza – but in style, is Casa Inferno. Not only do they serve the best pizza in town, they also serve beer from local craft breweries and all of that in a steampunk atmosphere with the waiters being dressed up and the walls being decorated with gas masks – highly recommended! Let’s talk desserts – what place makes the best? Kitchen &amp; Table has a pretty interesting dessert menu and I’ve once ate nitrogen ice-cream and bacon-banana “Elvis” cookies there which were absolutely fabulous. If you’re looking for more “traditional” desserts though, the restaurant Egon offers an Oreo cake and milkshakes that are to die for! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Tromso. Who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Scandinavians are trendsetters in both fashion and interior design so if you’re coming to Tromso to get a hold of the latest trends, you’re definitely visiting the right place. If you’re into fashion, Moods of Norway is the place to go to. Situated on the main street of the city, this boutique sells gorgeous Norwegian woolen sweaters and the latest party dresses. If you’re however looking for inspiration on how to decorate your flat, Kiil is where you should go! Situated downtown, this interior design store has everything from lamps to sofas – Scandinavian style. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Tromso? The best and most unique spa in town would be Vulkana – or better MS Vulkana! This spa is actually situated on a boat and offers you the opportunity to admire the Arctic fjords from a hot tub on deck. And if that’s not exciting enough, the boat also has a sauna and a Turkish hamam! Places are limited and the spa is only open on Saturdays for a spa cruise and on Sundays while staying at the harbor, so you should make a reservation before coming to town. PS: The Norwegian crown prince booked the spa for a cruise with the Dutch royals not too long ago so remember to feel like a royal when bathing in the hot tub! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? If you’re visiting Tromso during summer and you’d like to experience the Midnight Sun, the best place for this would be Fjellheisen . Take the cable car up the mountain and watch how the sun doesn’t set but rather moves around Tromso Island from above! Fjellheisen is also a great place to visit during polar night. The sun doesn’t rise during that time but the sky turns orange and pink around midday when the sun almost makes it over the horizon. It’s a really special experience on a clear day and can best be watched from the top of the mountain! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks. No visit to Tromso is complete without a beer at Ølhallen – the oldest pub in town. Ølhallen is part of the local Mack Brewery so you can choose from 50 different beers here. And don’t forget to take a selfie with the polar bear – the pub’s interior is classically Norwegian and reminds you of the old polar explorations! If you end the night at a fancy club in Tromso, which one do you head towards? Gründer is the place to be on a Saturday night. It’s motto is “Hard Work – Hard Fun” and it’s packed all the time so be early! There’s live music Wednesdays to Saturdays and you can grab some tapas if you’re a bit peckish."https://hippie-inheels.com/casco-viejo-old-quarter-guide-panama-citys-cutest-neighborhood/,panama,"Casco Viejo Old Quarter Guide: Panama City’s Cutest Neighborhood I spent over 3 weeks in Panama City, and my favorite part, by far, was Casco Viejo – or the old historic district. It’s by far the most Instagrammable place in Panama City and I’ve put together this Casco Viejo old quarter guide so you know exactly where to go. This neighborhood is jam packed with the prettiest historic buildings – some perfectly restored, and some crumbling (but kinda in a pretty way). It’s also the artsy neighborhood, packed with shops, galleries, boutiques, restaurants, cafes and nightlife. And it’s a little peninsula surrounded by the Pacific ocean, so there are picturesque views on all sides. I highly recommend spending most of your time in Panama City in Casco Viejo, before heading on to explore other parts of the country – like the Caribbean islands of Bocas del Toro, the cloud forest of Boquete , the surf towns of the  Azuero Peninsula , or the picture perfect San Blas Islands. Casco Viejo is a great place to stay, or just go to wander the streets, eat at one of the restaurants, or do some shopping. Casco Viejo Old Quarter guide: What to Do Walk &amp; Photo the Historic Streets The best activity in Casco Viejo is just to wander the colorful and charming streets! Be sure to pack your camera and stroll slowly so you can take in all the details. The neighborhood is actually quite small, so you can do this fast if you’re short on time, or you can take your time and wander each street and alleyway. People Watch in the Plazas There are several pretty parks with benches and trees for shade. They’re each surrounded by beautiful buildings, and are great for people watching. Grab an ice cream and sit in the Plaza de la Independencia , the Plaza Tomas Herrera , Plaza Simon Bolivar , and the Quinto Centenario . Quinto Centenario has a great view of Casco Viejo as well as of the modern high-rises on the opposite side. It’s a great place see the melding of old and new that defines Panama City. And in the evening, it’s usually filled with people. See the Historic Churches Be sure to check out the beautiful historic churches in this area – including Iglesia de la Merced , Iglesia de San Jose , Iglesia San Francisco , and La Catedral . Also, look for the ruins of the Iglesia Santo Domingo . This church was built in the 16th century but destroyed in a fire in 1756. Check Out the Other Historical Sites The churches aren’t the only noteworthy historic buildings. Be sure to check out the Palacio Municipal (the city hall), the Palacio de las Garzas (the presidential palace which was built in 1673), and the Teatro Nacional (the national theater). Walk the Old Wall &amp; Shop Take a stroll on the Paseo de las Bovedas or Paseo Esteban Huertas – the old stone wall built in colonial times to protect against pirate attacks – on the southeastern side of Casco Viejo. This wall curves around the coast, giving a great view of the modern skyscrapers, ships, and the ocean. You’ll find lots of vendors here selling traditional goods, including the Kuna Yala people who make beautiful and bright textiles. You can do some shopping for souvenirs here. Casco Viejo: What to Eat Mercado de Mariscos or Seafood Market If you’re in Panama City, you HAVE to eat at the Mercado de Mariscos (Not to be confused with the restaurant called Fish Market). It’s an institution here – a large market next to the ocean that gets fresh fish dropped off every day from the many fishing boats that pull into its port. Walking around the market is interesting in its own right – you’ll see expert fishmongers carving up fish for ceviche or filets. And if you go up to the second floor, you’ll get an aerial view of what everyone has, sometimes seeing giant fish below! But while you’re there, you have to sample some of the super fresh seafood. Outside the market, there are tons of food vendors in a line selling everything from ceviche to fish prepared in different ways. Look for one of the vendors that’s busy (that means it’s good! One of my foolproof ways of finding good and safe street food in Latin America ). Sit down and order some of Panama’s famous ceviche – it’s really delicious here! Another great dish to order is the fried fish filet served with plantains and salad. La Rana Dorada This is a local brewery chain that has a location in Casco Viejo. Their in-house beer is great, and they have a nice happy hour deal. There is a seating area outside and a view of the water from the front. It’s a great place to grab a beer after an afternoon of wandering the streets of Casco Viejo. They also have great bar food. Their burger was delicious! Maisa is a great, slightly upscale version of the local ceviche. Prices are still affordable, but they take a twist on the classic Panamanian ceviche, and add different flavors. They’re well known for their delicious and unique salsas. You can choose which one you’d like on your ceviche. Some of their choices are pineapple, buffalo, guayaba, maracuyá (passion fruit), tamarindo, chimichurri, etc.. Yum! They also have outside seating. Casco Viejo: Where to Drink: La Rana Dorada Again, La Rana Dorada is a great place to sample some local beer. The atmosphere is a comfortable and casual brewery. It’s great for happy hour drinks inside or out, or a casual evening drink. Mojitos sin Mojitos Mojitos sin Mojitos is a cute bar on the southeast corner of Plaza Herrera. The decor is rustic and hip. Don’t let the name confuse you, this bar doesn’t actually serve mojitos. It’s a beer bar that also serves some mixed drinks. They also are famous for their bbq burgers. Prices are very reasonable and there is always a good crowd there. Pina Calavera Pina Calavera is an underground nightclub in Casco Viejo. You’ll find live music and events here. It’s a great place to go to dance and have a good time. Tantalo If you’re looking for a true club experience, head to Tantalo where the trendiest Panamanians go to have fun. Their rooftop bar has a great view of the skyline, and the crowd is a nice mix of locals and tourists, dancing to the DJ’s set. Casco Viejo: Where to Stay American Trade Hotel The American Trade Hotel is the most stylish place to stay in town. The building is breathtaking with gorgeous tile, jungley greens, and clean mid-century modern furnishings inside. Las Clementinas Las Clementinas is a beautifully restored vintage building with 6 large suites. The rooms are furnished with clean modern furniture, and beautiful touches are everywhere like the pretty tile in the shower, or the colorful ethnic pillows on the bed. If you head to Panama, you will surely be passing through Panama City on your way in and out of the country. Be sure to check out the best part of the city – Casco Viejo. You’ll find all the charm of a historic neighborhood with hip and modern restaurants, bars and shops."https://hippie-inheels.com/cusco-city-guide-what-to-do-eat-drink-and-where-to-stay/,peru,"Cusco City Guide: What to Do, Eat, Drink and Where to Stay If you go to Peru, you will most definitely be spending some time in Cusco. It’s the gateway to Machu PIcchu and the Inca Trail , and anything else you might want to do in the Southern Andes. Besides being a tourist hub, Cusco is actually really charming and lovely. I spent 2 weeks in this city, and loved wandering the pretty cobblestone streets, looking at the colorful blue ornate doors, and discovering cute cafes and restaurants. So don’t overlook this charming city on your trip through Peru. Find out the best things to do, eat, drink, and where to stay in this city in the Southern Andes! Cusco City Guide: What to Do, Eat, Drink and Where to Stay in Cusco   What to Do: Sacsayhuaman Sacsayhuaman is the most famous ruin in Cusco city, and the center of the most powerful kingdom during Inca times. It’s perched on the top of the mountain overlooking the city, and is only a few minutes from the city center. You can walk up to this ruin through a wide and gradually sloped stone pathway. Be sure to bring water though and take your time – at this elevation, any walking can be a challenge! Or if you’re feeling tired, you can take a taxi to the ruins. Once inside the ruins, be sure to check out the mirador, or viewpoint overlooking the city. There will be plenty of signs directing you to overlook. This is a great place to take photos of Cusco from above. Then continue through and see the large ruin site. There are lots of ruins to climb and explore, and you’ll be amazed at the huge stones they carved and moved to build their city! Cristo Blanco Cristo Blanco is another site that overlooks the city. It’s actually only a few minutes walk from Sacsayhuaman, so you can combine the two sites if you have time. Cristo Blanco is a huge statue of Jesus that has a great viewpoint of the city below. Plaza de las Armas The Plaza de las Armas is the central square of the city of Cusco. This is where all the action is, so it’s a great place for people watching! There are also often popup tents, events or parades here. You’ll find the cathedral, a church, and government buildings around the square. They’re all picturesque so sit down and enjoy the view!   Wander San Blas The San Blas neighborhood is the bohemian, artistic neighborhood in Cusco. It’s full of cute cafes, yoga studios, healthy restaurants, and colorful doors. Wander this neighborhood on the side of the mountain and duck into stores and cafes as you go.   Visit the Markets I always love visiting local markets when traveling – it’s a great look into everyday local life! The biggest market in Cusco is San Pedro. This local market has everything from produce, artisan products, to electronics! There are also lots of small artisan markets scattered throughout the Centro. These are great places to do your shopping for textiles or other goods that you might want to bring home. Convento La Merced This gorgeous convent isn’t much talked about, but it’s well worth a visit! It’s a huge old convent with a large central courtyard with greens and flowers. There are also lots of rooms with big paintings and artifacts. Head upstairs to see the courtyard from above, and enjoy the pretty archways.   Where to Eat: Mr. Soup This soup restaurant was so good, we went twice! They have lots of varieties of soups from traditional Peruvian soups to Japanese to Thai to Italian. We tried 4 different varieties and they were all delcious! Inkazuela This is a super delicious restaurant to have a nice dinner while staying in Cusco. Their specialities are their stews and they are super great!   La Sangucheria 154 This is another restaurant that was so good, we went back twice! It’s pretty casual and is great for a lunch of salad and sandwiches. They also serve freshly made juices that were delicious.   Los Perros This is an expat restaurant that serves delicious food. It’s casual and is called a “couch bar” so it’s filled with comfy couches to eat your meal. We had the burger and the fries and it was sooo good and the portions were huge.   Restaurante Qori Sara If you want a good traditional meal, this is a great place in the centro! We went here for our very first meal upon arrival in Cusco and it’s still one of my favorite traditional meals I had. It’s a casual cafe, but super busy at lunchtime so you know it’s good! There was still a table for us, so we sat towards the back and ordered the menu of the day. This is a typical lunch option in Peru – it just means that they have 2 or 3 options for you to pick for your entree. You’ll also be served a small starter, a soup, a drink, and sometimes a dessert. It’s a great deal and a great way to try eating like a Peruvian. The portions are huge, and there are many courses so pace yourself! If you’re not starving, you can probably share one between two people. We had one menu del dia each and couldn’t finish it all. Where to Drink: Cholos Craft Beer This is a great craft beer bar that serves their own craft beer as well as other local favorities. It’s in a great location between the centro and San Blas, and has a great casual atmosphere so we found ourselves stopping here 3 times during our 2 week stay to enjoy a beer and use their fast wifi.   Norton’s Rat Tavern Despite the strange name, this bar has an amazing location so is a great place to hang out. They are right on the Plaza de las Armas in the middle of the centro and upstairs. You can snag a seat at the balcony outside and have a perfect view of the central square below. Great for people watching! They also have craft beer.   Pachapapa This cute restaurant also has a front bar area. We tried a couple of their Pisco Sour cocktails (the most famous drink in Peru) and they were delicious and fresh. The atmosphere is also great to relax with a happy hour drink.   Where to Stay: There are tons of options of places to stay in Cusco since it’s such a tourist-heavy place. Airbnb We stayed in an Airbnb since we would be in Cusco for a bit of an extended period (2 weeks). It was a great choice for us – we had a large house to ourselves with a kitchen, living room, 2 bedrooms, right in the middle of the Centro for the equivalent of $35 USD (with weekly discount). There are lots of great options on Airbnb if you prefer a homey experience. *Use this sign-up link to get $20 off your first booking. Splurge – Belmond Hotel Monasterio If you prefer to stay in a hotel, the Belmond Hotel Monasterio is a gorgeous boutique hotel in a former monastery in the Centro of Cusco. It has great reviews, beautiful grounds, and charming decor.   Mid-range – Hotel Arqueologo Exclusive Selection The Hotel Arquelogo Exclusive Selection is a great midrange choice. It’s on the hill between the Centro and San Blas, so the location is ideal and a little quieter. It’s well designed, charming, and a good value for the price.   Budget – Amaru Hostal If you need a more affordable option, Amaru Hostal has great reviews and is charming and colorful. It’s located in the San Blas neighborhood, so you’ll have a more residential feel and be surrounded by the artsy cafes and cute streets. So if you’re going through Cusco during your Peru trip , be sure to spend a couple extra days in charming Cusco! It’s a good idea to acclimate to the high elevation here, but you will also find no shortage of things to do, great things to eat, and pretty corners to explore."https://hippie-inheels.com/what-to-pack-for-peru/,peru,"What to Pack (and Not Pack) for Peru Peru is the most complicated destination I’ve ever had to pack for – so I want to help you avoid the stress with some tips on what to pack for Peru! This country has hot coastal beaches, wet Amazon rainforest, a mostly temperate capital city, and very cold destinations in the Andean highlands. That’s not to mention the specific gear you need for the many amazing treks and camping opportunities in the mountains. So how do you fit it all in one suitcase? You have to be strategic! Here are my top tips on what to pack for Peru! What to Pack for Peru Travel Think layers, sporty, versatile, and practical. My trip was a bit tricky since I travel full-time, I only always have the same things in my suitcase. I knew I didn’t have all the necessary things since I don’t often visit places that are cold enough for winter gear. But I had done my research and knew it was possible to buy a lot of things in Cusco or even rent gear. So know this is an option for you if for some reason you can’t bring everything with you, or if you end up forgetting something. Also, if you just don’t have the space to bring a big item like a down jacket, you can rent this for the days that you need them from one of the many trekking shops in Cusco. I did this since I don’t have room in my suitcase to constantly travel with a down jacket, and it worked out great. I stayed in Peru for 7 weeks, but I always have about a weeks worth of clothing with me, and then I do laundry at the end of each week. No matter the length of your trip, I recommend you bring clothing for 7 days. It’s really easy to do laundry anywhere in the country. In Cusco you’ll find several laundromats on every block since trekking is so common in this region and tourists end up with sweaty/dirty clothing! You can drop it off and pick it back up later in the day: cleaned, folded, and ready to go. So here’s what you should pack in your suitcase for your trip to Peru! Shoes City boots You’ll want these for walking around Lima and Cusco and can pair them with a dress if you want to “dress up” a bit. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Good athletic shoes or hiking boots One question I had before I went was – would my athletic shoes be sufficient for some of the difficult treks I’d be doing? I had booked tours to hike the Inca Trail for 2 days as well as the 2-day hike to Rainbow Mountain. My tour company advised that many people, the co-owner included, do these hikes regularly in athletic shoes and think they are sufficient. I did both hikes in my athletic shoes and it was 100% fine. I was comfortable, didn’t feel unstable, and my feet weren’t sore afterward. Just make sure they have good treads on the bottom, are broken in, and give good support. If you have really weak ankles or are trekking during a rainy season, waterproof hiking boots might be more comfortable for you. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Teva athletic sandals (if you’re heading to beaches or the Amazon) You only really need these if you’re heading to any of the hot areas like the northern beaches or the Amazon, or maybe Lima in their summer (January-February). Turn on your JavaScript to view content Socks: 3 good pairs of long wool hiking socks Do not underestimate the importance of good socks when heading to Peru! They make a huge difference in comfort. Remember that it’s quite cold in the highlands and warm socks will be a lifesaver. Be sure to have 3 pairs of long warm socks – preferably wool. You’ll want to wear this on cold weather treks and to bed every single night. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 4 pairs of regular socks You might want to wear this around the city, or on warmer weather treks like the Inca Trail, etc. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Pants : 1 pair of jeans Even if you are a dress kinda girl, you’ll be mostly wearing pants and activewear while traveling in Peru. Jeans will be handy for city walks or anytime you’re not hiking. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 1 pair of athletic pants or comfortable fabric pants 1 other pair of pants – either athletic pants or some comfortable fabric pants to wear on treks and layer thermal leggings underneath for especially cold places or camping in the mountains. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 1 pair of leggings Leggings will be your best friends on this trip! Pack at least one good pair. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 1 pair of thermal leggings Absolutely bring a pair of thermal leggings. You will want to wear this on especially cold treks like hiking in the Ausangate range. You might also wear them to bed every night in the highlands. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Shorts: 1 pair ONLY if you’re heading to beaches or the Amazon. You absolutely won’t need them otherwise. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Shirts : 4 versatile t-shirts Make these shirts a mix of comfy t-shirts that can be worn layered on treks, to bed, or around the city. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 1 or 2 Dresses You might want to bring 1 or 2 dresses for a change of pace, going out in Cusco, or strolling the streets in Lima. But you really don’t need more than 1 or 2! You will most likely be dressing in active clothing for most of the trip. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Uniqlo Heattech Thermal long sleeve shirt This is an important one! Having a warm base layer under your other layers will make you much more comfortable when hiking, camping, or sleeping in Cusco. I used a Uniqlo heat tech shirt and it worked wonderfully. It’s so small and thin, but really keeps you so much warmer and is easy to layer. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 1 Hoodie Having a warm hoodie is important in the chilly highlands. You’ll want to layer this with t-shirts and your thermal long sleeve shirt when it gets especially cold. This can also be nice to throw on as a light jacket in temperate places like Lima. A Down Jacket A down jacket will make you so much more comfortable during the Peruvian winter, and on highland treks. I did most of my trip without one since I don’t want to travel with one all the time. But I knew I absolutely needed one for my Rainbow Mountain overnight trek (where temperatures can get down to 10 degrees F at night!). So I rented one from a trekking shop in Cusco for the 2 days for $6 a day. It was totally worth it! Rain jacket – and/or poncho These are more must-haves. Even if you’re traveling in dry season, the weather in the mountains can be unpredictable. Don’t be caught out in the open on a trek without some protection. Pack a lightweight rain jacket – it won’t take up much space and will keep you comfortable in a storm. Also consider bringing a big rain poncho to put overtop yourself and your backpack. This will keep you extra dry and keep your things from getting wet while you’re trekking. If you don’t have one to bring with you, you can find these for cheap in any tourist area. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Accessories Turn on your JavaScript to view content A pair of gloves Gloves will make you much more comfortable while hiking. I wore a versatile pair that was fingerless but had a mitten flap that folded over. This made it easy for me to take pictures, but then pull the flap over when I needed extra warmth. Scarf A scarf will be a welcome layer when doing high altitude hikes or even in Cusco in the evening. Warm beanie A must-have for warmth when trekking or even at night in Cusco. Baseball hat/hat with brim This is super important for any hikes. The sun is strong at this altitude! Can also come in handy if you’re lounging on a beach. Other Bathing suit This is probably only necessary if you’re heading to the beaches, but there are also some hot springs in the highlands that you might want to visit after a difficult trek! Turn on your JavaScript to view content Camera You’ll definitely want proof of all the beautiful places you go! Whether it’s your phone, or something more substantial, be sure to pack this. I like to travel with a Lumix mirrorless camera – it’s fairly small and lightweight, but takes great photos. Portable charger powerpack for phone A portable charger like this one by Cheero is always a lifesaver for me when traveling, but even more so when doing overnight treks or long tour days. My phone will run out of battery fast when I’m taking a lot of photos, or if you’re camping in the wilderness, you won’t be able to recharge overnight unless you have one of these with you. Toiletries : Moisturizing lotion It’s very very dry in the highlands. You’ll want to use more lotion than normal! Insect repellent Some of the highlands like Cusco are too high in elevation for bugs, but Machu Picchu is lower, and has lots of mosquitos. You’ll also find mosquitos in the Amazon and on the beaches. Sunscreen The sun is strong! You’ll want to make sure to apply sunscreen often when you’re out on treks or tours. What NOT to Pack: The last suggestion is actually what NOT to pack. You’ll want to be sure to leave extra empty space in your suitcase before you arrive in Peru because this country has some of the most beautiful textiles in the world! You’ll be tempted to buy lots of alpaca sweaters, knit hats, colorful blankets, and other beautiful things. Do yourself a favor and leave yourself room to pick up things as you go. And that’s it! Everything you need for a trip to Peru for any length of time."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-krakow/,poland,"What makes Krakow a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?   Krakow is the most famous city in Poland, so there are many amazing places to see there. Not to mention 5 star hotels and luxury restaurants with delicious European food.

"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-edinburgh/,scotland,"What makes Edinburgh a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Edinburgh is such a beautiful city, like no other. Everywhere you look the city is framed by a castle, ancient volcano, monument or hill. It has so many great historical buildings and as the capital city of Scotland it offers a wide range of options to suit all travellers. What 5 star hotel is the best in Edinburgh? The most famous of the 5 star hotels in Edinburgh would be The Balmoral . This Victorian era hotel is right in the heart of Edinburgh at the end of Princes Street and next to the train station. You can expect pure luxury and Scottish charm from this hotel, right from the kilted doormen who welcome you as you enter! What about boutique hotels in Edinburgh, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Witchery by the Castle is as close as you can get to staying in Edinburgh Castle itself. Enter this unique hotel through a historic close at the top of the Royal Mile. Each Gothic suite is different, but usually contains a four poster bed and free standing bath. With the restaurant providing Scottish dishes and breakfast by candlelight, if you were in any other city you wouldn’t need to leave, but the delights of Edinburgh will beckon you out. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Edinburgh? Spending time in Edinburgh in the summer means taking advantage of the all the green spaces. On a nice day (and they do exist!) the Meadows is typically crowded with people and portable barbeques. The promenade at Portobello is the closest beach option and the Epsy on the promenade has a great burger menu if you’re in need of a bite to eat. In the winter Edinburgh is on the colder side, although probably not as much as you might imagine! There’s a great cafe culture here, with an eclectic range of cafes all over the city available for you to escape the cold. I’d recommend Lovecrumbs near the Grassmarket as my favourite, although pick anywhere that looks slightly hipster and you’re probably good! Bruntsfield has some options including Project Coffee and down by The Shore in Leith you can find Mimi’s Bakehouse.  Taking a wander through Stockbridge at any time of year means discovering cute little shops and cafes, and on Saturday the Stockbridge Market has great food plus original art and crafts. If you need a pub then Hamiltons Bar and Kitchen would be my pick! Stockbridge is also close to Dean Village, one of the most picturesque areas of Edinburgh. Afternoon tea is a great activity for a mother/daughter or girls weekend and the best on offer in Edinburgh is at The Balmoral. With unlimited tea options, a three tier afternoon tea plus a treats trolley coming around and live harp music the atmosphere is a wonderful break from wandering around the city. What is something not to miss in Edinburgh? Edinburgh has so many great sites to see it’s hard to even list them all! A day spent wandering around Edinburgh taking in the sights and stopping at a pub or cafe is the best way to see this city. The first stop for any traveller is probably the Royal Mile, starting at Edinburgh Castle and meandering down to Holyrood Palace at the end. About halfway down you can stop for a tour of one of Edinburgh’s oldest streets, at Mary Kings Close. Much of it is now covered by buildings above, but the tour gives you a great idea of what life would have been like in Edinburgh hundreds of years ago. If you’re feeling adventurous once you reach the end of the Royal Mile you can then climb the ancient volcano of Arthur’s Seat, and wander along the Salisbury Crags for great views over Edinburgh. Edinburgh is also home to the Museum of Scotland and the National Galleries of Scotland.   If you like Whisky (that’s without the E!) or you’re keen to see if you do then the Scottish Whisky Experience is near Edinburgh Castle on the Royal Mile. J K Rowling spent a lot of time in Edinburgh while she was writing Harry Potter, and the Elephant Cafe was one of her regular haunts early on. The cafe, near the Royal Mile and overlooking the Castle from the back window, has stayed true to how it was at that time, but the bathroom is covered in Harry Potter quotes. A keen fan will recognise some of the names on headstones in the nearby Greyfriars Kirkyard, also the resting place of Scotland’s most famous dog, Greyfriars Bobby, who faithfully sat by his owners grave until he too passed away and had the honour of also being buried in the Kirkyard. Edinburgh is soaked in history, and is made for walking to see the different sights of the beautiful city. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Edinburgh and what are their best dishes? Edinburgh has several Michelin Star restaurants, one being The Kitchin, in a converted warehouse in Leith where French technique is combined with Scottish ingredients. If you want to go but dinner is out of your price range, try the lunch service. Castle Terrace is Tom Kitchin’s restaurant located in city and another Michelin star in his belt. Once again The Balmoral provides another Michelin option with Number One, arguably serving some of the best food in Edinburgh. As for restaurants less than Michelin star but still amazing, Timberyard in the Old Town always rates highly. It’s a family run business that sources from local and artisan growers. If you’re looking for more of a pub atmosphere I love Ghulli Dhu, which their delicious food and great atmosphere. If you’re lucky enough to be there when they have a Ceilidh, a Scottish folk dance, in the upstairs room then abandon your inhibitions and join in! Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best dessert? Sticky Toffee Pudding will always be my dessert of choice, and many restaurants around Edinburgh offer this delight. It’s a cake based on dates, (don’t let that put you off!) covered in a caramel toffee sauce. Keep an eye out for it on menus all over. I am obsessed with having coffee and cake, and in Edinburgh your spoilt for choice. Not to mention the delicious and huge scones on offer at many cafes. For some delicious cake during the day I’d recommend Lovecrumbs once again! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Edinburgh; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? Multrees Walk defines luxury shopping in Edinburgh. You can find Edinburgh’s only Harvey Nicholls here, alongside highend designer shops, framing a pedestrian only pathway lit with lights around trees. If you want to find anything like Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors and Mulberry, this is the place to go. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Edinburgh? Anyone staying at The Balmoral won’t even need to leave their hotel to find one of the best spas in Edinburgh. Other great options are also linked to luxurious hotels at the Sheraton Grand Hotel &amp; Spa, and the Waldorf Astoria – The Caledonian Hotel. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? On a clear and not windy day an amazing place to see the sunset would be from Arthurs Seat, but walking down after dark can be a bit of a mission. The Salisbury Crags next to this would slightly easier, but the best option would have to be Calton Hill. In the winter months the sun sets almost directly behind the Castle, providing a stunning backdrop to many of the icons of Edinburgh. Just out of the city at South Queensferry there are great spots to watch the sunset around the Forth Bridges. The Forth Bridge is an rail bridge that is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us in on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Whisky might be the most famous drink in Scotland, but gin is often a more popular option. At One Square Gin they have over 60 gins to choose from, including one made just for them. Another gin and general cocktail bar is 56 North, in the Southside. If gins not your thing these are still great places to go. The main tourist drinking spot is probably the Grassmarket, just below Edinburgh Castle, home to Scotland’s smallest pub as well as some of the oldest. A more highend option is George Street, adjacent to Princes Street, where you can find more luxury restaurants and cocktail bars. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Edinburgh has a surprisingly huge number of bars and clubs. In two years of living there I feel like I barely scraped the surface! It’s really hard for me to narrow down the options, and everyone loves something different.  If you’re at Tigerlily, a great place for cocktails on George Street, there’s a club underneath called Lulu, playing most of the chart hits to dance the night away to. Other options in the area are Lola Lo, or The Shack for a bit of cheesy fun. One of my favourites is Caberet Voltaire, known as Cab Vol, located off the Royal Mile. This small venue hosts DJs playing a wide range of music, and offers some great cocktails to keep you going! Where to head for breakfast the next day While you’re in the United Kingdom you might have tried an English Breakfast but don’t miss trying a Scottish one, complete with haggis and a tattie scone. If you don’t understand Scottish then a tattie scone is a flat potato griddle scone, and they are delicious. My favourite place for brunch is Kilimanjaro in the Southside, although it’s cafe style and can be super busy on the weekends. For something more luxurious try the Huxley in the Rutland Hotel. Popular options with locals and visitors alike include Urban Angel in Hanover Street and The Roseleaf in Leith. Both offer traditional breakfasts and other great options. Tables at most places are snapped up quickly on the weekend so call ahead or be prepared for a wait!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2011/09/little-india-by-night-singapore/,singapore,"Little India By Night, Singapore When my mom learned I would be going to Singapore for the third time, she handed me a list of things I should buy for her. When I looked at the list I knew exactly where to get them — Mustafa Centre . It was not difficult at all to squeeze this quick shopping stint into my itinerary because Mustafa is open 24 hours anyway.       Ten o’clock has already passed when we arrived at Fragrance Hotel Selegie from the airport. After getting my key card, I immediately proceeded to my room, dropped my bags and went out again. It was the perfect opportunity to head over to Mustafa Centre and buy what my mom asked me to get for her, mostly perfumes. Just within the block, I passed by a 7-Eleven store and saw another blogger there — Marcos of Ambot-ah.com. He was looking for a money changer. Minutes later, Hannah and the rest of the group joined us and decided to go to the nearest money changer that was still open at the time — at Mustafa Centre! What luck! The group (composed of travel bloggers) decided to walk all the way to Mustafa Centre from Fragrance Hotel Selegie. I saw it as my chance to finally see Little India at night. I had been to Little India before but it was day. Although I knew that most establishments in the cultural district were most likely already closed that night, it still excited me. With a camera hanging ’round my neck, I snapped away as we made our way to Mustafa Centre. It wasn’t long until the obvious dawned on me, that Little India is best seen, explored and experienced during the day. For starters, as expected most establishments were already closed when we were there. Only a few restaurants were still open. And because it was dark, many of the colorful elements around Little India got buried in shadows. Allow me to share a few photos of Little India bathing in daylight, shot in a previous trip: I guess the biggest disappointment for me that night was that I was not able to fall under the spell of the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. Because it was already closed, the temple was dark and we could barely see the intricate design of its majestic exterior. Here’s what we saw: But during the day, it reveals its beautiful, colorful masterpieces crowning the temple! Here are some photos of the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple when embraced by the sun (taken 2 years ago)! Still, I enjoyed our short walk. It was my first time to see Little India at night and since it was more like a sidetrip, I was not complaining. The experience brought back precious memories of my first time in Singapore. Soon, we reached Mustafa Centre and I was able to cross out all the items on my mom’s shopping list while my friends queued to exchange currencies (and shop, too)!

Ask travelers who have set foot on Singapore for adjectives that best describe the city, and “expensive” won’t be absent from any list. True, many of the key attractions here can burn a hole in the pocket. Universal Studios, Gardens by the Bay, and even Marina Bay Sands viewdeck all demand a little finger from the average budget backpacker.       Fortunately, there are many places that are not tagged with a price. If you have enough for accommodation and transportation, here are seven places that allow travelers to enjoy Southeast Asia’s most expensive city for FREE. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Singapore River Walk 2. Chinatown 3. Little India 4. Gardens by the Bay Supertree Grove 5. Singapore Botanic Gardens 6. Southern Ridges Trail 7. MacRitchie Forest Trails Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Singapore River Walk Many of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks stand right by the river. Walking from Raffles Place to Marina Bay Sands treats visitors to a chance to get up close and personal with the Merlion statue and some architectural charmers like the Fullerton Hotel, Esplanade, and the Double Helix bridge. Kill some time by the river, watch tourist boats pass by in the afternoon, and see the laser show at the Marina Bay Sands in the evening. And if you hear your tummy grumble, dig into cheap foodie favorites at Makansutra Bay or take a bite of an ice cream sandwich sold under Esplanade Bridge. Merlion Park facing Marina Bay Sands Best Time to Visit : Before sunset, so you could experience it during the day and night. Nearest MRT Station : Raffles Place (North West Line, East West Line). Detailed instructions : Singapore River Walking Tour   2. Chinatown A walk across Chinatown is not just enjoyable, it is also quite enlightening. Begin your journey-on-foot at Telok Ayer MRT Station. Although part of Chinatown, Telok Ayer Street harbors multi-religious structures — the Thian Hock Keng Chinese temple, the Nagor Durgha Indian shrine, the Singapore Methodist Church and the Al Abrar Mosque — a testament to how this city values diversity in religion and culture. The trail ends at Temple Street, where you can find cheap souvenirs and mementos! Thian Hock Keng Temple Best Time to Visit : Morning when the sun isn’t that harsh Nearest MRT Station : Telok Ayer (Downtown Line) or Chinatown (North East Line). More info : Chinatown Heritage Walk 3. Little India Just across Chinatown is Little India, an ethnic neighborhood that features the Tamil culture. Take a look inside and shop at many shops for some explosion of color! Eat at the many restaurants flanking the Serangoon Road for a taste of Indian cuisine. Gawk at the intricate design of the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. And if you want cheap buys, don’t be shy to step into the Mustafa Centre! Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple Nearest MRT Station : Little India (North East Line) or Farrer Park (North East Line) More info : Little India   4. Gardens by the Bay Supertree Grove Time to hug a tree! Well, not really hug, but you know what I mean. While the domed conservatories of Gardens By the Bay require an entrance fee, its outdoor areas remain open to the public for no charge. The Supertree Grove, in particular, is worth a visit. Take a relaxing stroll around these giant trees, rising to up to 16 stories, and hang out at the Supertree-top bistro for a gorgeous panoramic view of the site. Opening Hours : 5am-2am, best experienced at night Nearest MRT Station : Bayfront (Circle Line)   5. Singapore Botanic Gardens This 74-hectare botanical garden is being considered for a UNESCO World Heritage Site recognition; it’s application was submitted in December 2012. The top attraction here — the National Orchid Garden, which houses over 1000 species of orchids — collects a SGD5 admission fee, but the rest is accessible for free. Explore many of its other zones including the Evolution and Ginger Gardens for a refreshing time with our chlorophyll-colored friends! Opening Hours : 5am-12mn Nearest MRT Station : Botanic Gardens (Circle Line) 6. Southern Ridges Trail Nature’s not lost in Singapore. Covering 10km of verdant landscape, the Southern Ridges is an outdoor experience not to be missed by nature-lovers. The site connects Labrador Nature Reserve, Kent Ridge Park, HortPark, Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Mount Faber Park. Conquer the Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian walkway in Singapore (at 36m) that mesmerizes with its “series of undulating curved ribs”. Or, follow the Canopy and Forest walking trails for better appreciation of the flora and fauna that have found home here. Guided tours are available for a fee. Otherwise, you can save that money for a meal. Nearest MRT Station : Harbourfront (North East, Circle) or Labrador (Circle Line)   7. MacRitchie Forest Trails At the heart of the 2000-hectare Central Catchment Nature Reserve lies the MacRitchie Reservoir. Completed in 1868, it is Singapore’s first reservoir. Boardwalks snake around it and through the surrounding forest, ushering visitors to get to know the city’s more natural side. The 250m TreeTop Walk provides a little bit of adrenaline rush while enabling visitors to catch bird’s eye view of the lush forest. Prep a good pair of shoes because there will be a lot of walking! Guides are ideal, but you can manage on your own since there are plenty of signs. Opening Hours : 6:30am-6pm Nearest MRT Station : Marymount (Circle Line) "https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2012/09/sentosa-boardwalk-singapore/,singapore,"Sentosa Boardwalk: The Gateway to Singapore’s Island Resort A bright pink glow was beginning to spread across the horizon when we reached the middle of the boardwalk. Without a word, all of us agreed to stop and watch the luminous display of colors in the heavens. We were on a walkway connecting mainland Singapore to the island of Sentosa, and this viewpoint allowed us to fully appreciate the surrounding beauty. We weren’t alone. Almost everyone taking the boardwalk halted and took a moment to have a good look at the clouds being painted pink and red by the retiring sun. Thank Heavens for the long queue at the monorail station.       Several minutes earlier, my friends Ces, Astrid and I found ourselves amongst the hundreds of people flooding through the front gate of Universal Studios Singapore. The Hollywood Dreams Parade had just ended, and everyone made their way to the main exit as soon as it was over.  Where did you all come from?  I was blown away by the sheer volume of the crowd. But I was blown farther away when I set eyes on the queue that snaked towards the monorail station. Our plan was to take the train to go back to the main island, but that would prove to be so stressful with this big a crowd. “You still have some energy left?” I asked the ladies. “Barely,” replied Ces. “Why?” “The line is too long. I say, let’s just walk to the main island.” I knew that there was a boardwalk somewhere around the area so we scurried around the place looking for it. It wasn’t long until we reached the riverbank and found the bridge that stems from it over the undisturbed channel below. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Sentosa Boardwalk The Romero Britto Neo-Pop Exhibit A Leisurely Walk Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Sentosa Boardwalk Sentosa Boardwalk is an option that visitors may take to reach Sentosa. Located just a few yards from VivoCity Mall’s promenade, this covered bridge allows visitors to get to Sentosa Island and back on foot. Not only are visitors able to cross to Sentosa at a leisurely pace, they can also be mesmerized by the gorgeous vistas of the landscapes and cityscapes around it and the small details that make the walkway endearing. Ornamented by a lush greenery, it is Southeast Asia’s first garden-themed boardwalk. Sentosa Boardwalk Sentosa Boardwalk The Romero Britto Neo-Pop Exhibit On the way to the boardwalk, we passed by a cute, merry exhibit by Brazilian-American neo-pop artist Romero Britto. It was an unexpected treat. Our ankles and knees were on the verge of giving up, but our spirit was suddenly drenched in a weird mixture of excitement and happiness upon seeing these modern sculptures. The colors just exude gaiety, and the designs just warped us into a time when we found absolute fulfillment in cartoons and pets and drawings. My friends Ces and Astrid could not help but take pictures with these fun and joyful pieces of art. My friend Ces mimicking the statue Unfortunately, I believe they will be on display for a limited time only. A Leisurely Walk I was under the impression that the Sentosa Boardwalk was just a simple, narrow passageway straddling the channel, but on my first step on it, I knew I was gravely mistaken. The boardwalk is wide enough to harbor flights of stairs, gardens, and travelators . Its nooks are perfect vantage points and its fringes great venues for bondings. There was so much to see and admire on that long walk that we stopped countless times to allow ourselves more time to take it all in and wallow in its magnificence. The best part was when the sky was painted hot pink by the sun just when it was about to take a dip. The pink glow slowly blended with purple and blue, staging a spectacular free show right before us. A little girl going down the stairs at Sentosa Boardwalk Wooden floor of Sentosa Boardwalk My friends Ces and Astrid watching the sunset As darkness slowly swallowed both islands and the moon reclaimed her dominance, lamps of various shapes and colors illuminated the walkway. It was time for us to leave, and we did with a happy heart despite aching soles, all the while thinking that the Sentosa Boardwalk is not a gateway but a destination on its own. And a great one at that. How to get there : Take the MRT North East Line going to Harbourfront and alight at the last stop — Harbourfront Station. Walk towards the VivoCity Waterfront Promenade.

Where to Stay in Singapore Accommodations in Singapore are expensive by Southeast Asian standards, or by any standard for that matter. Budget travelers have three options: backpacker hostels, BnB, and budget hotels. Because space is scarce in Singapore, don’t expect rooms of generous proportions. Rooms are usually just beds with little space around it, and bathrooms are compact. Capsule hotels are also starting to be popular. Backpackers hostels are concentrated in Chinatown, Little India, Clark Quay, Bugis, and Geylang areas. Most of them offer dorm beds and double rooms. Budget hotels are mostly in Geylang, Little India, and Balestier.

Walkable because it’s actually a fun and rewarding experience to walk around many key areas in the city. The best part, it’s free! So I just squeezed in a lot of walking tours into this itinerary. Here’s a sample itinerary. You may use it but make the necessary adjustments. Day 1: ARRIVAL IN SINGAPORE, RIVER WALK TOUR, MARINA BAY SANDS 07:00 am – ETA Singapore Changi Airport10:10 am – Check in: Hostel, Lunch01:00 pm – Singapore River Walking Tour (Sightseeing: Fullerton, Merlion Park, Esplanade, Makansutra, etc)03:30 pm – Gardens by the Bay06:00 pm – Marina Bay Sands Day 2: KAMPONG GLAM, SENTOSA ISLAND 07:00 am – Kampong Glam Walk10:00 am – Universal Studios Singapore05:00 pm – Explore rest of  Sentosa Day 3: CHINATOWN WALK, ORCHARD ROAD, SINGAPORE FLYER 07:00 am – Chinatown Heritage Walk10:00 am – Orchard Road (Shopping)03:00 pm – Bugis, St. Andrews Cathedral Day 4: LITTLE INDIA, RETURN TO MANILA 06:00 am – Little India Walking Tour10:00 am – Check out: Hostel, Proceed to Airport02:20 pm – ETD: Changi Airport You may also add several other attractions.   Breakdown of Expenses So now we have come to the list of my expenses as part of this Singapore trip. Below is the breakdown of everything I spent on in SG. Note that I did all my tours DIY-style. TOTAL COST (excluding airfare, travel taxes, and airport fees) SGD 120 – Hostel (4 days, 3 nights)SGD 22 – EZ Link cards (reloaded once, inclusive of almost SGD8 unused)SGD 60 – Total food expensesSGD 26 – Gardens by the BaySGD 23 – Marina Bay Sands SkyparkSGD 4 – Sentosa Monorail Train ticketSGD 76 – Universal Studios ticketSGD 12 – Taxi from Hostel to Airport SGD 343 – TOTAL COST As I always say, this can change based on your spending habits. I’m only sharing so you have a ballpark figure of how much to prepare here although I strongly recommend that you pad this with much allowance to be on the safe side.   Other Tips for the Poor Traveler Where to Eat . If you’re on a budget, ditch the restaurants for hawkers. Hawkers will give you a wide array of local options at a much lower price. They abound all around Singapore, but they were not created equal. One of the reasons we recommend Chinatown as a good base is because it is home to one of the best hawker places in SG — Maxwell Food Center . Staying here gives you easy access to cheap but good food every day. Taking the MRT . If you’re taking the MRT a lot, buy an EZ Link card. This will allow you to breeze through the station entrances when taking the train. The train system is pretty expansive so you might want to take advantage of it. It can be a bit tiring, though, especially at interchange connections, when you’re walking from one line to another. Exchanging Currencies . The Mustafa Center at Little India has one of the best rates I have seen around Singapore. You might want to change money here. But if your budget isn’t that big (say USD 500), I don’t think the difference between here and the ones at the airport matters. You might lose whatever you think you could save in transportation just to get to a good money changer. GST Refund . Tourists in Singapore can actually claim refund on GST (Goods and Services Tax) paid for items purchased from establishments that are participating in the Tourist Refund Scheme.

We’ll be updating this every time we gather new info."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2011/08/chinatown-heritage-walking-tour-singapore-trip/,singapore,"7 Heritage Sites in Chinatown Singapore: A DIY Walking Tour (Updated: 2014) Our Day 3 in Singapore started early. We were up as early as 7am. The first item on our itinerary for that day was the Chinatown Heritage Walking Tour, which I was very excited about because I had never been to this part of Singapore before. Note that it is a Do-It-Yourself tour. Even before the trip, I already determined the places to go to so I somehow knew what to expect. Armed with just a map, my mom and I headed to Telok Ayer Street for a relaxing, and hopefully enlightening, walk around Chinatown.       Although part of Singapore Chinatown, Telok Ayer Street boasts of multi-religious buildings and structures. Aside from a Chinese temple, the street is also home to a mosque, a Methodist Church and an Indian shrine. Confused? Welcome to the club. But that’s what makes this place more endearing. It tells you so much about how Singapore values diversity in culture and religion. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? How to Get to Telok Ayer Street 1. Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church 2. Al-Abrar Mosque (Masjid Al-Abrar) 3. Thian Hock Keng 4. Nagor Durgha Shrine 5. Amoy Street 6. Buddha Tooth Relic Museum and Temple 7. Chinatown Heritage Centre Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts How to Get to Telok Ayer Street We were coming from G4 Backpackers’ Hostel in Little India and we only took the MRT to get to Telok Ayer Street. Here’s how we did it: From Little India MRT Station (North East Line), take the train going to Harbourfront. Alight at Outram Park Transfer to East West Line and take the train heading for Pasir Ris. Alight at Tanjong Pagar Look for Exit G. Follow the signs. From Tanjong Pagar Station, you will easily see a building almost right across — the Chinese Methodist Church. A long time ago, Telok Ayer was on the beachfront. So when you start walking, imagine yourself walking on the beach as you marvel at these fantastic temples and heritage houses. Hehe. It must have been completely different then. Regardless, Telok Ayer is still a great place to visit because buildings are restored and well-preserved. Here are the interesting structures that you will enjoy as you walk around the area: 1. Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church Chinese Methodist Church One of Singapore’s earliest Chinese Christian churches, the Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church  features a combination of oriental and western influences. The Chinese-style roof caps this building but its Art Deco features can be noticed in the windows. Because we were really hungry, we decided to grab a quick breakfast at Amoy Street Food Centre. It was still very early so only a few food stalls were open. Fortunately for us, we found a stall that we really liked. You may choose to eat here or if you’re not hungry, finish this walk first and then walk to Maxwell Food Centre, which is just around the corner. Amoy Food Centre 2. Al-Abrar Mosque (Masjid Al-Abrar) Al Abrar Mosque Al-Abrar Mosque started out as a thatched hut in 1827. This humble beginning is why it is called by its other name “Kuchu Palli,” which means “small mosque” in Tamil. It is also called Masjid Chulia because this was where immigrants from Coromandal Coast in Southern India worshiped. This mosque has come a long way from being a thatched hut. Between 1850 and 1855, it underwent a series of transformation. But much of what we see today is a product of the extensive 1986 renovation. 3. Thian Hock Keng Thian Hock Keng Thian Hock Keng is probably my favorite part of the walking tour. It was just a stand-out! The facade or the gates were gorgeous and its interior was even better. The main prayer hall is home to an image of the Queen of Heaven. Beside it are Bao Sheng Da Di, the Protector of Life and Guan Ti, the God of War. They say that this temple is primarily Taoist but there are Confucian and Buddhist elements in it too. Said to be the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore, this beautiful structure started out as a humble joss house in 1821-1822. It was built to honor the Protector of Sojourners, Ma Zu Po. That’s why in its early years, Chinese immigrants would visit this place to give thanks for safe travel. Centuries ago, this temple was actually on the beach and it was the first place that Chinese travelers would go to when they reach the island. From 1839 to 1842, the humble joss house went through a major reconstruction using Chinese techniques. The reconstruction was started by philanthropist Tan Tock Seng. The most amazing part of how it was constructed was the fact that the whole structure was supported by only wooden and brick walls and nowhere in the temple will you find nails. Not a single one. The design of everything in the place is just mind-blowing. Everything is intricately made. I just can’t. Just can’t. BEAUTIFUL! Inside Thian Hock Keng Temple Figures inside Thian Hock Keng You see the lower right part of the photo above? That’s one of the door guards that’s supposed to protect the temple. The one thing that I liked the most being in this temple was that while I was taking pictures, I realized that although I was in an ancient site, I could still see the gorgeous, modern buildings. It’s an overwhelming mixture of the past and the present of Singapore. Note that photography is allowed in most parts of the temple but NOT in the main prayer hall. 4. Nagor Durgha Shrine Nagore Durgha Shrine A few yards from Thian Hock Keng stands the Nagore Durha, a beautiful Indian shrine, which I thought looked like a giant layered cream cake. Originally called Shahul Hamid, this Indian Muslim shrine was built in 1828-1830 by muslim immigrants from Southern India. This explains the pretty combination of Classical and Indian Muslim elements in its architecture. The facade features an arched doorway in between arched windows. Above the windows and the doorway is an intricate lace-like design that resembles a palace. In the corners are tall layered minarets. 5. Amoy Street Amoy Street After getting blown away by Nagor Durgha, turn left onto the street perpendicular to Telok Ayer — Boon Tat Street.  Then turn left again onto Amoy Street. It’s a beautiful, relaxed street (maybe because it was a Sunday when we were there). Walk down Amoy Street and see the many second transitional style shophouses there. You’ll see a lot of various influences in the architecture of the houses on this street. Walk until you reach the end of the road and you’ll find yourself at the Amoy Street Food Centre again. From here, you may choose to go back to the Tanjong Pagar MRT Station or if you’re hungry, find your way to the Maxwell Food Center nearby.   6. Buddha Tooth Relic Museum and Temple Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum Standing just across the Maxwell Food Center is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. Opened in 2007, the Tang-style structure houses sacred Buddhist artifacts including bone and tongue relics, the most treasured of which is the tooth relic exhibited on the fourth floor. From here, continue walking along South Bridge Road and explore the rest of the Chinatown Proper. You’ll see plenty of shops, eateries, and museums along Mosque, Temple, and Pagoda Streets.   7. Chinatown Heritage Centre Inside Chinatown Heritage Centre Located along Pagoda Street, the Chinatown Heritage Centre showcases the history and heritage of the early Chinese migrants in Singapore in a restored three-story shophouse. From here, the MRT Chinatown Station can easily be reached on foot."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2011/08/singapore-trip-summary-expenses/,singapore,"SINGAPORE: Budget Travel Guide (Updated 2014) A more updated version of this article can be found here: Singapore Travel Guide   Singapore, as steel-cold and artificial as it appears most of the time, always manages to radiate a natural warmth for a nostalgic soul like me. Maybe it’s that I give too much value in it being the first country I visited besides my own. And I had been here six more times since then. Or maybe because I just feel like I somehow belong here, in the middle of the towering skyscrapers and theme parks. The truth is, every time I have a new Singaporean stamp on my passport, this small city-state never fails to surprise me.       Esplanade by the Singapore River WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Booking Flights to Singapore All major local airlines including Cebu Pacific and PAL Express fly to Singapore from Manila. Some even fly from Cebu, Davao, and Clark. Seair/Tiger Airways Philippines and AirAsia Philippines also added Singapore to their new destinations. For budget travelers, the main factor in choosing is, well, the budget. The best way to snag a deal is to wait for a seat sale and just grab a promo seat. The airport terminal is connected to the MRT that will take you to the city proper. You may also take a bus or taxi. Preparing Travel Documents Traveling to Singapore does NOT require a visa. All you need is a valid passport (with 6 months left before expiration). All you really need to do is show up at the airport and fly. However, you’ll see in my Singapore posts just how kid-friendly the city is. If you want to travel overseas with your kids, I will strongly recommend Singapore. This city-state just has something for everyone, even for the young and the young at heart — Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park, Universal Studios, Snow City, to name some.

Finding Cheap Hotels in Singapore Check Hotel Rates Here The nastiest part of preparing a trip to Singapore is looking for a cheap place to stay. Space is a scarce commodity in this city and even the cheapest hotels may still be expensive in Filipino standards. But here are two cheap accommodations that I have tried in Singapore. G4 Station Singapore Fragrance Hotel Selegie   G4 Station Backpackers’ Hostel . The rooms are small but it was good enough given the price. It was very, very clean though and the staff was really friendly and helpful. Fragrance Hotel Selegie . It’s clean, close to the Little India MRT station, and surrounded by restaurants. Each room is equipped with cable TV, a water heater, a phone and airconditioner. Basic and cramped but completely functional. What to Do in Singapore A lot! Singapore may be small but it is packed with all sorts of sites, attractions, and adventures! Whatever your reason for traveling is, Singapore has something for you. Shopping? Culture? History? Food? Nature? Theme parks? Singapore has them! Here are the points of interest in Singapore that I have set foot on. The photos will lead you to a more detailed post about that destination. Singapore River Walk Universal Studios Chinatown Heritage Walk Little India Sentosa Jewel Box, Mt Faber Singapore Flyer MINT Museum of Toys Orchard Road Suntec City Mall Limited budget? Here are 7 FREE Things to Do in Singapore . Sample 4D/3N Singapore Itinerary One thing I like most was that Singapore is a very “walkable” city. Walkable because it’s actually a fun and rewarding experience to walk around many key areas in the city. The best part, it’s free! So I just squeezed in a lot of walking tours into this itinerary. Here’s a sample itinerary. You may use it but make the necessary adjustments. Day 1: ARRIVAL IN SINGAPORE, RIVER WALK TOUR, MARINA BAY SANDS 07:00 am – Rendezvous at NAIA Terminal 310:10 am – ETD NAIA Terminal 3 (Manila)01:50 pm – ETA Singapore Changi Airport03:00 pm – Check in: Hostel04:30 pm – Singapore River Walking Tour(Sightseeing: Fullerton Hotel, Merlion Park, Esplanade, Makansutra, Boat Quay, Clark Quay, etc)08:00 pm – Marina Bay Sands Day 2: KAMPONG GLAM, SENTOSA ISLAND 07:00 am – Kampong Glam Walk10:00 am – Universal Studios05:00 pm – Explore rest of  Sentosa Day 3: CHINATOWN WALK, ORCHARD ROAD, SINGAPORE FLYER 07:00 am – Chinatown Heritage Walk10:00 am – Orchard Road (Shopping)03:00 pm – Mint Museum of Toys05:00 pm – St. Andrews Cathedral and Singapore Flyer Day 4: LITTLE INDIA, RETURN TO MANILA 06:00 am – Little India Walking Tour08:00 am – Mustafa Mall and Sim Lim Square10:00 am – Check out: Hostel, Proceed to Airport02:20 pm – ETD: Changi Airport06:15 pm – ETA: NAIA Terminal 3 You may also add several other attractions like Gardens by the Bay, Jurong Bird Park, and Singapore Zoo. The Asian Museum is also a good place to visit. Breakdown of Expenses So now we have come to the list of my expenses as part of this Singapore trip. Below is the breakdown of everything I spent on in SG. TOTAL COST (excluding airfare, travel taxes, and airport fees) SGD 120 – G4 Station Backpackers’ Hostel (4 days, 3 nights)SGD 22 – EZ Link cards (for 2, reloaded once, inclusive of almost SGD8 unused)SGD 60 – Total food expensesSGD 3 – Sentosa Monorail Train ticketSGD 74 – Universal Studios ticketSGD 15 – MINT Museum of Toys ticketSGD 29.5 – Singapore Flyer ticketSGD 12 – Taxi from Hostel to Airport SGD 335.5 – TOTAL COST As I always say, this can change based on your spending habits. I’m only sharing so you have a ballpark figure of how much to prepare here although I strongly recommend that you pad this with much allowance to be on the safe side. Additional Tips Taking the MRT . If you’re taking the MRT a lot, buy an EZ Link card. This will allow you to breeze through the station entrances when taking the train. The train system is pretty expansive so you might want to take advantage of it. It can be a bit tiring, though, especially at interchange connections, when you’re walking from one line to another. Exchanging Currencies . The Mustafa Center at Little India has one of the best rates I have seen around Singapore. You might want to change money here. But if your budget isn’t that big (say USD 500), I don’t think the difference between here and the ones at the airport matters. You might lose whatever you think you could save in transportation just to get to a good money changer. GST Refund . Tourists in Singapore can actually claim refund on GST (Goods and Services Tax) paid for items purchased from establishments that are participating in the Tourist Refund Scheme.

Enjoy the Lion City!"https://hippie-inheels.com/singapore-neighborhood-guide/,singapore,"I Wish I’d Had a Singapore Neighborhood Guide Like This One… Before coming to Singapore, I wanted to see how it was laid out as a city and where the cool places to be were. I couldn’t find a good guide anywhere! I know mine isn’t the best but I did learn a lot while there (staying with local friends) and they helped me organize this, and I knew even this Singapore neighborhood guide would be better than none. I have actually been to Singapore three times now. Tiny Singapore is divided into many neighborhoods that encompass the diverse people of the country. In such a small place you have Hindus, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and more getting along peacefully. The varied cultures make this an ideal destination for travelers because it allows you to see more of the world while staying in one place. Kind of like “Beers of the World” at Disney Land, but better. Singapore Neighborhood Guide I’ve put together a Singapore neighborhood guide to help you get around. Everything is really close and easily accessible using the MRT (train), although walking might be a bit of a mission. Uber often has surge prices and you can opt to use Grab app if you want to go by taxi at a lower rate. Little India this is not anything like India, and is definitely not dirty although on Singaporean standards it is Stepping out of the cab into Little India was pretty funny for u.. I’d read that it’s “dirty” and “ like the old Singapore” but compared to “Real India”, it was clean and crisp! They sold Indian clothing, gold, electronics, bindis, and Indian sweets/food along the roads… at much higher prices that India. I feel a little bad saying it, but most of what I saw here was junk. we didn’t quite understand this restaurant… jungle themed but they are Native American, no!?  I love the puja flowers, and the sticks of clothing hanging out the windows The gems were priced literally more than 10 times what they cost in India. I was quoted 200 SD for a very small moonstone pendant that should have cost maybe 20 SD, Maybe less. She brought the price down to 50, which was still too high. Eyebrow threading was about 15 SD whereas in India it cost me 20 rupees (about 30 cents) last time.  The guidebooks say Little India is the cheapest, but actually you can get threading done for 12 SD at the big shopping malls so don’t assume Little India will have best prices on everything. If you do get threading be sure to ask for tea tree oil after! There were signs for massage, reflexology, and Ayurveda treatments at higher than average prices, especially for an Indian market. Singapore is so far the most expensive place I have traveled. proper Indian snacks Little India is said to be the cheapest area to sleep. This is THE place for backpackers from bars to food. For backpackers on a budget in Singapore , the prices are still going to be a little out of reach. If you’re only passing through give yourself about 30-60 minutes here to wander around and shop. Bugis Turn on your JavaScript to view content year of the horse  The next stop for that day was Bugis. Luckily Dom, Ben’s University friend, has lived in Singapore for 3 years and was the perfect tour guide. It helped that his girlfriend is Singaporean! Although small (like everywhere in Singapore), I liked Bugis more than Little India and China Town. Be sure to try some juice here! I explain how strange Bah Long Long is in my foodie post on Singapore. Turn on your JavaScript to view content  We got a couple snacks here. Peanut balls and a spring roll. The peanut ball had a  yummy exterior and middle, but the layer in between was very strange. The spring rolls were the freshest I have ever had! Here is where you will find the “greatest electronic mall of all time”: Sim Lim Square . I actually thought it was a lot of scams. instead of fancy electronics, I was content with this ice cream wafer sandwich (I could have had it between two slices of colorful bread too!) China Town The boys were worn out from touring around with me, so they sat at one of the street bars to down some Tiger beer, while I wandering through China Town. I have to say I was mildly disappointed. Maybe I’m just over shopping in tourist places, but it is really overpriced junk. T-shirts, plastic crap, Chinese slippers and robes made from bad material but priced as if it were real silk. There was such a variety of chopsticks I was almost tempting to buy some. Two things I did want to buy, but never got around to it : The waving cat. Too cute! And I don’t even like cats. 3-10 SD. My name or Ben’s written in Chinese. I know it’s something you do at amusement parks… but it looks so beautiful when illustrated. 20 SD. crappy watches and “perfume” trinkets… drunk Ben and Dom bought 40 dollars worth of watches and wore them the rest of the day. Arab Street As you can imagine from the previous places, this is all Arab! The street is lined with delicious food and people smoking hookah. I’m partial to Persian food, but we saw Moroccan, Turkish, and many other countries represented. There are bars here with live music. We spent one evening here for dinner and drinks. Check out the huge Sultan Mosque – it’s beautiful at night. Orchard Road As for Shopping you have the famous Orchard road with 20-plus malls and Vivo city, which is on the way to Sentosa. Because shopping is one of my favorite ways to burn money, and Massy, my friend and local fashion designer told me the ins and outs, I’ve written up a separate post dedicated to shopping in Singapore . Clarke Quay &amp; Robertson Quay  Near each other, these both have bars and restaurants along the river. There are loads of expats here, delicious brunch, and great spots to watch soccer games or people watch. More on what we got up to here in my post about Singapore’s food. Marina Bay &amp; the Financial District photo credit: flickr Turn on your JavaScript to view content photo credit: flickr . I took some but none turned out well :( This is talked about in more detail over here on my post about Singapore’s abundant nightlife, but you can go to the Marina Bay Mall during the day and see the Gardens by the Bay . We chose to go at night so we could see it all lit up after the laser show! This is one of the most memorable times I had in Singapore when we went to The Lantern in The Fullerton Bay Hotel for drinks and to see the show, then after went to Ku-deta, the most well-known bar in Singapore on top of the most well-known building. Sentosa Island   We took a cab from Dom’s place to Vivo City Mall, were we caught the Sentosa Train out to the beach for 4 dollars. There are 2 stops on the way, the first being Universal Studios. At the last stop called Beach Station you will get off if you want the beach, pretty self-explanatory. We only spent an hour at Sentosa. We live on a beach, so I didn’t want to waste the small amount of time I had in Singapore getting a tan. It’s completely man-made and seems a lot like an amusement park. Prices are much higher than in town- and that’s saying something.   There are loads of activities to do at Sentosa: Skyline Luge, starting at 8 dollars looked fun but a little to slow for us. WaveHouse looked very cool and Ben was all set to try his hand until he was informed he couldn’t without a passport.  TIP: Take your ID with you!  Other options include trapeze, rock walls, and resorts that offer spa services. You can stay the night there at one of the resorts and the beachside restaurants have many intercontinental options. Sentosa was not my favorite place; I found it strange how artificial it seemed. There were trolleys taking people around like at Cedar Point between the two beaches: Siloso and Palawan. I think if I lived in Singapore I’d go on the weekends because it’s a nice break from city life, but as a tourist with limited time, I do see it as a little bit of a tourist trap. If you have the money go there and drink all day and the time to chill out by the sea, then you should definitely go. If you are a backpacker with limited time and budget, this might be something to skip."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-nightlife-in-singapore/,singapore,"Don’t Miss Out: Luxury Nightlife in Singapore Nightlife is the best part of Singapore. It’s a pretty bold statement since most people would say food, but I was a little disappointed by the food .  The nightlife I’m used to in Goa is literally on the other side of the spectrum in comparison to Singapore. In Goa I drink beer that’s a dollar while rocking back and forth like a zombie to trance music wondering, “ but really… I don’t get this music…” (Ben thinks it was invented by those who can’t dance”.  For the first time in a YEAR, I went to a club, and danced to RIHANNA! It was necessary for my mental well-being. Yes, it was a little expensive, but a girl needs a dose of the western world every once and a while. While planning a night out at Teso in Goa, I said “I don’t know which heels to wear” and my friend squealed laughing, “OMG, no one wears heels to Teso!” Noted Priyanka and Nami. The whole “Hippie in Heels” thing was getting very “Hippie Only” in Goa- so much so, that one night I found myself barefoot carrying my heels like I did only at 18.  I needed Singapore’s nightlife! I have shared some of the best places to get wasted on a backpacker’s budget . Most of the cool clubs and bars are mentioned on over on that post, but for those of you who would rather go BIG, here is my guide to a fabulous night out in Singapore (backpackers beware: this is super not on budget like my tagline implies)! Bars and Clubs of Singapore: A great place to start and have a laid-back dinner before partaking in the luxury nightlife of Singapore would be Robertson Quay or Clark Quay. It seemed pretty chill and there are a lot of restaurants and bars in that area to choose from most of which I mention in my budget post on Singapore’s nightlife where I list their daily specials. Some of the ones I included are Insomnia, Crazy Elephant, and China One where we had a lot of fun. Without specials, these are no longer budget options. One of the most famous clubs in Clarke Quay is Attica, also known as “sluttica” to locals. I’ve been told if you’re looking to get laid, this is the place to be! Men out there reading this are writing that down, I’m sure. at China One a bottle of vodka will set you back 200 bucks, but is cheaper than cover charges/drinks as a group If you want a more lavish dinner, go to one of the five star hotels in the Marina Bay or the Financial district . We didn’t eat here, we just had drinks. We went big… but not that big . Some of the best food will be at The Lantern at the top of the Fullerton Bay Hotel or Clifford at the bottom *it looked extra swanky*, Summer Pavilion, The Courtyard, New Asia Bar (which I’ll talk more about below), or Sky on 57 right on top on Marina Bay Sands. One of the oldest clubs in Singapore is Zouk . It wins countless awards for “Best Nightlife Experience” and is actually three interconnected clubs: Zouk (main dancefloor), Velvet Underground (house and soul), and Phuture (hip hop and R&amp;B). This is more of a younger scene that was recommended to be skipped because I guess I’m an old fart now. To mix it up you could try Kyo,  Cigar Bar for the guys  in China Town or Pangaea Wine Bar , which has loud music and is a little cliquey, but is ranked best of luxury nightlife in Singapore on many websites. I was surprised how many men were smoking giant cigars, but was not surprised that  everyone smoked cigarettes there. Now on to the Impressive Elegant Bars… If you only have a couple nights out in Singapore, you need to make time to see the laser show that comes from Marina Bay Sands. The best place to watch is across the bay at The Lantern in the Fullerton Bay Hotel, or another rooftop hotel on that side. View from the lantern, the perfect place to watch the laser show When the light show is over and you finish your 20-dollar drinks, you can walk across to Marina Bay Sands ( which houses Marina Bay Mall ) and go up to the rooftop (your ears will pop on the elevator and you’ll probably share it with some old rich Singaporean women leaving the hotel spa in robes). If you aren’t a hotel guest you can either pay a fee or hop on the elevator with someone who has a card. The rooftop bar is called KU DE TA  and is maybe the most well known bar in the world! The structure is “space ship” but looks like a boat going across 3 tall buildings. There is an infinity swimming pool on top that only guests have access to. This is a great view and a glass of wine is about 25-30 dollars.   okay just ignore my hair, I blame the mixture of wind &amp; humidity.  A couple other fancy-shmancy bars to check out are Avalon at Marina Bay and New Asia Bar in Swissotel The Stamford. The last Thursday of every month, the rooftop helipad is opened up for a party… but be careful- they don’t put up railings! That’s heli-scary. Get it? Hella scary, heli pad…"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-singapore/,singapore,"What makes Singapore a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Singapore is an incredibly, clean, polished city with high standards and impeccable taste! It’s a small country, so everything you must see is easy to get to. Singapore’s identity stems from a vast array of other cultures and expat communities, so there’s always something new to try, or somewhere new to explore.  What 5 star hotel is the best in Singapore? I’d have to say Marina Bay Sands , the hotel with the iconic infinity pool overlooking Singapore’s skyline. The hotel is right in the middle of Marina Bay, so you get amazing views of Singapore right from your room! It’s a great location; it’s in the center of the city, close to all of the action. Its right over a luxury mall with plenty of designer restaurants, so food and shopping is easily accessible! If you don’t feel like taking the lift down to the mall, Ce La Ve is a wonderful Asian Fusion restaurant at the top of Marina Bay Sands (MBS to the locals). What about boutique hotels in Singapore, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Raffles Hotel is an absolute beauty! It’s a Singapore icon, full of history and glamour! It’s right in the middle of the central business/civil district, so it’s easy to get nearly everywhere in Singapore. Better yet, the Long Bar, where the Singapore Sling cocktail was created, is right inside the hotel. Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Singapore? Sentosa Island is a great place to go for some adventure, from zip lining over beaches to indoor skydiving! Even better, when you’re done with your adventure, you can lounge around at a seaside pool (or by the ocean), fruity cocktail in hand, of course! You can also hire a yacht to take you out to St. John’s Island or out into the sea for a day of relaxing, partying, or sunbathing! MacRitchie Reservoir is fun to have a little hike around. There’s a treetop walk where you’re on these big metal bridges over the trees- it’s really beautiful, but avoid it if you’re afraid of heights! Where are the best hang outs during the day in Singapore? The Shangri-La Hotel has the most amazing tea buffet, with plenty of local Singaporean dishes and also the most incredible dessert spread- including a chocolate fountain! Haji Lane is another little place not to miss. It’s a “hipster” street right in the middle of the city, full of street art, small boutiques, and plenty of cafes. My favorite Haji Lane Café is #Selfie Coffee, where you take a selfie on their phone, and it’s printed onto the foam of your drink! If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Singapore and what are their best dishes? Singapore definitely takes pride in food, so you can’t really go wrong. A tried-and-true favorite of mine is Catalunya, right on the water of Marina Bay. They have the most incredible Spanish food and everything you can order there is absolutely fantastic. Another favorite is Stellar at One Altitude, a beautiful restaurant located at the top of the highest building in Singapore! Their streaks are absolutely amazing- perfectly cooked and oh so buttery! They melt in your mouth! And you get to enjoy that whilst enjoying the most incredible view of Singapore and the bay. Fancy restaurants in Singapore are amazing- but don’t skip out on the local food , which is a fusion of Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes, with influences from Thailand and Indonesia. Check out Hawker Centers for those ☺ Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Benjamin Browns on Orchard has insane over-the-top milkshakes! They’ve got tons of different flavors, and the toppings are crazy! There’s a slice of cake and a bunch of candy on top of one! The 2am Dessert Bar is also a great find. They have a bunch of different desserts, from cheesecake to more exotic tarts and mousses, and the best part? They’ve got a recommended wine/cocktail pairing! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Singapore; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  If you want to shop, Singapore is definitely the place! Orchard Road is the place to go, home of 22 malls, most of which are interconnected by underground walkways. You can find everything on Orchard; from big-name luxury goods to smaller local designers. I like Aijek, who designs some beautiful feminine clothing. It’s very lightweight (perfect for Singapore heat!) and very whimsical. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Singapore? The So Spa at the Sofitel on Sentosa Island is absolutely divine. Choose from a wide assortment of rejuvenating, relaxing, and health-inspired treatments, work out at their gym, then float in their waterfall pools- the pressure of the waterfall against your back releases tension! There are also a couple saunas and a body mud masque area! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Take a hike up to Mount Faber! It’s not a strenuous walk at all, and at the top, you’ll be rewarded with a beautiful Singapore sunset, peeping through the trees, the glow of the city lights below you. It’s the perfect balance of city and nature, and the sunset just ties it up into a big picture perfect moment. You can continue your walk all the way over to Sentosa! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. The Library Bar is a fantastic little place – if you can find it! You have to find the little bar first, then give them the day’s password for entry, found on their Facebook page. The hunt is surely worth it, though, as the second you walk into the quirky little bar, it’s like you’ve time traveled into a swinging little speakeasy! The cocktails are just as quirky as the concept of the bar; my favorite is the Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy, a pea and lemon gin cocktail! If you’re looking for a more low-key place to pregame, Stickies Bar is a good one! You can sing, play beer pong or cards, or watch a game there! Whatever you’d like to do whilst downing a beer, cider, or cocktail, you can surely do at Stickies! If you end the night at a fancy club in Singapore, which one do you head towards? Singapore does nightlife like no other! Clarke Quay is a covered area (so the rain can’t ruin your night), home to many bars and clubs. My favorites are Attica and F.Club! You could also head to Zouk, consistently voted one of the top clubs in the world! Make sure to end the night at Bang Bang, a club located at the Pan Pacific Hotel near Marina Bay. Bottle service is the way people like to go, but you can also buy drinks at the bars there."https://hippie-inheels.com/best-places-to-visit-in-slovenia/,slovenia,"10 Best Places to Visit in Slovenia Slovenia has both the Alps and the Adriatic sea but it’s small enough that you CAN see the best places to visit in Slovenia in just a one week holiday here in Slovenia. The best way to see all these places is to rent a car. To get in and out of Slovenia, look at not just Ljubljana airport but also Trieste, Italy. I use Kiwi.com to find the best rates for flight. The 10 Best Places to Visit in Slovenia 1. Piran Piran surprised me the most about Slovenia because, for me, I just didn’t picture the coast when I pictured Slovenia, but instead the Alpine region. Piran was like being in Croatia or Italy and had such an energetic vibe. It’s a very small town, and the coast of Slovenia is just 46 km long. I wrote about Piran in this article: Piran, Slovenia . 2. Ljubljana Quaint little Ljubljana. You don’t want to come to Slovenia and not spend time here! For a European capital city, it is surprisingly small, clean, green, and easy to get around. You can check all the tourist activities off your list in one day and then spend a couple of days exploring aimlessly down the pretty lanes. I wrote an article about how to spend 3 days in Ljubljana  and another about my favorite shops in Ljubljana . 3. Lake Bled Of course, Lake Bled is on this list! That’s most people’s primary reason for wanting to visit Lake Bled and it was definitely mine. It is a very small and beautiful lake with a church on an island in the middle and a castle towering above it. I was bummed that the rain didn’t let me have that perfect view, but it was still absolutely beautiful and fairytale-like. You can read about it here and find out where the treehouse is I slept in: Lake Bled in the Rain . 4. Lipica The Lipizzaner horses at Lipica Stud Farm are world-famous and beautiful. They have a gene which makes them turn from black to white at around age 4-5. They are the horses that “tip toe” around like they are dancing. I thought it was a fun and peaceful place to visit. For kids, it would be great because they have ponies, too. I wrote about my experiences here: Lipica Horse Stables . 5. Predjama Castle I have wanted to see this castle since FOREVER. It’s built into the cliffside and has been around since the Medieval times. It was smaller than I thought it would be and you need just an hour to get through it all with an audio guide. It is just 15 minutes from the caves mentioned next, Postojna caves. 6. Postojna Caves These caves are one of the top tourist attractions in the whole country. They were created by the Pivka River. You need just two hours maximum to go through this whole thing with an audio guide and have time for a coffee break. I wrote all about it in this article: Postojna Caves and Predjama Castle in Slovenia . 7. Logar Valley I loved driving through here even though it was pretty rainy so I didn’t take any photos (hence the photo of the dog, when we stopped for lunch. I was afraid to get my camera wet). It’s in the Alpine region and is a glacial valley. There are so many cool places to stay here and a lot of adventures like mountain biking and horseback riding. You can read more about it here . 8. Soča Valley A post shared by Madison Heller (@maddieheller14) on May 10, 2017 at 6:39am PDT The emerald-green river of Soca Valley is probably the most beautiful on this list (if I had seen it I’d agree)…. but I didn’t go here due to rain. We wanted to white water raft here but had to cancel our plans because the river was flowing too fast. We were told the views would be too misty and the river would be a muddy mess – making the views not worth the drive. Apparently, the trout from here is the best in the world! 9. Triglav National Park A post shared by Trails4Hiking (@diarionomade) on May 10, 2017 at 1:17am PDT I didn’t make time to visit Triglav National Park in the Julian Alps (Slovenia’s only National Park). I mean, it looks stunning! But, like Soca Valley, the weather was too bad and it didn’t seem worth the drive for mud and mist. The lake is called Lake Bohinj. The park is named after Mt. Triglav which is the highest peak in Slovenia. 10. Vogel A post shared by Tamara_photography (@tamaraphotography03) on Apr 24, 2017 at 4:23am PDT Vogel is another area I didn’t go to because it’s a winter town. It’s way high up in the Alpine region and the main reason to visit is to go to Vogel Ski Resort. You can read about things to do in Vogel here . There we have it, 10 of the best places to visit in Slovenia which you could fit into a week if you really had to – but two weeks is better."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-lake-bled/,slovenia,"What makes  Lake Bled  a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?   Lake Bled is known worldwide for its stunning beauty, but maybe not everybody knows that Slovenia is a leader in the wellness and thermal Spas field, as well as in hospitality, making of Lake Bled a mecca for people seeking for a 5 stars getaway.     What 5 star hotel is the best in Lake Bled?   My favorite hotel in Lake Bled is the Hotel Golf , which is actually a 4 star. The Hotel is absolutely gorgeous and has great service, but its greater feature is that it’s connected to the best Wellness in town, the Wellness Ziva, allowing you to access it directly from your room wearing nothing more than your robe! More on the Wellness coming .. :) Click here for rates and availability.    Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?   Lake Bled is full of activities to do in every season , one of the most romantic ones would be renting a rowing boat and row your princess around the lake as you were inside a fairytale! Renting a rowing boat is easy, and fun!     If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Lake Bled and what are their best dishes?   If you have a big date you should take her to dinner at the Bled’s castle. In it, there’s a very fancy Restaurant overlooking the lake. The view is absolutely amazing and they often perform live music and have much space for dancing. Again, she will fell exactly as a princess, so you should take her here if you’d like to ask some important question …. ;)   Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best?   Once in Bled you have to taste the Bled’s typical cake. It’s a very big block of cream and pastry, and it’s really really good. The best ones can be found at Slascicarna Smon, inside Bled’s village.     Time for a great sunset view… where would you go?   You would expect that the best sunset view would be on top of a hill overlooking the Lake and the mountains right? Well, probably it is so, but my favorite spot to enjoy the sunset is from the Wellness Ziva , which is one of my absolute favorite places i the entire world. The Wellness Ziva is part of the Hotel Golf, and while offering a wide range of pools and wellness services, its best feature according to me it’s the outdoors jacuzzi overlooking the Lake, the Castle and the Alps. Sunset from there is something magical, especially during winter, when outside it’s so cold, and you’re enjoying this magnificent view from inside a steaming bubbling jacuzzi!"https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-for-visiting-lake-bled-in-the-rain/,slovenia,"Tips for Visiting Lake Bled in the Rain &amp; How to Make the Most of it Ugh…. showing up at Lake Bled and not being able to see through the fog was not what I was hoping would happen! I’m going to share some tips for visiting Lake Bled in the rain. Lake Bled is this little lake with a church on an island in the middle and a castle behind it. It is probably on your Pinterest board! It was a dream place for me to visit and the number one reason I went to Slovenia. But, except for one day during my week in Slovenia, it rained. You can’t control the weather! So, obviously worse things can happen and a little rain isn’t a big deal, but it does mean you won’t be able to see that million dollar view you might have flown here specifically to see. I want to share what it was like being in Lake Bled in the rain, and some tips to make the most of it. Tips for Visting Lake Bled in the Rain &amp; Things You’ll want to know! 1. You won’t be able to go to the church if it’s a torrential downpour In the heavy rain, the small boats that take people to the church were not running, but I think this was mostly due to the fact no one was crazy enough to get in the boats in the rain! Brr. The church is only accessible through boats like this. BUT if it’s just raining a little bit, the boats are running. We saw people go out when it was raining fairly steady but light. 2. SUP seems off the table Standup paddle boarding here was my dream, but in the rain, there was no one offering the service while we were there. I imagine if you book ahead, you’ll have to see the policy on playing in the rain. 3. The castle is difficult to explore in the rain but there’s a reason to still go The castle that is perched on top of the hill, overlooking the lake, village, and church is one that you can explore the outside of mostly. You can go inside, but it’s not a huge castle tour like Predjama castle in Slovenia. But, when it rained as hard as it did while we were there, it was really too difficult to explore in even with an umbrella and even harder to take photos. see jacket here , see purse here see jumpsuit here , see long sweater here But, while it was difficult to get around, the cafe at the castle was very warm and cozy. It’s a great place to have coffee and offers that classic lake view we all want to see! 4. The best photos will be from above So, the lake shot you might want for Instagram: it’s going to be a little sub-par. In fact, I didn’t even get one good enough to post on my Instagram channel. The fog and the blurriness of the rain made it difficult for me plus I was afraid to get my camera wet. tips for visiting Lake Bled in the rain The photos from on the ground of the lake with the castle behind turned out okay, but the ones from above at the castle, looking down on the lake look better. You can see the fog clearly so it looks like a misty fairytale instead of just a rainy blurry day. 5. Cars drive fast and splash, take a taxi OR…. …hitchhike! Yes, Helen and I hitchhiked because we were tired of cars splashing us.  I think we drive pretty slow in Goa so Europe’s speeds of 100+km/hour seemed really fast to me. People drove through the little town of Lake Bled so quickly and all us tourists were getting splashed. It’s a tiny village and the walkway is right next to the road, like usual. So, after we walked in the rain to town to get some wine, we were like no way we are walking back again in this! Helen’s boots were soaked through and her toes were freezing. So, we put out our thumbs and the third car graciously stopped. Slovenians are really nice, so I feel like hitchhiking here has basically no risk ;) 6. Stay somewhere you can hear the rain while you sleep, it’s heaven! We stayed in a treehouse! It is called Garden Village Bled and it was an incredible place. Actually, I stayed in so many cool places, I’m going to write an article which is a round up of all the unique properties I found in Slovenia. In that article, I will go into more detail about Garden Village. In case you are wondering what is in my hand, it’s a tootsie roll. My mom sent it to me in India and I brought it to Slovenia. I always pack snacks! 7. Dress for the rain, duh! You know I didn’t, though, because when am I ever weather appropriate? I saw it would be 68 Fahrenheit (20 c) and thought hmm, that’s not cold, is it? I can wear a dress with a leather jacket.  I figured the sun would be out and the temperature would feel hotter than it said, after all, it was the end of April. see jacket here But, the rain brought the temperature down and my outfits were just not cut out for it. But, if you are traveling long-term chances are yours won’t be either. You will definitely need an umbrella and can buy them in the shops in town. 8. Be ready for when the sun does come out. Don’t be a homebody. It is still beautiful! Throughout the day there is bound to be a time when the rain slows and clouds move. Don’t just sit in your hotel! Go to town, chill at a cafe, go to some shops, and be out and about. If the rain does stop, it’s a very small town so you can head straight to the castle at that time or hop in a boat to the church. see sneakers here PS: the church does not have service on Sundays. Overall, just don’t let the rain ruin the whole town. Yes, it’s a bummer and I was disappointed to not see that epic view, but it was still absolutely stunning. You can walk up close to the lake and see how clear the water is and imagine what it must look like on a sunny day. So, these are my few tips for visiting Lake Bled in the rain. It’s not the worst thing to happen. Although it’s a small town, there are shops and cafes dotted around that you can hang out it. If you don’t want to risk it, come in July or August!"https://hippie-inheels.com/unique-places-to-stay-in-slovenia/,slovenia,"Most Unique Places to Stay in Slovenia I bopped around in Slovenia and stayed at a different hotel every night as I made my way around the country. On this trip, I worked with the Slovenia tourism board and part of our arrangement was that I could choose my lodgings and itinerary on the trip. I did SO much research before going so that I could find the coolest places to stay at. I found lots of unique places to stay in Slovenia and was grateful that the Slovenia tourism board booked me rooms there. On all “influencer” trips they will, of course, need to give you a hotel room to sleep in, and there is not rule that you have to promote that hotel. You do it only if you want to! So, there were some places that I went to that will not be on this list. You can be assured I am only including places that I really loved. Here are some seriously unique places to stay in Slovenia! 1. A Treehouse at Garden Village Bled I’m starting with my favorite, and because it’s my favorite, it will have the most information! Garden Village Bled is gold and I highly recommend splurging out to stay here a couple nights while you are in Lake Bled. You get to stay in a treehouse! Lake Bled is such a “fairytale” place that it’s perfect to stay up in a treehouse while here. You can click here to book . Rates are as low as $100 (right now while I’m typing this) but go up to around $250 at peak season. Location: Lake Bled. As you can see there is a loft upstairs, this photo shows what it looks like if you peek down from below. The next shot is the downstairs. The pool is all natural and there are even ducks floating around in it. The whole place is an eco-resort. The food was phenomenal! You’ll get a welcome drink and snack. We had dinner here and it was a 3-course meal (pre-selected), which I found very common in Slovenia at restaurants. The tables had grass growing on them! Sorry for the huge amount of photos. But, I really enjoyed this place. The staff was so kind, the food was delicious, and I have always wanted to stay in a treehouse. It’s a huge bonus that it’s also eco-friendly. 2. Raduha I adored this place! The design was spot on and the food was the best meal I had in Slovenia. The woman behind it all, Martina, has such an eye for design and did this all herself with all local wood and products like felt which is a huge industry here and sheep skins. They are kind of like treehouses, but not in the actual trees – so I guess huts on stilts? Raduha is in Luce, and would be if you decide to visit the mountain region, which you should! You can reach them at houseraduha@gmail.com or you can click here to book . Rooms are listed on their site at $200+ per night, but when booking last minute on booking.com I see a rate at just $78. Each room here is different and designed differently. There is a pool and spa. It’s in a very quaint little village. If you rent a car and drive through Slovenia (which is the best way to get around) then you should totally set this hotel into your itinerary – even if just for the food! They serve food that is basically foraged, fresh from the forest! It’s amazing. By the way, the beds here are the softest! 3. Kempinski Palace Portoroz The Kempinski is a 5-star hotel, so you might wonder what makes that unique and I don’t blame you. But, all Kempinski hotels are set up in buildings that have historic meaning, like this one. It is a palace! The restaurant here is called Sofia because Sofia Loren used to love to come here for late nights out. It’s so classy! You can either stay in the traditional side, or the “modern” side. I stayed in the traditional side, which I recommend (I saw the modern side). The rooms are all very large here and most have balconies that overlook the sea. The Kempinski is in Portoroz which is just the village next to Piran. You can walk to Piran if you want from Portoroz, that’s how small it is. Rooms are showing up now at around $180 for a night, which is about average for a Kempinski hotel. You can click here to book . The breakfast here is INCREDIBLE! I have never seen such a huge 5-star breakfast so give yourself time to eat here in the morning. The whole place has a “palace” vibe, because it IS an old palace – plus it’s the perfect location. 4. Vander Urbani I did not have a lot of time at Vander. It’s a member of Design Hotels and I think this was my favorite hotel other than the treehouse! I loved the simplistic style. I love staying at Design Hotels , although they are often smaller and have smaller rooms. Instead of offering space, they offer more in the details. Vander is in the heart of Ljubljana and has a perfect location. Rooms are online now for $190 per night. You can click here to book . There is a pool on the rooftop. According to a friend we met in Ljubljana, the restaurant at Vander is one of the most famous in town and offers a lunch deal of a 3-course meal for just 12 euros. We walked by one afternoon when we came back to Ljubljana and saw it packed to the brim. It’s a very popular place! 5. Hotel Slon Slon means elephant in Slovenian! Doesn’t this room look nice? Now would you be surprised if I told you it was a Best Western!? It is! I actually requested the tourism board to put me in a Best Western when I could have requested anywhere because this hotel is really cool and partly because when I was researching it I couldn’t believe it was Best Western, as the ones I stayed at in the USA did not look like this. The hotel is in the heart of the city making it a great location and it’s one of the most popular hotels in Ljubljana, along with Vander. But, if you found Vander too expensive then you might enjoy this hotel. Rooms here are at $120 right now. You can click here to book . The location is Ljubljana city center. It’s a 4-star hotel but it was so spacious, clean, and classy I would have thought it was 5-star. It’s really impressive and the rooms are cozy. I stayed here for two nights and was very comfortable! My room was massive. A few more unique places to stay in Slovenia… If I had more time in Ljubljana, I would look into Cubo Hotel and Hotel Nox. They are both top hotels in the city center. Hotel Cubo is in this massive historic building and is the priciest on this list at $260. It’s a 5-star hotel. Hotel Nox is a better deal at $130. It’s a boutique hotel with just 24 perfectly designed rooms. For those of you going up to the mountain region: If you are a family or you are looking for something more long-term with a kitchen you can check out Alpske Sanje  which is a whole house (and owner of the cute dog below). Other options would be apartments at Apartma Logarska . So there we go! These are some unique places to stay in Slovenia, based on weeks of my research before I went!"https://hippie-inheels.com/piran-slovenia/,slovenia,"Piran, Slovenia: Don’t Forget To Add The Coast To Your Slovenian Itinerary I loved the vibes in this small coastal town in Slovenia. I don’t have many tips to give but still wanted to tell you about this town because not only was it beautiful but Piran, Slovenia surprised me. I actually didn’t know there was a coast in Slovenia before I booked this trip. The coast is tiny (just 46 km long) but they sure do make the most of it.  Piran, Slovenia You can’t help but have your camera out at all times in Piran, at least I couldn’t. Everything was so photogenic. I was traveling with my friend, Helen, who is a photographer, and took loads as well.  I go to Europe every year but usually just Austria and London. Then, there was Finland and Latvia, but overall I don’t get many Europe vibes. So, to be here brought me back in time to Italy and Croatia years ago. It really did look similar and they even have signs in Italian! The food was delicious. Pasta with truffle, grilled sea bass, and tasty cakes! We never stopped eating. I didn’t see a lot of street food or pizza shops, though. It was mostly sit down restaurants and cafes.  There was a promenade with all the shops and cafes. It was really windy on one side of the peninsula, then really calm on the other. On the windy side, there were many people out kitesurfing.  jeans are abercrombie, see similar below Turn on your JavaScript to view content see bag here see similar dress here The pretty courtyard above and balcony below were from the Kempinski hotel where I stayed. Technically, it is in PortoRoz which is the village next to Piran. But, they are both such small “beach towns” you can just walk along the beach from one to the next.    see dress here, shop similar styles below Turn on your JavaScript to view content sees shoes here see jumpsuit here The sunset over the sea was gorgeous. We saw a nice couple having drinks with their adorable dog. Helen was deadset on going over to say hello, so we did. I’m usually not that brave to go up to strangers! But, they were so nice and so was their dog, Dexter. see jacket here shoes are james smith , see similar here I loved taking photos here and thought it was a cute town. I’m sorry I don’t have “tips” for you but really it’s so small, you don’t need them. Just wander around, look at how lovely the town is, and eat!"https://hippie-inheels.com/3-days-in-ljubljana-relaxed/,slovenia,"How To Spend 3 Days in Ljubljana &amp; Still See/Do Everything at a Relaxed Pace If there’s one thing I hate, it’s not having enough time in a city. But, I know often, people come to a country and want to bounce around, so 3 days in Ljubljana seems like a good starting point, especially because you have a lot more to see in Slovenia! I’m going to share the top tourist attractions and how you can see them at a really relaxed pace. If you wanted to you could actually see all the “tourist stuff” in just a day. It’s a very small city.  3 days in Ljubljana: stuff you need to know! I’m going to share transportation tips, the top tourist attractions, food you’ll want to try, some options on where to stay, and a section on shopping because there are a lot of cute shops here.  Getting In &amp; Out of Ljubljana The flights here are not aplenty, and it’s a small airport so it’s likely your route here will be obnoxious. It took me 30 hours from India! You can look into flying into Trieste, Italy as well, which is right at their border and since it’s Europe you can cross with ease, even in a rental car. There are local buses that take you from the airport to the city center.  The best way to travel Slovenia is a rental car, but I would wait until you are leaving Ljubljana to get the rental car. This is because you can walk everywhere in Ljubljana AND there are no cars allowed on the city center roads anymore. Lastly, parking is limited right now (they are set to build an underground parking lot soon). You’ll save money by renting a car the day you leave to see the rest of Slovenia. Pictured above is one of the little green cars they have in the city center that take people around since no cars are allowed. When your bus/taxi drops you off at the city center, you can ask your hotel to arrange this. It’s free but only runs until 8 pm!  Places to See in Ljubljana / Tourist Attractions in Ljubljana Everywhere you look here, you’ll see beauty. You could actually walk around the whole day and accidentally see everything there is to see in the city center area. I forgot one thing I love about European cities like this: they have a tourist information center! You can go and get maps and advice for free. I’ve been in Asia too long! Have a meal in the Ljubljana Castle in a tower I didn’t do a tour at the castle and just enjoyed it’s beauty from below until I went for dinner one night. I was a little castle’d out, as you’ll see a lot of castles in Slovenia! This one has cute cafes and restaurants inside and it’s FREE to enter. We ate at  Strelec restaurant . FYI before you go, it’s pricey. You get the cool experience of eating in a tower and the people who serve the meal are dressed up, the dishes are all bronze. It’s pretty cool. The meal is WAY fancy. Although you’d think this would be cool for children, it seems more like a fine dining adult experience.  my appetizer… I’d tell you what it is but no clue! Something like goose liver pate, something something To get up to the castle, you can take a cable car. It’s 4 Euro there and back for one ticket. But, it only goes until 9 pm so we missed our ride down and had to walk. We took a shortcut through the forest in the dark – but weren’t scared because every Slovenian we met had told us how safe Slovenia was lol  view from the cable car – worth it! Tivoli City Park I didn’t go to the park, but if you wanted to get a picnic and go it would be so nice. I drove past it and it did look beautiful. If you want to go here, it’s best to rent a bike which you can get at the tourist information center.  Visit the Market The market is every day except Sunday and they sell fruit/veg and local products. Of course, I was interested in the woven baskets. But, in Slovenia, you’ll see baskets, sheepskin, beeswax products (candle, soap, honey), pumpkin seed oil, and other items you might want to buy as souvenirs. There is also a part of the market inside which has meat, cheese, and nuts. Then the last part is a fish market which is also inside.  Open Kitchen (food market) on Fridays On Friday, there is a courtyard which is turned into a food market. Sadly, it rained the Friday I was there so I didn’t get to see this. Here, you can try all kinds of foods at once! Food markets are basically my dream come true. It’s only on from March-October when it’s warmer. “The choice of food on offer is wide and varied. Each Friday, the market features around thirty different food providers, including modern restaurants, traditional gostilnas, tourist farms, and independent chefs wanting to promote their offerings. The cooking is done to the accompaniment of music and entertainment.” -Slovenian tourism website Old Town: Triple Bridge / Lock Bridge “Butchers Bridge” / Dragon Bridge / Ljubljana Cathedral / Preseren Square: (Pink) Church of Annunciation So, Old Town you can’t miss, it’s right in the middle just beneath the castle! Ljubljana has a lot of famous bridges. Trip Bridge was the invention of  Jože Plečnik.  The lock bridge is where you put a lover’s lock on it like many cities have.  Pretty much all the must see things in Ljublana are right here in the “Old Town”. Just take some time to walk around and I highly recommend getting a map from information. You can see it all in an hour if you wanted. You can also take a walking tour to learn more about the history, which I did, and I won’t bore you with (although I found it interesting and LOVE walking tours in Europe). Plus, with a walking tour you can learn about why dragons are so important here and why they planted trees outside the main church (it’s a crazy reason!). Walk along the Ljubljanica river The river is usually emerald green, so I’m told. But, it was horrible and rainy most of my time in Slovenia so the river was churning up a lovely mud color. Still, beautiful. Along the river are these beautiful weeping willows just about a 10-minute walk down the riverside.  You can do SUP (stand up paddleboarding) and rent little boats to go on the river, but the river can’t be moving as fast as it was in these pictures.  Metelkova – the military barracks which are now a huge art scene! You can ride a bike here as well, it’s on the outside of town. This is an old military barracks that after years of negotiating, they decided to not tear it down and instead let it be a place for creativity. Here, you’ll find young people doing graffiti and other kinds of art, partying, and just chilling out. Apparently, it’s a cool place to go on a Friday night (the biggest night to go out in Ljubljana). I was in Ljubljana on a Friday night but I’m an old fart so didn’t go. Check it out in this article from the Guardian .  See the city from above If you go to the Skyscraper (yes, that’s the name or you can translate it: Neboticnik) you can have a coffee and cake and take in the best view in the city. It’s the tallest building and stands out, so you can’t miss it. The views were amazing and it’s a great cup of Joe! Architecture tours If you’re interested in architecture there are two things that would interest you. One is that there is a lot of Art Nouveau here and many tours for that. Also, Jože Plečnik did a lot of the buildings and bridges around town is really famous and you can do tours of his work. You can also learn about the Baroque style that is here. There is a lot of mishmash architecture going on, which makes it unique! Food in Ljubljana I was there as a guest of the tourism board, so they set me up on a private tour – but there are food tours online everywhere. I love trying new food when I travel but was not down with the beef tongue they love here (ick!). The sausages, though? Damn good! I wanted to bring some back to India, but my journey was way too long to keep them fresh.  The tastiest place to try sausages is above, Klobasarna. It makes such famous sausages that I kid you not, they have been to SPACE. An astronaut that went was Slovenian and apparently, each astronaut gets to take one food item, and she chose this sausage. NASA had to study it and make sure it was safe.  At all times, people in Slovenia want to drink: wine, beer, local spirits… they are down. Craft beer is a big thing here. Slovenian wine is amazing and they have a huge variety of local wines. The varieties of homemade liquor though were not my favorite, but then liquor never is. They had a blueberry one I was offered often and a honey flavor.  I don’t have a list of top restaurants as I didn’t really do my research on this one and kind of popped into places. But, one that I do want to make mention of is Druga Violina . It is a fantastic restaurant that employees people with special needs, through a program they run. The government is who they rent from, so they get a good deal on rent to keep the cost down. I love supporting places like this when I travel and bonus: the food was tasty! It’s local food so go for the special Slovenian potatoes (fried in yummy fat) and the dumplings.  Shopping in Ljubljana You know I have to find the cutest local shops, and I did! I wrote a whole post about this though, which you can read here: cute shops in Ljubljana . I also wrote in that article the types of souvenirs you might want to buy here.  The shops are adorable, as are the cafe’s and really that is the biggest reason to stay longer. Doors like that above just look so inviting, and as you walk around Ljubljana you’ll notice that every little shop looks just like this! How frustratingly charming ;) Where to stay in Ljubljana I stayed at two hotels here. One when I arrived, before I went exploring the rest of the country, and then another when I came back and actually spent time exploring Ljubljana. I go into a lot more detail about these hotels with a reviews, prices, and images in my article: unique places to stay in Slovenia . Vander – Design Hotel, Boutique, Trendy, Amazing restaurant, center of town Hotel Slon – Affordable, 4-star, Huge rooms, center of town   Stuff you can do for FREE in Ljubljana Many museums offer free entry on the first Sunday of each month Free events are almost always happening. You can check a calendar of them here .  Exploring nature at the Castle Hill walk, Tivoli Park, Roman Wall, and the Botanic gardens. WiFi is free in the city Exploring the markets and fairs (if you don’t buy anything) So, that’s about it for Ljubljana! There is a lot to do in 3 days here but as you can see, you could complete this pretty fast. You should definitely rent a bike and check out the park and military barracks on the outskirts of town. In the evenings (and anytime the sun comes out) the city really comes alive with every cafe fill to the brim, people having wine on the riverbanks, and guys playing music for cash near the bridges. It’s a very energetic city, no boring vibes here!"https://hippie-inheels.com/best-restaurants-in-pretoria/,south_africa,"The Best Restaurants in Pretoria, South Africa (markets, too!) Pretoria has been my home for the last 13 years. As someone who loves food, I’ve eaten a whole lot of meals around the city. Because sharing is caring, below is my top choices for delicious food and where the find the best restaurants in Pretoria, South Africa . Best Restaurants in Pretoria For Indian cuisine: Geet I love the fact that there are lots of Indian restaurants popping up everywhere in Pretoria! Geet remains my top choice for the best Indian cuisine. The restaurant is elegant, the food is phenomenal and the naan bread is to die for! Your meal starts with complimentary papadums and a trio of toppings. I always order a paneer dish, but the menu is endless so you’ll have plenty of choices. My favourite bread is the honey and coriander naan. For local cuisine: Karoo Café To get a taste of South African cuisine, head to Karoo Café. Try the ‘Skilpadjies’ or ‘Karoo Roosterkoek’ for breakfast. South Africans are big on red meat so if you want to taste something truly authentic, order the ‘Karoo Lamb Chops’, ‘Lamb potjie’ or the ‘Oxtail’. For dessert, I recommend the Rooibos Malva Pudding. It’s really sweet but so yummy! The ambience of this café is great! You’ll feel like you’re in the countryside on a farm and not in the middle of Pretoria. There’s a couple of Great Danes and other animals hanging around the café.  For delicious burgers: Burger Bistro Are you in the mood for a good old-fashioned burger and chips? Then head to Burger Bistro for the best burgers in town. The burgers are perfectly balanced and so delicious! Also, a Burger Bistro burger is so huge that it’s nearly impossible to hold it in one hand. Generous portions are always a plus for me! There are a few locations to choose from. If you are going in the middle of the day, finding an open table shouldn’t be a problem. However, if you go for dinner, arrive early to ensure you get a table. P.S. Vegetarians can order the Gandhi burger. You won’t see it on the menu but you can ask for it. For fine dining: La Pentola When it comes to fine dining, you are spoiled for choice in Pretoria. One of the best fine dining restaurants and my personal favourite is La Pentola. The food is so amazing that I had my wedding reception here. The menu is creative and unusual with loads of local delicacies like Crocodile, Warthog and Springbok. My husband always orders a fillet. You cannot go wrong with the Bourdalaise Fillet or the KWV Fillet.  For vegetarians, you’ll have plenty of dishes to choose from (very rare in Pretoria fine dining restaurants). My favourite is the Clockwork Orange – a buttery grilled halloumi steak topped with a delicious citrus sauce and almond flakes. Head to La Pentola for a romantic date, to celebrate a special occasion, or simply to enjoy the seriously good food. For the best pizza: Toni’s For the best pizza in Pretoria, go to Toni’s Fully Furnished Pizza Co. SERIOUSLY, the pizza is OUT OF THIS WORLD! A Toni pizza base is thin, light and crispy and topped with the best fresh ingredients.  Expect to see some unusual toppings on the menu. But don’t be alarmed, they go together like white on rice. My personal favourite is the ‘Cipolle’ – a tomato base topped with mozzarella, caramelised onion, brie and toasted almonds. For something ‘out there’ and very indulgent, try the ‘Salmone E Fragola’. Pizzas come in two sizes: a pizzette (15 cm) or a pizza (33 cm). You can even go half and half if you find it difficult to choose just one pizza (only available on the 33 cm base). For the health conscious, you can ask for a Banting or Gluten Free base. Toni’s also serves a delicious House Salad and great pasta dishes. For something different, try a dessert pizza. I highly recommended the ‘Hazelnut Dessert Pizza’. Be sure to make a reservation in advance if you want to enjoy the delicious food. For a night out with friends: Capital Craft Something that is definitely trending in Pretoria at the moment is craft beer. Nowadays every other bar or hangout is serving craft beers. The best place to enjoy a cold beer and tasty food is Capital Craft Beer Academy. Capital Craft has the biggest selection of beers I have ever seen! I’m not much of a beer drinker myself, but I really enjoyed the Hazelnut Ale (Red Stone Clarens Brewery). Another popular choice is the Soweto Gold Apple Ale (Ubuntu Kraal Brewery). Both are from local breweries and definitely worth a try. If beer isn’t your kind of thing, don’t worry. There are plenty of drinks to choose from and they even have Gin and Tonic on tap! When it comes to food, Capital Craft serves some of the best food in Pretoria. You can’t go wrong with a burger. The BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich also comes highly recommended. There are various platters to choose from if you want to share food with friends. Only in the mood for a snack? No problem. Order a side of fries or the Jalapeno Poppers. They are delicious! Always packed, it’s a great place to spend time with your friends. To ensure you get a table at Capital Craft, it’s best to make a reservation ahead of time. Markets   The best food in Pretoria isn’t limited to brick buildings. There are two fantastic markets that are definitely worth checking out. Hazel Food Market This outdoor market is a must for every foodie! Take a culinary trip around the world: spicy tacos from Mexico, crunchy churros from Spain, dolmades from Greece, steamed buns from Asia and of course delicious local cuisine. With my giant sweet tooth, my favourite is the Fudge stand! Here you’ll find fudge infused with chilly or cinnamon or Turkish delights to name a few! Come hungry and bring a lot of cash. Don’t miss the Hazel Food Market every Saturday from 08h00 to 14h00. Boeremark This market is for the early birds! The Boeremark is open every Saturday morning from 05h00 until 09h30. It’s the South African version of a farmer’s market. Here you’ll find fresh produce straight from the farm to your table. You can stock out on your groceries, but eat while you doing it! Grab a ‘moerkoffie’ and a couple of ‘pannekoeke’ (pancakes) as you browse the market. You also have to try ‘melkkos’! It’s South African comfort food you can eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It’s warm, it’s got cinnamon and sugar and it’s positively yummy!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-cape-town/,south_africa,"What makes Cape Town a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Cape Town is a perfect destination for the discerning traveler. European flair meets African sun here and so much natural beauty sometimes it’s hard to believe you are still in town. In addition, you will find some of the best restaurants and hotels of Africa in Cape Town and the surrounding Winelands. Capetonians are notoriously picky, so if they love their town, I am sure others will too. While you find a lot of luxury in the basic meaning of the word here, Cape Town’s luxuries go far beyond. There is just nothing better than a sunset viewed from the top of Table Mountain, nothing more exciting than rescuing a turtle on the drive to the West Coast National Park or simply seeing the amazing bluer than blue sky when you get up in the morning. What 5-star hotel is the best in Cape Town? Depending on what you like, I would recommend the One&amp;Only which is located directly at the V&amp;A Waterfront. It doesn’t get any chicer and more cosmopolitan and the marina view from the bar are unsurpassed. For a more traditional approach, I would recommend the Ellerman House . This super exclusive property is hidden away overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in Bantry Bay. It used to belong to Sir and Lady Ellerman and the setting will make you feel nothing less than royalty. Spa, pool, gardens and of course, a first-class wine cellar and their very own art gallery, add to its exclusive appeal. What about boutique hotels in Cape Town, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? I have lots of family here who rent rooms on Airbnb  (link to get $20 off first booking)  so I would probably send friends there first because all of them are so hospitable and beautiful. However, if someone wants to stay at a proper boutique hotel I would send them to La Grenadine . Here Parisian style meets a Cape Town backyard with the biggest pomegranate tree ever, right in the middle of town. For those who want to be close to the beach, I’d send them to the POD in Camps Bay. While I dislike Camps Bay for being too busy and touristy, the POD provides a little chic sanctuary in a side road. Close enough to walk down to Glen Beach, but secluded enough not to get caught up in the ‘strip’s’ craziness (unless you want to of course!). Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Cape Town? Welcome to adventure paradise! From sunset cruises on a sailing yacht, scuba diving, pop-up gourmet dinners, and paragliding off of Singal Hill anything is possible. A classic for tourists and locals alike is the moonlight hike up Lion’s Head during full moon. Do take a torch, though, because there are some steep parts to cover and moonlight will only get you so far. Another more relaxed favorite is a Sunday concert at Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. Local bands will come and play on its open-air stage and with the backdrop of Table Mountain the atmosphere becomes truly magical. A recent discovery of mine is snorkeling with the Cape Seals. These fun creatures get up close and personal with you and being in the water with them is an amazing experience. Just be warned – the water temperatures around Seal Island in the Atlantic are anything but mild and the stench surrounding the seals anything but pleasant. However, it wouldn’t be a real adventure without some troubles to overcome, would it? Where are the best hangouts during the day in Cape Town? Where not to hang out should be the question. I would start in town for some breakfast at Jason – croissant, coffee, people watching. From here head to Kloof Street for some shopping. On Saturdays, the Neighborgoods Market at the Old Biscuit Mill is still the place to be and a good place for further explorations in Woodstock. Stay here for lunch and if you get lucky even a meal at The Test Kitchen, undoubtedly Cape Town’s best restaurant. No day in Cape Town would be perfect without heading to the beach. I recommend Cozy Bay or Llandudno which will also provide stunning scenery on the way. Don’t forget the SPF, the South African sun is strong! However, that also provides the perfect opportunity to take a quick dip into the freezing Atlantic once you are properly warmed up. For non-beach goers – who are you anyhow?? – I recommend a stroll along the Sea Point Promenade and the Greenpoint Park, which offers a little greenery in the middle of town. From here soccer fans can take a peek at the Worldcup stadium and Italian coffee fiends go to Giovanni’s for their fix. End your day with sand in your hair, a smile on your face, and a cocktail at hand La Perla to watch the sunset. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Cape Town and what are their best dishes? Whether you already know the date will be a success or for a first date, I recommend an outdoors location. Cape Town gets chilly at night, even in summer, so perfect opportunity to snuggle up. One of my favorite date restaurants is Fork which offers modern tapas which are delicious and great for sharing. Try to get a table on the tiny balcony overlooking busy Long Street, perfect to get closer over a plate of pancetta wrapped prawns and fried goat cheese balls. And yes, of course, there are fairy lights! For foodie couples I recommend La Colombe in Constantia located in a romantic garden setting – however, know before who picks up the bill, it doesn’t come cheap. Also, you might be rather stuffed afterward so I wouldn’t count on too much post-date activity. For a more casual, even a first date, I’d go to Lucky Bao in Hout Bay. Asian gourmet fast food so the date can be quickly over if it needs to be, but can also be extended with a romantic sunset stroll on the beach if you want to. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? 95 Keerom makes some seriously amazing Italian food and has the best dessert in town: a duo of molten lava chocolate cakes, one dark, one white. The white one is a special treat – I love white chocolate and have to this day not seen it done anywhere else. Also, a really great dessert to share if you can pick sides. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Cape Town? Truth to be told, I was always a bit disappointed by SA fashion designers. While there is a local fashion week and such, I never thought it was even remotely intriguing. Then again I might be spoilt by years of living in New York. However, there are some really nice little boutiques that offer local designers. Head up and down Long Street for stores like Merchants on Long, mememe, and Mungo &amp; Jemima. There is even more great local talent when it comes to accessories and home decor. My favorites here are Katherine-Mary Pichulik for amazing necklaces, Chapel for handmade backpacks, and Skinny La Minx for home fabrics. Woodstock is the design hub of the city and offers a wide range of shops and design studios – perfect to lose some serious cash! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Cape Town? Hands down the best salon for facials, pedicures, and waxing is Petticoat Parlour – it’s funky, pretty and has exceptional beauticians. If you are in need of a massage and a piece of heaven there is no better place than Enmasse. Shiatsu and tea is what they do and I promise you, they do it well. On top of it, you will have a hard time finding a more serene place – imagine an aquarium had a love child with a cloud and you are pretty close to their aesthetics. Time for a great sunset view in Cape Town… where would you go? I don’t think you can do much better than Table Mountain for a perfect sunset view. However, I am terrified of cable cars and my knee is not in great shape right now eliminating the only options to get up there. Therefore, I would prefer the car option and drive up Signal Hill for similarly stunning vistas. My favorite though is a bit of an odd one. Drive from Camps Bay towards Hout Bay on Victoria Road – it is one of the most stunning coastal roads in the country. Drive here during sunset and you may understand why even after driving it countless times, I will still gasp and declare how beautiful the scene is every single time. There are also plenty of parking bays in case you want to turn it into a photo op. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. I like Publik which offers a great selection of unusual wines by the glass and is hipster cool yet unpretentious. For more of a beer garden vibe and an awesome burger head to neighboring Weinhaus + Biergarten (formerly &amp;Union), the godfather of South African craft beer. If you are keen to move seamlessly from dinner to cocktails to dancing, head to The Orphanage. Located on the corner of Orphan street they have some serious good mixologists at work and you can drink and do good at the same time. For every ‘Tea with the Vicar’ cocktail you buy, they donate a part of the proceeds to the orphanage that used to be located across the street."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/01/korea-travel-guide-seoul-itinerary/,south_korea,"KOREA ON A BUDGET: Seoul Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary Some countries change your life even before you set foot in it. One lazy day at the university, I was chillin’ with friends at the lobby of our college building when the College Secretary approached us. “I’m looking for volunteers,” she said. Apparently, exchange students from Korea had arrived way earlier than expected. She needed people who could tour them around the campus while they were preparing whatever it was they were preparing. Bored af, I was first to raise a hand. Many of these exchange students became good friends of mine. They were my first foreign friends.       At the time, my brother was coincidentally working at a factory near Seoul. The computer that I relied on in college was a product of his hard work there. ( Katas ng Korea , sabi nga nila.) This also means that every now and then, we would receive a package bursting with Korean products, which would then fill our living room racks and kitchen drawers. After graduation, my first job was with a Korean company that brought Korean students to the Philippines to learn English. So yes, my first boss, the first person who believed in my skills as a worker, was Korean. South Korea had already changed my life way before I set foot in it. So when I finally did, it felt wonderful. It felt like I was giving thanks. But yeah, the whole time, I was grateful. WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Seoul The political and economic center of South Korea, Seoul is home to almost 12 million residents. The larger Seoul Capital Area (Sudogwon), which includes neighboring Incheon and Gyeonggi-do, houses 25.6 million people (half of the country’s population), making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in the world, after Tokyo, Shanghai, and Jakarta. Like most capital cities in East Asia, Seoul is pulsating with curiosities. Think of it as a younger but more tamed Tokyo. Everywhere you go, there’s always something interesting to find even in a random neighborhood. A regular cafe (often located next to another cafe across another cafe) displays how many calories are in your order for the benefit of the weight health-conscious in you. If you’re feeling a bit offbeat, walk into a cat cafe to indulge the animal-lover in you or a toilet-themed one to satiate your appetite for humor. And that’s just the coffee shops! Seoul is also known for its obsession to beauty, something that became apparent as soon as I passed by half-dozen cosmetic shops after only two minutes of walking. (I LOVE IT. Here, I could step into a cosmetic store without anyone giving me judging stares.) But their constant quest for physical perfection isn’t limited to beauty products. Almost everything here looks pretty! Street food looks gourmet, university grounds are tourist spots, and historical sites are well-preserved! Language : Korean. English is getting increasingly common. Most signs have English translations. Currency : South Korean Won (KRW, ₩). KRW 1000 is roughly USD 0.85, EUR 0.8, PHP 42.62 (as of Jan 2017). Modes of payment : Many establishments accept credit cards, but most still prefer cash. Electricity Info : 220 volts. Plugs have two round pins. Left: Vins at Bukchon Hanok Village; Right: an animal playing around at teh Seoul TrickEye Museum in Hongdae. With a panda. How to Get to Seoul If you’re a Filipino citizen, you’ll need a visa. Here’s how to get a Korea visa . Seoul is served by two airports: Incheon International Airport (ICN) and Gimpo International Airport (GMP). Gimpo is used primarily for domestic and a few international flights (mostly from China, Japan, and Taiwan). Incheon, on the other hand, is used by most international flights. It is the largest and the primary gateway to South Korea. Gimpo is much closer, just 30 minutes away from Central Seoul, while Incheon is roughly an hour away by train or 1.5 hours by bus. If you’re coming from Southeast Asia, the cheapest flights to Incheon are offered by low-cost carriers. The lowest rates are often from Manila. AirAsia has the lowest year-round fares and they get even lower when there’s a promo. Here’s a quick search on SkyScanner. Manila to Incheon (Seoul) Kuala Lumpur to Incheon (Seoul) Where to Stay in Seoul Seoul has three major backpacking districts: Jongno, Myeongdong and Hongdae. Which is the best? Well, I hate answering with “It depends,” I would have to say “It depends.” Haha. All these areas are close to major tourist stops, so it will depend on which of these attractions you will visit. But here’s a quick summary. Myeongdong . Seoul’s main shopping district, dotted with boutiques and department stores. Close to Myeongdong Shopping Street and Namdaemun Market. If you love shopping, stay here. Check rates of Myeongdong hotels here. Hongdae-Sinchon . Seoul’s university belt. This place is driven by Seoul’s youth culture, nurturing a more romantic and underground atmosphere. Lots of creative and quirky shops and food places. Close to: Hongik University Street, Hongik Mural Street, and Ehwa Women’s University. If you’re a foodie, stay here. Check rates of Hongdae hotels here. Jongno . Seoul’s historic core. Its map is littered with shrines, temples, and other traditional sites. In fact, four of the city’s five grand palaces can be found in Jongno. It is also where the Bukchon Hanok Village, Gwangjang Market, and Insa-dong are located. If it’s your first time in Seoul, stay here . Check rates of Jongno hotels here. I have experienced staying in all three districts, and I personally prefer Jongno . There’s just so much to see and explore within walking distance.

Taxis will be much more expensive let’s not discuss that. Haha. The Fastest Option Image provided by Klook The Airport Railroad Express (AREX) EXPRESS Train. Emphasis on EXPRESS because there are two types (Express and ALL STOP, which I will discuss below. The Express Train usually costs ₩14,800, but I think discounted rates are still in effect, which is only ₩8000 for adults and ₩6900 for children. Travel time is 43 minutes. You can reserve a seat in advance with Klook! RESERVE HERE The Cheapest Option AREX ALL STOP Train. Will stop at all 12 stations before arriving at Seoul Station. It’s 15 minutes slower (travel time: 58 minutes), but costs only ₩4250. RESERVE HERE The Easiest Option By bus, if your hotel is close to one of the many bus stops scattered throughout the city. I say it’s easiest because there is no need to switch trains. I personally prefer this method because I despise transferring to another train line when I have 20+++ kilos of baggage on my back. The good news is, the three main backpacking districts in Seoul have their own bus stops! Here are the buses you need to catch: JONGNO : Bus 6002 (at Gate 5B or 12A). Get off at Jongno 1, 2, 3,4,5, or 6, whichever is closest to your hostel/hotel. Last bus: 11:30pm. Fare: ₩10,000. HONGDAE : Bus 6002 (at Gate 5B or 12A). Get off at Hongik University Station. Last bus: 11:30pm. Fare: ₩10,000. MYEONGDONG : Bus 6015 (at Gate 5B or 11B). Get off at Myeongdong Station. Last bus: 10:50pm. Fare: ₩15,000. If your hotel is closer to a subway station than the bus station, then take the train instead. Internet Connection in South Korea South Korea has the fastest internet connection in the world! Most establishments like fast food restaurants and cafes offer FREE wifi, too. But if you want to make sure you’re connected all the time, you can buy a 4G SIM Card or rent a Pocket Wifi. 4G LTE SIM Card! There are various pre-paid plans available depending on how long your stay is: 5 days, 10 days, 30 days. You can buy one in advance and just pick it up at Incheon Airport so you’re connected as soon as you land. RESERVE HERE Pocket Wifi Take advantage of Korea’s blazing internet speed! This pocket wifi will give you unlimited access anywhere in Korea. It can connect up to 3 devices at once. You can pick it up at Incheon Airport when you arrive. You will be charged per day. But if you reserve with Klook, you just need to pay for the first day and then settle the rest when you return the unit. RESERVE HERE How to Get Around Seoul You’ll find Seoul an extremely walkable city. Walk when you can. If you’re staying in Jongno, most historic attractions are within walking distance of each other. Otherwise, there’s always the subway, which makes Seoul-searching a walk in the park. Seoul’s expansive subway system is the third largest in the world. It consists of 14 lines criss-crossing underneath the vibrant city. It looks intimidating when you look at it, but it’s actually pretty easy to get the hang of. It uses cards that require a ₩500 deposit, which can be refunded after the ride. Before the trip, I encourage you to download a FREE app called Subway Korea . It is available for iOS and Android . Here’s how to use it. Open the app . You will be greeted by Seoul’s complicated subway map. Find your station of origin and tap it. It will reveal options. Choose Departs From . Find your destination station and tap it. Choose Arrives at . Choose between the route that will get you there fastest and the route that will make the fewest stops . It will then tell you the following: The estimated travel time (top of the screen) Number of stops (top of the screen) Fare (bottom, in green) The recommended route Here’s how to use Seoul’s subway system. Find a single journey traffic card ticket machine at the station. Select your destination. Select the number of tickets. Insert payment + refundable deposit of ₩500. Collect the single journey traffic card that will be released. After your ride, you can get the ₩500 deposit from one of the payment return machines at your destination. Each station stems into several routes that lead to exits that are far apart. Check the map displayed near the gates to make sure you’re taking the right exit. Often, signs leading to key tourist attractions are found around the station. Also, when walking inside train stations, keep right. There are prepaid cards available at every station, too. One of the most popular is the T-Money Card . It will save you ₩100 per ride, which isn’t much, but it’s convenient because you don’t need to get a ticket every single time. Another great thing about it is its coverage. You can use it on trains AND buses in many cities including Seoul and even Busan. Just make sure you load it with just enough credit so you don’t need to worry about getting a refund. Discover Seoul Pass If you have a pretty packed itinerary, you might want to consider purchasing a Discover Seoul Pass , which was created by the Seoul Tourism Organization specifically for foreign tourists. You can choose between the 24-hour pass and the 48-hour pass . Photo provided by Klook Here are some things that the Discover Seoul Pass can do for you: FREE access to 22 key attractions like the palaces and shrines, specialty museums like the TrickEye Museum in Hongdae, N Seoul Tower Observatory using only one card. Access to the Seoul City Double Decker Tour Bus Comes with T-Money (which I discussed above). But you need to top up before use. If you don’t use all credits, you can refund the remaining balance. Can be picked up at Incheon Airport at the time and date you specified Here are some of the tourist sites that are covered by the Discover Seoul Pass: N Seoul Tower (Observatory) MBC WORLD Trickeye &amp; Ice Museum HANBOKNAM Gyeongbokgung Palace Changdeokgung Palace Changgyeonggung Palace You can get the Discover Seoul Pass in advance with Klook!

This assumes the following: You are a group of two. You will be staying in a twin room at Fully Hong Hostel. You will be using a T-Money card (T-Card). Your meal allowance is limited to only ₩5000 for breakfast and ₩15000 for lunch and dinner. It’s actually too much for me considering that you will find a bowl of delicious bibimbap for only ₩5000. But I think it’s better to overestimate so let’s leave it at ₩15,000. I’m not a breakfast person, either. But fine, let’s still include breakfast for good measure. Just make necessary adjustments to match your needs.

You can still bring down the cost by staying in a dorm (and there are great options in the city), skipping the Trick Eye Museum (it’s not really unique to Seoul), or cutting down on your food budget (Please don’t. Korean food is awesome!) If you’re coming from Manila and you’re able to snag PHP7700 fare, the total cost of this trip is PHP 19,870 . For my first trip, I got my plane tickets from a SEAT SALE and paid only PHP 6000, hehe. Add the travel tax (which was being collected separately at the time) and the total is pretty much the same. Other Tips for the Poor Traveler Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung are the best palaces , but if you’re interested to explore more + Jongmyo Shrine, get an Integrated Palace Pass. If you buy individual tickets, the total will be at ₩14,000 but the palace pass is only ₩10,000. Walk when you can . Like I said, Seoul is very walkable and you’ll discover something along the way. In the itinerary above, I included the fare for the subway ride from Ewha University to Hongik University, but in reality I just walked. I also never used the subway to go around the Jongno area. Get a T-Card . It will save you ₩100 for every ride. But I said that already. If you’re on a really tight budget, you can skip restaurants altogether and just eat at Gwangjang Market (considerably cheaper) or munch on street food because they’re pretty tasty too. But if you can afford it, spend! For me, Korean cuisine is one of the best in the world! I’m salivating right now just typing this. (Sorry about the mental image.) Hahaha."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/01/budget-hotels-seoul-korea/,south_korea,"Seoul: Top 10 Budget Hotels Under $60 Here’s a list of the 10 best-rated hotels that offer rooms for as low as USD60 (PHP 3000) per night, according to TripAdvisor users (as of Jan 2017).

Like most of us, I learned about Nami Island when it was used as a setting for Winter Sonata , a Korean drama that became a phenomenal hit in many Asian countries, adding more fuel to the already unstoppable Korean wave that took the world by storm. But injecting another Korean dose to global pop culture wasn’t the only thing this romantic flick has done. It has also sparked interest in Nami Island as a major tourist destination, with the number of tourists skyrocketing from 270,000 in 2001 to over 650,000 in 2002 to over 3 million in 2014. But what is Nami Island really? Other than its lanes of metasequoia and ginkgo trees, what else awaits in this cinematic piece of paradise?         WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Understanding Nami Island How to Get to Nami Island from Seoul Where to Stay Near Nami Island Search for more: Seoul Hotels Top Hotels in Gapyeong (near Nami Island) Sample Itinerary and Expenses Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Understanding Nami Island Although part of Chuncheon’s territory, Nami Island or Namiseom is most easily accessible from a wharf in Gapyeong County, its main gateway and jump-off point. Before it became most famous as a Winter Sonata filming location, it is best known as the final resting place of General Nami, a controversial historical figure in the Joseon Dynasty. He rose to fame in the mid-1400s when he led a victorious campaign to crush a massive rebellion. At age 25, he was honored by King Sejo, who gave him a top position in the government. But when King Sejo died, his successor falsely accused him of being a traitor, which led to his and his family’s execution. It wasn’t until almost 400 years later when he was exonerated. Winter Sonata in Nami Island Walking around Nami Island Tomb of General Nami Nami Island covers an area of 430,000 square meters. This half-moon shaped island in the middle of the Han River was an almost barren patch of land with only a handful of chestnut trees. But when retired Bank of Korea governor Minn Byeong-do purchased the island in 1965, he reforested and transformed the island into the resort town that it is today. Over the past decades, it has hosted many events promoting art, culture, and environment-related causes. Because of its proximity to Seoul, Nami Island easily became a popular day tour destination.   How to Get to Nami Island from Seoul There are many ways to reach Nami Island, but these are the most popular options. Nami Island Ferry By Train Travel by train to Gapyeong Station. Walk or take a cab from the station to the ferry wharf. At the wharf, buy tickets to the island, which costs ₩8,000 for foreigners. By Bus Reserve a bus seat by emailing bus@naminara.com or calling +82-2-753-1247. Roundtrip fare is ₩15,000. Catch the shuttle bus in Insadong (near the West Gate of Tapgol Park) or Sungnyemun Square Bus Stop in front of Namdaemun Market. Bus leaves at 9:30am. This will take you to the wharf in Gapyeong. Board the ferry to Nami Island. Entrance Fee: ₩8,000 for foreigners.   Where to Stay Near Nami Island There are no hotels in the island itself. The closest is Gapyeong, where the Nami Island ferry picks up passengers. In my personal opinion, however, one day is enough to experience most of what Nami Island has to offer. Hence, if your main destination is Seoul, you might want to visit Namiseom on a day trip. Whatever your decision is, below are the top budget hotels in Seoul and Gapyeong.

To be quite frank, Seoul has it all! This city has incredible, state-of-the-art transportation systems as well as some of the most unique architecture on this side of the world. The food is great, the clubs and shopping are exquisite. What 5 star hotel is the best in Seoul? I think it’s a toss up between the Park Hyatt and the JW Marriot . Located on the upscale Teheran-ro, the Park Hyatt boasts modern rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows, three restaurants, a spa as well as an indoor pool so it would have to be my choice. On the weekends, the JW offers a wine concession in the basement of its facility, offering all-you-can-drink wine as well as finger foods. There’s a lounge area if you’d like to mingle with friends or a room with live music as well. What about boutique hotels in Seoul, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? There are some really cool and trendy hotels in addition to the upscale options mentioned above. The most well-known would be the Imperial Palace Boutique Hotel located in Seoul’s lively and cultural Itaewon neighborhood. The colorful, modern interior matches the one-of-a-kind interior which comes equipped with cozy bedding and a welcoming atmosphere. Another great option is Hotel April , which is reminiscent of a New York City loft. The brick features of this Gangnam hotel give off an urban vibe and its location can’t be beat. While these two options are wonderful, another popular choice of travelers are Air B&amp;B’s. Many of Seoul’s wealthiest will offer their homes for an extended stay, which is an opportunity people shouldn’t pass up! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Seoul? Travelers can cruise along the Hangang River at night or visit a number of top-notch spas throughout the country. Koreans love spa treatments and it’s something that is part of the country’s culture. There are a number of 24-hour spas, also known as jimjilbangs, located in Seoul. One of my favorite spas is located a short walking distance from my apartment in Sinsa-dong. Spa Lei is a women’s-only 24-hour spa that offers anything from mineral baths (think chrysanthemum, mugwort, rose and kelp pools) to manicure serves and even massages. It’s a cultural experience unique to Korea as you’re doing most of these activities completely naked. I don’t think it gets more personal or adventurous than that! Where are the best hang outs during the day in Seoul? I really love to have picnics by the river in the summer or take trips out to some of the smaller islands close to Seoul. Seoul is filled with quirky cafes and restaurants if that’s more your style, though. There are cute cafes tucked away in every neighborhood, but my favorite ‘hoods would have to be Itaewon, Hongdae and Sangsu. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Seoul and what are their best dishes? I really like Bamboo House for more upscale Korean fare. Located in the heart of Gangnam, Bamboo House offers quality Korean beef in a sophisticated and cozy environment. The multi-course menu offers an array of options from Korean pancakes to more traditional dishes such as jap-chae (glass noodles pan fried with vegetables.) If you’re interested in an upscale Korean barbecue experience, be sure to check this place out! Address: 658-10 Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul Subway Line: Yeoksam Station (Line 2) Exit 7 Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? My personal favorite is Han’s Bakery. I am legitimately obsessed with a specialty cheesecake they make. If I’m being completely honest, I was never a fan of cheesecake for the first 25 years of my life until I tried Hans’ version and now I’m hooked. The price tag for a small cake is a bit steep at $40, but it’s totally worth it – I promise. I’ve been lucky to live by both of Hans’ locations. There’s one in Suji-gu, a suburb outside of Seoul as well as in Sinsa-dong, where I’m currently located. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Seoul? One of my favorite local designers at the moment is New Kidz Nohant. The clothing style is certainly very Korean (think slightly conservative, extremely comfortable and sensible) but is totally universal. My favorite project by the design team is the Hangeul   Fashion Project. The design team paired up with the famous Korean actor Yoo Ah In to create unique t-shirts like this one. Seeing as I’ve lived in Korea for the past two years of my life, I really love the combination of English and the Korean alphabet and I love the sleek style. I have a t-shirt as well as a bag. The great news about supporting this brand is that Yoo Ah In donates all of the proceeds to the Beautiful Foundation, a non-profit that supports the wellbeing of underprivileged Korean youth. There are plenty of local boutique shops located throughout Seoul. I highly recommend peruising through Sinsa-dong’s Garosu-gil street as well as skimming the shops in the nearby Apgujeong neighborhood. If you’d like a more comprehensive list of suggestions, check out this link! Time for a great sunset view in Seoul… where would you go? I highly recommend watching the sunset from N. Seoul Tower. I don’t think there’s a better view of the city, if I’m honest. One of my favorite activities is climbing the stairs to the top, walking around for a bit and heading down just before sunset. The views of the city on the way down are stunning and you get a nice workout in, too! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. I really like the cocktails at a place called The Beastro. Located in Seoul’s trendy Hongdae neighborhood, The Beastro is also close to a variety of clubs where locals party until the sun comes up. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Octagon, one of the most talked about clubs in Seoul is a popular spot to dance the weekday blues away. The bottle service option is always a must as the tables are situated in an open space above the dance floor, providing space away from the crowd but still gaining access to the bumping atmosphere."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-seville/,spain," What makes Seville a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Seville is simply a gorgeous, gorgeous city. It is the perfect mix of the relaxed, laid-back Spanish lifestyle, combined with boutique experiences and treats. If you want to have a beautiful time in Seville, there are so many places to go and indulge in some beautiful Spanish dancing, delicious drinks and food, or some really fun activities. What 5 star hotel is the best in Seville? I would say that Hotel Alfonso XIII is hands down the most stunning hotel in Seville. It is right in the centre of the city, boasts a gorgeous, palatial building, and is just incredibly relaxing, even if you’re just going for a drink or a meal. Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in Seville, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? I would recommend either the Melia , Alfonso (of course!), or the Alcoba hotel , which offers a slightly cheaper alternative but is still a 4 star hotel! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Seville? In Seville it’s fairly straightforward to hire a canoe and go canoeing along the main river. There are also some tennis courts near Plaza de Cuba, and near the bull ring you can hire bikes and go cycling around the city. Another favourite is to buy tickets to a Flamenco evening. Tickets include a meal and drinks, and are a fabulous way to spend an evening with family and friends. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Seville? There is a park a bit further along from the Plaza de Cuba which is tranquil and quite far from the bustle of the city. I would say it’s one of the best places to go for a picnic, or to read a book. Aside from that, you can also go to the famous Parque Maria Luisa, which is right in the middle of the city and filled with beautiful places to sit and relax. During the summer, there are often festivals held in the park, which means plenty of street food and games! La Una de Delicias, near Puerta de Jerez, is also a really nice restaurant to go to for lunch or an early dinner. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Seville and what are their best dishes? There is a really good Mexican restaurant called Las Iguanas Ranas, right near the cathedral. L’oca Guiliva is also a really good Italian restaurant in one of the central parts of town. If you’re looking for an authentic Spanish experience, however, Los Coloniales is one of the oldest and most sought after tapas bars in Seville! You can also head to the beautiful and luxurious Rio Grande: right by the river next to the Plaza de Cuba, this place is a must see for delicious dining and unforgettable views! Let’s talk desserts in Seville- what place makes the best? There’s an ice cream place in Alfalfa that has the best, most creamiest ice cream in Seville. There are plenty of places you can go to get desserts and ice cream in the centre, but this one is the best! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Seville? Seville is generally quite good for shopping. The main shopping area is not very far away from Las Cetas, (a mushroom-like structure in the very heart of the city), and area surrounding the football stadium is filled with designer stores. Unfortunately, many of the Seville-based designers specialise in making plates and tiles, so you may not be able to find many locally made clothing, but there are a range of very good designer brands along the main streets. Seville is also very good for boutique, artisanal jewellery. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Seville? I would say that the best spa in Seville would have to be Aire de Sevilla. It is absolutely stunning, extremely relaxing, and just the perfect place to plan a mini-retreat. Another option would be the H20 Spa Balnearios, which is right next to the Plaza de Espana (you could even get a horse and carriage ride there if you wanted), and has a very Moroccan feel to it! Time for a great sunset view in Seville… where would you go? Now this one is quite special. It’s a Sevillian tradition to buy a bottle of wine and head for a riverside walk, and you will often find people siting by the river drinking in the early evening. That’s where I would go. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. I was once taken on a date to this gorgeous bar just by the river, at water level. It’s on the Calle Betis, just after the Plaza De Cuba, and it offers a really intimate, romantic atmosphere. Not many people know about it either, so you’re always left in peace! If you don’t want something quite as datey, Fabiola is a good flamenco bar and Groucho is really good for pre-drinks and has a very strong family atmosphere! If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? I would say the best ones to go to all-year round are Bhudda, Tokyo, or Antique Theatro, which is huge but very fun! It’s usually best to go to Tokyo on Tuesdays and Alfalfa, Seville’s prime drinking area, on Thursdays, as that’s where everyone goes to party. In the summer, Babilonia is also a really fun outdoor club to head to, they hire dancers to dance on the podiums and the atmosphere is always incredible!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-barcelona/,spain,"What makes Barcelona a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Barcelona has everything. It’s a city full of amazing places to discover, Gaudí buildings, shopping, nights out, fancy restaurants, cocktail bars and on the seaside enjoying the breeze, can you ask for more? Check out all Barcelona tours here What 5-star hotel is the best in Barcelona? My recommendation would be the Palace .  It is an incredible hotel, right in the city center with a classical style, I love their lounge and the rooms are just fab with the last technology but with their own style that reminds me of lords and ladies time.  They have my favorite afternoon tea in town and their spa Mayan Luxury is from another world. It’s won for three consecutive years the world spa luxury awards. Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in Barcelona, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Hotel Mercer is right in the gothic quarter and only a 10-minute walk from Las Ramblas. The boutique hotel is set in an ancient building next to the Roman walls in a special location. Their rooms are stylish and chic and they expose the brick walls. I love their orange garden, and it is also a good place to do your afternoon tea or drink something even if you don’t stay. Check out all luxury hotels in Barcelona here Are there any fun activities in Barcelona for the adventurous traveler? If you want a more exclusive experience I’d recommend sleeping for a night in a yacht in Barcelona’s harbor. The Southern Cross, a Scottish yacht restored with 5 cabins on it is right in the Barceloneta. If you book an apartment, you can get a chef for you that will cook and set your table with the menu you desire. With all comfort of being at home but taking the restaurant delicatessen with you, there is nothing to worry about. Be served and enjoy! Joan Gurgui is your home delivery chef! Where are the best hang outs during the day in Barcelona? If you are looking for a cafeteria, I would go to The Cosmos in the city center or Usagi for tea and Japanese treats and cakes.  Cup and cake and their shops are also a good choice, they have salty and sweet treats for all tastes and they became the trendy place to meet in the afternoon with friends.  In the center, I like Hotel Pulitzer , very comfy sofas in their lounge and good tea, I am a tea lover! You have a big date. What are the most delicious restaurants in Barcelona and what are their best dishes? My top choice is Kyoto Japanese restaurant, the best sushi in town and they have butterfish makis, my favorite ones.  If you like Thai food, the Thai gardens is the perfect place for a romantic dinner, my choices to order would be the coconut sauce chicken and the green curry with shrimps. If you share, go for the entrées, they are very good to start with the dinner. For Catalan food, more typical, my pick is Nou Ramonet in La Barceloneta area. Order fish or rice; they are gorgeous. Check out food tours in Barcelona here Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best desserts in Barcelona? As weird as it might sound, there is a restaurant that only serves desserts, all their menu is about desserts. It is called Espai Sucre, and if you like them this is your paradise.  Escribà bakery in Las Ramblas is also a good place for desserts, my favorite a vanilla cake with the shape of red lips, it is incredible! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Barcelona; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Go to the Gothic, it is plenty of local designers to choose from, my favorite Ivori. Gràcia is a good place too if you are looking for artisans and designers. My favorite brand is Singular and Antonieta. Check all the shopping tours in Barcelona here What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Barcelona? If you want to go for a mani pedi, the Pink Peony is the most famous place in town.   If you want to enjoy a spa afternoon, the Mandarin Oriental and the Mayan Luxury Spa in El Palace Hotel are great choices. Silom spa is also one of my favorites, mid-range prices. Time for a great sunset view in Barcelona… where would you go? At the beach, I would recommend El Chiringuito del Escribà, right next to the sand and the sea. The W Barcelona Hotel  is also a good choice to meet up and have a cocktail on their terrace overlooking the sea and good views of the sunset. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks. You can find the best cocktails in town in Milano. It is a cocktail bar famous for its live jazz performances. My pick is their daiquiris with fresh fruit. The mango one is delicious! The Kahiki, a Hawaiian cocktail bar in Plaça Universitat is a classic, good place for coconut cocktails. If you end the night at a fancy club in Barcelona, which one do you head towards? I would go for Shoko. It’s a restaurant-discotheque in the seaside. There are plenty of restaurants and clubs in the area. However, this one is very fancy so be aware of smart dress code."https://hippie-inheels.com/tour-of-andalucia-spain-6-must-visit-cities/,spain,"Tour of Andalucia Spain: 6 Must Visit Cities in Andalucia Spain The southern province of Andalucia in Spain has its own distinct and beautiful culture. It’s also full of rolling mountains, valleys, beautiful coastline, and national parks. It’s a must visit if you head to Spain ! This post will share how to have the perfect tour of Andalucia at your own pace. You could spend your whole trip getting to know this vibrant region. It’s full of historic cities, charming villages, and beautiful nature. I spent almost a month visiting this region, so I want to tell you all about the best cities to visit in Andalucia Spain! Tour of Andalucia Spain: 6 Cities to Visit in Andalucia Spain 1. Granada The first city on the list is Granada Spain – this was absolutely my favorite spot in Spain, and one of my new favorite cities in the world! Granada is a very old city – the area around the city has been populated since 5500 B.C.. The Moors ruled this city for centuries, and their influence can be seen everywhere – in the architecture, food, etc. Another very interesting thing about Granada is its geography. It’s located at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains – the tallest mountains in all of Europe. Yet it’s only an hour drive from the coast. This means you have access to tropical coastline and snow covered mountains for skiing all within an hour or two’s distance. There are lots of amazing natural places to explore if you’re interested in  hiking Sierra Nevada mountains and outdoor sports like mountain biking and skiing are plentiful. The biggest attraction in Granada is the beautiful Alhambra, or the old Moorish castle and palace. Be sure to buy your tickets ahead of time as they can often sell out. Granada also has a very fun tradition of serving free tapas with every drink order! This makes it super easy to eat your way slowly around this foodie city. I highly recommend delving into the food culture here with a Granada food tour , or just a self guided tapas tour! Granada has endless pretty corners to explore, winding cobblestone streets, and beautiful doors. You can spend hours just taking pictures. Be sure to visit the Alhambra, see a flamenco show, wander the picturesque neighborhood of the Albaicin, and visit the many pretty churches and historic buildings. If you’re wondering what to do in Granada , there is so much! Be sure to give yourself a few days here. 2. Seville Seville is a gorgeous and regal city. It’s also the largest city in Andalucia. While Granada feels a bit bohemian and artsy, Seville is classy and polished. In the centro area, every building looks freshly painted in pretty soft pastels. The architecture is impressive, and the city is jam packed with great shopping and restaurants. The crown jewel of Seville is the Alcazar – or the historic castle and palace. Every city in this region has one, but the one in Seville was the most dramatic and beautiful. The tile, the courtyards, and gardens were astounding. I could have taken pictures here for days! Be sure to make a visit here a priority. There are lots of other beautiful historic buildings to visit like the Iglesia Colegial del Divino Salvador, and the dramatic cathedral. Be sure to also climb up the Torre Giralda on the side of the Cathedral. You’ll get a great 360 view of the city below. The city of Seville is divided by the river Guadalquivir that runs right through it. This is a beautiful area to walk along and enjoy the river views. The Torre de Oro is also on the edge of the river, and offers a beautiful view from the top. Seville has an amazing food scene. Be sure to visit the pretty Triana area, and the hip Feria neighborhoods to enjoy the delicious food and drink of Seville. 3. Malaga Malaga surprised me. I knew it was a popular resort area for British tourists, but didn’t realize it also had such a charming and beautiful city center. I spent 2 days here, but could have definitely stayed longer. The food here also blew me away! Just as the other cities, Malaga has their historic castle/fortress to visit – the Alcazaba. This castle is situated on a hill and has sweeping views of the city and the Mediterranean below. There isn’t quite as much tile or colorful details as the castles in Granada or Seville, but it is still absolutely worth a visit. Spend some time wandering through these beautiful grounds. Be sure to visit the Picasso museum here. Picasso was from Malaga, and this museum is full of his beautiful works. It’s also just fun to wander around the narrow cobblestone streets, gaze up at the colorful buildings, and get lost in the charming centro.  Don’t forget to visit the impressive Cathedral, and take a look at the old Roman Amphitheater. And do your share of eating. The food scene here is thriving and every meal we had far exceeded our expectations. A few great places to try are Cortijo de Pepe for lunch, or El Meson de Cervantes or El Tapeo de Cervantes for dinner. 4. Cadiz Cadiz is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Spain! It’s also one of the oldest in all of Western Europe. This city is isolated on a peninsula in the southern part of Spain. Since it was a perfect place for a port in between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, it’s been an important city for trade. The downtown Centro is full of historic buildings like the giant cathedral, the Plaza San Juan de Dios, the San Francisco church and convent, and many plazas. Another interesting thing about the city, is that it is full of watchtowers that were used as look out points to keep the city secure. There are still more than 100 towers scattered through the city, but the most famous is the Torre Tavira. You can climb to the top of this tower and get sweeping views of the picturesque city. There is also a museum here that will tell you about the history of the city and the towers. The Torre also houses a camera obscura that uses pinhole camera principles to show you a live view of the city. The camera obscura tour is included in admission. Be sure to also visit the Castillo de San Sebastian that is only connected to the mainland by a bridge. The nearby beach of La Playa de la Caleta is surprisingly pretty for a city beach and worth a stroll or swim. Cadiz is also known for their delicious seafood, so be sure to stop for some tapas de mariscos. 5. Ronda Ronda is most well known for the dramatic cliff that it sits on. The river, Guadelevin that runs through the city has carved very steep sheer cliffs and a canyon that runs through the middle of the city. This makes for very picturesque views from below or above. You can walk along the southwestern edge of the centro and find lookout points to see views of the valley below. Then walk over the new bridge to the oldest part of the city. You can take a pathway on the western side that leads down below the bridge. This is a great place to take a selfie with the giant and impressive bridge and canyon. If you then walk back up and circle around to the other side of the centro, you will see the smaller old bridge – still impressive and interesting to see. The old centro is full of pretty old architecture and cute tapas bars to stop for a glass of wine and some olives. If you’re interested in the Spanish tradition of bull fighting, stop by the Plaza de Toros to see the world famous bull ring. You can also take a tour inside. 6. Olvera The final city on my list is not a well known one – it’s the little town of Olvera, one of the pueblos blancos, or white towns in the Andalucia region. Really, I just think it’s important to spend a little time in a small town in this area to balance out the experience in the big cities. Small town life is very different, and allows you to see authentic Spanish lifestyle – mostly untouched by tourism. You can stop by any of the pueblos blancos, but I think Olvera is the most beautiful and most interesting of all. Olvera sits at the top of a mountain with gorgeous views of the mountains, valleys, and olive farms below. The top of the town is marked by a small Moorish castle that dates from the 12th century. A few steps from the castle is a Spanish church built in the 1800’s. Below these monuments are the steep sloping old centro streets – winding cobblestones, and historic white buildings. Besides the historic features of the town, Olvera sits right on the Via Verde route – an old railroad path that has been converted to a bike or walking route. It’s a beautiful place to enjoy the natural scenery. If you are short on time, you could just visit Olvera for a day or even an afternoon. But if you have enough time, it’s great to stay for a couple days, absorbing the slow pace of life, having a drink with locals at a tapas bar, and being greeted on the street. And to top it off Olvera has some of the best sunsets I’ve seen of anywhere in the world. And that’s it! 6 cities you should definitely see if you head to the Andalucia region of Spain."https://hippie-inheels.com/visiting-valencia/,spain,"Visiting Valencia When booking a place to stay while visiting Valencia, you should decide if you want to stay in “Old Town” or near the beach , as the city scene is not integrated into the beach life. I was unaware when I booked and ended up in Old Town, paying quite a lot overall in bus tickets to the beach during the day (where I really wanted to be). out shopping, not happy on bus going the wrong direction.. whoops Where I stayed Overall, Valencia is easy to travel cheaply so if bus tickets at around 1.50 euro aren’t a concern of yours then pick whichever hostel suites you best, regardless of location.I stayed at  ABCyou B&amp;B , which has very mixed reviews online. I thought it was great. I had a private room, scrumptious all you can eat free breakfast, fan, tv, mac computer, balcony, comfy duvet, coffee in the room, and very clean attached bathroom. We bought a market pizza and tried to cook it in the kitchen, but there was no oven. The owner took the pizza home, and cooked it at his house. How kind! He came back with a hot pizza and complimentary bottled water. He mapped the city out for us with tips on where to go. Click here to book a room in Valencia Tip: Sometimes staying somewhere with decent, but not great ratings, is good because they work a bit harder to get higher reviews.  The beach was beautiful! After being in hot Spanish cities, nothing could have been more refreshing. Sunburnt and tired from playing in the waves we headed back. Casco Antiguo Touring Old Town through Casco Antiguo is an adventure on it’s own. The food market had stall after stall of hanging meats. I’d be grossed out if they weren’t so good. I ate ham every day in Spain! We spent the majority of the time hanging out in the main square or silk and central markets, but did see the Central Post office , Chapel of the Holy Grail , Plaza de la Reina , Serranos Towers and half a day at the Oceanogrific (aquarium) . The building of the aquarium on it’s own is beautiful sculpture that resembles a whale (or dolphin?) and it’s surrounded by cold blue water… that you can’t get in. So cruel on a hot day! There was a dinosaur museum as well. Upon returning to our hostel, the owner informed us he’d accidently over booked and we’d have to leave. He booked us online a room three times the price of his at the Red Nest Hostel. He even tried to give us cab fare to get there. We were sad to leave, as the bed was so comfortable but we had no choice in the matter. Red Nest was mediocre. Other options in Valencia tours to the hot springs (out of budget) renting scooters (we thought we’d wreck) tapas tour and the free walking tour (we did these on our own) For a nice night out, try Radio City in the middle of downtown, although we didn’t find Valencia to be much of a party scene like Barcelona’s raging nightlife . It was very old fashioned and full of culture. For us, it was a nice place to enjoy the beach and relax."https://hippie-inheels.com/backpacking-madrid/,spain,"Tips on Backpacking Madrid While in Spain, it’s very worthwhile to spend time in the capital, Madrid. For me, Spain was on the high end of my budget. I flew from Ireland to Spain and on to Greece before I headed north in my Eastern Europe backpacking trip. Spain was a luxurious extra that I could barely afford. Travel like a local in Madrid I chose to  Couchsurf  most of the cities I stayed in, including Madrid. I couldn’t have chosen better; my hosts were three boys my age that had the weekend of work and plenty of time to show me around. Thanks to them, I got to experience the cities’ food, nightlife, and attractions like a local-  is there any better way to travel?  Make sure to  stay safe while couchsurfing . Luckily enough, the boys had a car so we were saved not only lodging, but local transport as well. Much of the first two days were spent seeing buildings. This has to be my least favorite thing about exploring a new city. I am not as appreciative of architecture as some, and I find myself bored, hoping that at least I’m getting a tan or losing a few pounds while I walk. Attractions not to miss in Madrid We saw the Cathedral of Madrid and the Royal Palace . Everywhere you walk, it seems you come across another massive cathedral or palace. The city is full of little ponds with statues and fountains. Each moment you’ll want to capture in photo! Attractions to add to your list: Palacio Real, Palacio de Santa Cruz, Iglesia de San Jose, and Palacio de Velazquez. If you don’t have a host to show you around, join one of the free city walking tours. Spend some time wandering through the Royal Botanical Garden and Retiro Park to wander around, have a picnic, and see the ponds and sculpted artistry in the hedges. The gardens are amazing throughout Madrid. Even the train station has a greenhouse inside. Real Madrid Futbol (soccer) is a huge part of life in Madrid. Bernabeu Stadium is world famous because of the soccer club Real Madrid, boasting players like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo . it’s a rule that anytime D.B. is mentioned you have to add a shirtless photo (right?) If you want to see a game, check out their website for schedule and plan your trip between the months September through April .  You can see them train at Valdebebas Friday at 1030 for 2 euros if you can’t get a ticket to the game, which I’m told is just as good! Make sure to get there early, and depending on management it isn’t always open. Bull fighting! In Madrid, traditional bull fighting is still happening at Plaza de Toros de las Ventas , which means the Matador kills the bull at the end of the two hour show. Is PETA freaking out somewhere? I was! I chose not to see a show like this; although I’m told May and June are the best times to go for San Izidro festival . The boys I stayed with are originally from Pamplona, where the “running of the bulls” takes place every year. They said it’s “dumb and dangerous” They never take part in the actual running, just the festivities. Other happenings in Madrid: There are museums to visit as well as cooking and flamenco dance classes to take- a good reason for me to plan a return trip. We cooked at home mostly. Lots of pasta, bread, and salads with oil, vinegar, and sea salt that for some reason tasted better than any salad I’ve made at home. I learned the tip to making a perfect grilled cheese. First of all use nicer bread and Gouda cheese, and don’t spread the butter. Just put a glob in the middle of each side and let it melt out. Genius.   The nightlife is almost as good as Barcelona ! My encounters with men there were actually quite annoying. I found the men I was meeting to be far too forward as well as invading my personal space. Hopefully that’s just bad luck and not a indicator of the Madrid men. My hosts were respectful, kind, and friendly. Madrid is a modern city and in the summer was very hot to walk around. I found it to be equal parts historical and fun. Tip on Spain travel : compare eurail plan prices and buses. Although I usually use Eurail, for my verison of the trip, it saved me money to travel by bus through Spain. It was comfortable and inexpensive."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/04/hbo-game-thrones-filming-locations-tourist-spots/,spain,"15 Game of Thrones Filming Locations that You Can Visit It’s that time of the year again! You know that another Game of Thrones season has begun when your Facebook news feed is flooded with cheers of excitement, cries of anger, and death threats for friends who are posting spoilers. It is not difficult to understand why HBO’s highly entertaining and often wildly brutal adaptation of the George RR Martin novels has reached the legendary status in pop culture. It has all the right ingredients: compelling characters, convincing production, unpredictable plot twists, and the right amount of fantasy. And dragons! Put it all together and you get a weekly serving of wonder. Brutal at times, but still pretty mindblowing. But there’s one more thing that always captivates me about this phenomenal hit. On the Season 6 premiere, for instance, when the khalasar made their way to Khal Jhaqo with Daenerys Targaryen in tow, I was so drawn to the arid landscape that surrounded them that I googled it right away. Bardenas Reales in Spain, it turned out. I have been so fascinated with GoT’s choices of filming locations that I have come up with a mission: visit as many of them as I can. The first that I set foot on was Essaouira in Morocco, which was where all Astapor scenes were shot (including that part where Khaleesi freed the Unsullied and ordered them to kill their masters). And when I backpack across Europe later this year, I’m certainly making stops in Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Spain.       So I decided to make a list of the fictional places in the series and their real-life counterparts, where they were primarily filmed. But before we begin, some notes: This list covers exterior shots only. Many of the interior sequences were actually done elsewhere. For example, Dobrovnik’s streets and coastal walls are used mainly for King’s Landing, but interior shots (Red Keep, Iron Throne, etc.) are done in sets in Northern Ireland. This is not 1:1. King’s Landing may be filmed mainly in Dubrovnik, but they also took supplementary footage of Essaouira and Malta as the Westeros capital. Dubrovnik also stood in for the City of Qarth in Season 2. Many of these sites have been digitally modified or enhanced by the show. Winterfell, for example, is almost unrecognizable as Castle Ward. This is not complete. I will update this as the series moves forward. Now that we got the caveats out of the way, here it is: a Game of Thrones fan’s travel bucket list! WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland 9. Pentos: Malta 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. King’s Landing: Dubrovnik, Croatia The ancient port city of Dubrovnik has seen a steady increase in tourism since they first used it to depict King’s Landing in Season 1. Executive Producer David Benioff said, “The first time we saw Dubrovnik, I was in shock, because the whole city really looked the way we pictured King’s Landing looking.” 2. Winterfell: Castle Ward, Northern Ireland Castle Ward tower digitally modified to create Winterfell The vast 1000-acre grounds surrounding Castle Ward has hosted the production team as they bring to life many of the series’ key moments, including scenes featuring Winterfell, seat of the House Stark and capital of the North. Much of the first 2 seasons took advantage of the sheer size of its grassy farmyard, perfect for army camp sequences, and ancient structures including Audley’s Castle. 3. The Wall and Castle Black: Magheramorne Quarry, Northern Ireland The Magheramorne Quarry is an abandoned limestone quarry in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is where the Castle Black set was installed. (It has also been used as Hardhome and the city walls of King’s Landing in Season 2’s Blackwater episode.) It is currently not accessible to the public, but there are pending plans of reopening it as a mountain biking center. Fingers crossed. 4. Beyond the Wall: Iceland Iceland as Wildling and White Walker territory Iceland in real life Most of the events north of the Wall of Westeros are realized in Iceland. This includes the glacier at Snæfellsjökull (I don’t even know how to pronounce that properly) which was used as the Fist of the First Men; Mývatn Lake, a frozen lava lake close to the town of Akureyri, which was where Mance Rayder’s wildling group dwelled; and Grjótagjá Cave, where Jon Snow and Ygritte had a very wet consummation of their love. 5. Dorne: Seville and Guadalajara, Spain Alcázar of Seville as Sunspear in Dorne Alcázar of Seville in reality Dorne was actually what I was so excited to see on television. I just thought it had the most character. Dorne, the southernmost region of the Seven Kingdoms, in the books was actually inspired by medieval Spain, so it totally makes sense that they chose Seville as location, including Sunspear, seat of House Martell, which was actually the Alcázar of Seville in reality. This season, fans are also excited to see the Tower of Joy, which was said to be Castillo de Zafra, a 12th-century castle in Guadalajara. 6. Iron Islands: Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland Also known as “raised beach,” Ballintoy Harbor in County Antrim can take pride in being real-life Iron Islands. Images of this picturesque harbor were digitally enhanced to mimic the jaw-dropping seascape of Pyke and Lordsport. You remember that scene where Theon Greyjoy first meets his sister Yara? That was shot here. 7. Dragonstone Island: Downhill Strand, Northern Ireland Stannis Baratheon’s bailiwick is actually Downhill Strand, a beach destination in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It’s where Stannis and Melisandre set the Seven idols on fire and where Davos allowed Gendry to flee. 8. Kingsroad: the Dark Hedges of Armoy, Northern Ireland Kingsroad Do you remember when Arya, Yoren, Gendry, and Hot Pie were on the way to the Wall after escaping King’s Landing? Did you notice the beautiful avenue flanked with rows of eerie but beautiful trees? That’s the Dark Hedges of Armoy, which in the GoT world is Kingsroad. It is actually a road of beech trees, which according to Northern Ireland’s tourism website , were planted in the 18th century by the Stuart family “to impress visitors as they approached the entrance to their Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.” 9. Pentos: Malta See that arch in the background? That’s the Azure Window, a famous feature of the Maltese Island of Gozo. Azure Window IRL. And now we go all the way back to Season 1. The Mediterranean archipelago of Malta has been home to the GoT team for many days, too, mostly during the filming of Pentos. In particular, the 16th century Verdala Palace, the official summer residence of the Maltese President, stood in for the mansion of Illyrio Mopatis, the merchant-prince who sold Daenerys to Khal Drogo in marriage. The wedding feast then took place in Gozo Island, the second largest island in Malta. 10. Meereen: Split, Croatia Meereen, the largest city that Daenerys Targaryen has conquered and ruled so far, is the Croatian city of Split in real life. Situated on the coast of Dalmatia, this picturesque city faces the Adriatic Sea. Among the sites used in the series is the Diocletian’s Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site, whose cellars provided replacement for the underground passages in Meereen. 11. Braavos: Šibenik, Croatia Šibenik, a quiet medieval town in Central Dalmatia, Croatia, made its GoT debut in Season 5 as the free city of Braavos, where Arya Stark found herself after sailing from Westeros and where the Iron Bank is located. 12. Astapor: Essaouira, Morocco Essaouira as Astapor Essaouira in real life The port city of Essaouira along the Atlantic coast of Morocco serves as Astapor, one of the cities in Slaver’s Bay. Essaouira is where most scenes in Astapor was shot, including the unforgettable and iconic scene wherein Daenerys Targaryen bought and freed the Unsullied, and then ordered her dragons to attack. Dracarys! 13. Yunkai: Aït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco Aït-Ben-Haddou as Yunkai Aït-Ben-Haddou IRL. Also in Morocco is the old city of Aït-Ben-Haddou, a fortified city on the edge of the great Sahara desert. It’s no stranger to movies as it has been the setting for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), and Prince of Persia (2010) among others. But in the GoT world, Aït-Ben-Haddou is Yunkai, aka Yellow City and one of the three great city-states in Slaver’s Bay. 14. Vaes Dothrak: Almeria in Andalusia, Spain Vaes Dothrak has yet to be featured, but rumor has it that the team tapped the exotic charms of Almeria, a city in Andalusia, Spain, for this. We’ll see in the coming episodes. 15. Dothraki Sea: Bardenas Reales, Spain Many places have been used to depict the many parts of Dothraki Sea, but in the Season 6 premiere, the place we casually refer to as “wherever the fuck Drogon dropped Daenerys” is Bardenas Reales, the 100,000-acre badlands in southeast Navarre, Spain. "https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,spain,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://hippie-inheels.com/little-guide-to-unawatuna/,sri_lanka,"Your Little Guide to Unawatuna: Surf, SUP, Snorkel! This wasn’t our first time to Unawatuna. We already knew it was a paradise beach in Sri Lanka. Last time we were there, I really didn’t have time to explore much so I wanted to amend that this time and give you guys a little guide to Unawatuna. There are so many adventure activities in Unawatuna and we wanted to try them all. Getting to Unawatuna Flight from Bombay to Colombo are  very  cheap so this is a great trip to take from India. In fact, if you’re traveling India I suggest tying in Sri Lanka to your trip. The bummer is that taxis from the airport in Colombo to Galle (the area that Unawatuna is in) are very expensive. The government taxis quoted 9,000 Sri Lankan Rs ($62) and the tour companies on display were about the same. A man in the crowd offered us a rate of 7,500 which was a steal. We actually called him again to take us back to the airport when our trip was over. Here’s his information in case you want to reach out:  Malsha Tours  +94 77 821 7630 . You can alternatively take a rickshaw, bus, or taxi to the Colombo Fort train station and take a train to Unawatuna (but you’ll get stuck in Colombo traffic). It’ll take at least 4 hours. Another option is taking a bus from the airport to Colombo bus station to switch to another bus which goes to Galle. From Galle you can hire a car to Unawatuna. That’ll take up to 6 hours. We opted for the taxi directly there to save time. It was 2 hours. There are also car rental options at the airport if you think you’ll be driving a lot. For getting around Unawatuna, we found a really nice young rickshaw driver who gave fair rates and was super funny. Here’s his contact: Manoj Tours, +94 77 523 8071. Planning Your Trip to Unawatuna / Where to Stay in Unawatuna I had about a week to plan for this trip but limited time so went onto TripAdvisor to check the top things to do and places to stay. The first step in trip planning is to figure out what hotel you’ll be at. Then your area will be more pinpointed to start seeing where you can eat, party, and play! Once you have the hotel, things start to fall into place. I explained in this post  how I use TripAdvisor to find my perfect hotel. I came to the conclusion that Cantaloupe Aqua was best hotel in Unawatuna for us to stay at. A lot of my reasoning was based on location and photos. There is a surf reef just in front of the hotel AND an infinity pool. It was #12 of hotels in Unawatuna, but once I filtered out my amenities it was the #1 choice (pool, spa, restaurant, A/C, on the beach, free breakfast &amp; WiFi). Use filters when you search! I have the app so that I can easily look things up once I am there too. Now that you can book through TripAdvisor, which is a new feature, your planning takes no time at all ( download app for Andriod or iPhone ).  Contact: Cantaloupe Aqua ,  Matara Road, Habaraduwa | Talpe , Unawatuna, Galle GL 80630, Sri Lanka, +94 91 7 200500 The hotel was perfect for us and ended up being one of Ben’s favorite hotels of all time, as he says. I loved hearing the waves at night and waking up early to catch sun and read. Its nice to not have to even walk to the beach but just be there already. While waiting for your lunch, you can just plop in the pool. Since we only had 4 days, it was worth splurging out. What to See in Unawatuna When I looked up what to do in Unawatuna I already knew some activities I wanted to try. I usually try to do at least 10 things! I saw the top three were the Japanese Peace Pagoda, Jungle Beach, and Unawatuna Beach. It just so lucked out that the tour company I chose (I’ll explain that later on) went to all these places  while doing the other tours , so I was basically checking two things off at once. We chanced a pass by the Japanese Peach Pagoda by boat on our way to go snorkeling! The second thing on the list was Jungle beach which we were going to for the snorkeling trip so we got to check that off the list too. This actually wasn’t my first time to Jungle Beach. It was interesting to find out that they may be shutting down the shack and the Government might take it all over. You can also check out turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka as there are many doing conservation work here. Make sure to research for a good one, though! There were more things to see like Unawatuna Beach which is at #3. Luckily, the same tour company I mentioned about above was based from Unawatuna beach! We were getting really lucky here. Another popular thing, maybe the MOST popular thing to do in Galle (Unawatuna) is to go to Galle Fort which was built by the Dutch and see the old Dutch church. We meandered there after a long adventurous beach day with the same tour company. Adventure in Unawatuna When it comes to what to do in an area, the simplest way to search is on the TripAdvisor app. Just type “Unawatuna” into location and then you can choose from “what to do” or restaurants, hotels, or whatever you are looking for. Once you start scrolling through the things to do, in this case past the beaches and tourist sites, you’ll see the tours and adventure. You can then click on each one to see the multiple companies offering the tours. We knew for sure we wanted to SUP, surf, snorkel, and go fishing. Under each of those I kept seeing a company called Darshana Tours. It was too good of luck that his company did all the tours, so an easy choice to use them. It ended up being even better, because as I mentioned about they passed by the Japanese Pagoda on the way to snorkeling and did the snorkeling at Jungle Beach, so it was like three things at once. We didn’t have much time but honestly you can do A LOT in 4 days here. Darshana’s shop is right on Unawatuna beach. When we got there in the morning, the first thing we did was go play on the Stand Up Paddle boards. After that was done, we got on Darshana’s boat and went to Jungle Beach for a snorkel session which was the main attraction for the day. The boat has a glass bottom and we passed by a shipwreck so that was a really cool added bonus. We had planned on surfing that evening but the weather was a little weird. There had been a storm the afternoon before, there were no waves, but a really strong current. We ended up going fishing at sunset instead. To be honest, it was a bit unsuccessful. My dad would have been ashamed after all the family fishing trips we took! The current was really strong and seriously we couldn’t tell if we had a bit or just the waves were strong. We fished with calamari. No catches, but it was the perfect place to see sunset… The next day it was up bright and early for the thing we were most excited about: surfing! The waves were perfect so I can’t really blame anyone but myself for not doing very well. I was attempting to do it on my own rather than being pushed, which is a first for me. It wasn’t going well. We were only there for half and hour and both just starting to get a hang of it again (I only finished a wave once) when Ben got hurt. I saw him walking out of the water and it looked like he was waving to me. Darshana went out too. I thought there was a rip so I started to swim in to. It was actually because when Ben wiped out the fin of the board cut a deep gash into his elbow. Pretty sure there was some bone showing.We went to the Government hospital instead of the big one in Galle which would have cost a fortune. It ended up being only $10 because Darshana pretending he was paying and we later paid him back. Perks of having a tour guide! Plus, we never would have found this place. It seemed to be about 4-5 km away and the path was only wide enough for a rickshaw. The doctor stitched Ben up, but we were done with our adventures after that!"https://hippie-inheels.com/ultimate-guide-to-stockholm/,sweden,"Ultimate Guide to Stockholm: Experience the city like a local Budget tips for Stockholm Stockholm is known to be quite expensive, and don’t get me wrong – it is! However, there are ways to experience Stockholm without breaking the bank. Here are some budget tips on how to experience Stockholm. 1. Free walking tours in Stockholm Stockholm offers free walking tours! The tour will show you around Gamla Stan (the old city), and you’ll get a lot of context and history about the different areas. They also offer tours around the more modern areas, and each tour last for about one hour. You can find more information at Free Tour Stockholm . 2. Island hopping pass The archipelago is really beautiful and definitely worth to be seen, and luckily, you can do it on the cheap. Depending on what island you visit, tickets are 50 to 150 SEK ($8–23), and it you really want to explore the island, you can get the 5-day travelcard (also called the Island Hopping pass) for 445 SEK. Check out Waxholmsbolaget  for the most affordable tickets. 3. Water fo’ free Refill your water bottle! Instead of spending money on buying water, drink tap water. Sweden has some of the best tap water in the world – take full advantage! Getting in and out of Stockholm Arlanda is the best option for flying to and from Stockholm. It’s easy to get to and from central with Arlanda express only taking 20 minutes to Stockholm central. A cheaper option is the train. It leaves from SkyCity (located between terminal 4 and 5) and takes you straight into Stockholm in around 40 minutes, and if you want a more comfortable option cabs are easy to find! If you’re flying with a budget airline like  Ryanair, you will most likely fly into Skavsta Airport. It’s located south of Stockholm, and from there you take a bus into central. It will take you around 80 minutes and one adult ticket costs 139SEK. Transportation in Stockholm Transportation can be a bit tricky when you get to a new city, but the best way to get around Stockholm is by using the subway. You’ll have to buy a re-loadable card and fill it up, find Pressbyrån (located in pretty much any subway station) and they will help you out. You can’t pay in cash on buses or on the subway, so make sure to sort out tickets, and taxi isn’t the cheapest way to travel. A good idea is to download the SL app to your phone, there you can register your card and buy single tickets, find routes, and get information. If you’re in Stockholm over a weekend, during Friday and Saturday night, the trains run all night! 9 of the Yummiest Places to eat in Stockholm Stockholm is filled with great restaurants and bars, but it’s not the cheapest city to spend a night out. If you just want to get something quick, pizza, kebab, and outdoor grills, cost between 55-80 SEK. But if you want to go to a nicer restaurant it’s a bit more pricey, it will probably cost you between 150-300 SEK for a sit-down dinner with food and drinks. Lunch is a bit cheaper, around 80-120 SEK. If you just want to go out for a beer it will cost you around 65 SEK. 1.  Greasy Spoon Here you’ll find traditional English brunch, and even though the waitor might not be fully British, they do speak English. 2.  Pom &amp; Flora Pom &amp;Flora is one of the most popular brunch places in Stockholm, it offers delicious food for good prices, and it’s very Instagram friendly. 3.  Mälarpaviljongen Perfect in the summer, usually opens in the beginning of April and offers good food (although a tad pricy), different events, and a beautiful location just by the water. 4.  58 Dim Sum Here you can get 10 dumplings for only 58 SEK, a very good price in Stockholm so if you have a dumpling craving, this is the place to go! 5.  Le Rouge  This place is perfect if you’re looking for something a bit different, especially if you’re out with friends and want a drink after. Le Rouge has a Moulin Rouge inspired decor, as you could probably tell from the name, and is a restaurant/bar depending on which area you choose. 6.  Urban Deli During weekdays Urban Deli serve cheap and delicious brunch, expect to pay around 100 SEK ($12) and get a lot of options. 7.  Flippin Burgers One of my favorite burger places in Stockholm, it’s not too expensive and their milkshakes are a must try! 8.  Papà Fancy Italian food? Who doesn´t! Italiano Papá is located at Östermalm and it’s a great place to spend an evening with friends. The restaurant has a very young vibe, the waiters are really friendly, it’s good prices, and the food is great. 9.  Ramen Ki Mama Probably some of the best Ramen you’ll find in Stockholm! And if you want the ultimate Swedish experience, why not head out to one of the IKEA stores and have yourself some meatballs! When in Sweden, you can’t forget to “fika” (have coffee). It’s as Swedish as you’ll get. You’ll be able to find cozy coffee shop pretty much at every corner, but if you find yourself at Mariatorget, Kaffe , is a good option, serving good coffee for good prices. Louie Louie can also be found on Södermalm and has more of a hipster vibe. They serve delicious vegan sandwiches and good coffee! If you’re walking around Gamla Stan simply take your pick, it’s filled with cozy places to drink coffee! Tourist Mode: Things to do and see in Stockholm Tourist Card If you know you’re gonna explore Stockholm during a few days, it might be a good idea to purchase the Stockholm Card . This pass gives you free entry to 75 attractions, up to 14 free sightseeing tours, a number of discounts and a free guidebook. It also gives you discounts in several restaurants and shops. Read more about it  here . Ulriksdahls Slott If you feel like leaving the city center for an afternoon, exploring the Royal National Park in Solna is one of my favorite things to do on a sunny day. Here you’ll find a Roay Palace, and the beautiful park is a great idea for a day trip. There’s also a café in the area serving a vegetarian buffet for 155 SEK that I’ve eaten over and over again. See the city from above Ericsson Globe offers a fantastic sky view from about 130 meters (425 feet) above sea level. If you have the Stockholm Card you can take the ride for free. The SkyView gondolas departs every 10 minutes and takes you to the top of the world’s largest spherical building. Read more  here . Skansen , Gröna Lund, and the ABBA museum Skansen Zoo is the perfect day trip if you’re travelling with kids, but even if not, petting cute animals is never wrong, right? Skansen is located just by Gröna Lund, so when (or if) you get tired of cuddling cute animals, it’s easy to head out to Gröna Lund and enjoy some rides in this theme park. Gröna Lund also offers a lot of great concerts during the summer, and the entrance is very price worthy! In this area you’ll also find the ABBA museum, and if you’re a fan of this pop sensation (or of music in general) this will definitely be a cool place to visit. The entry fee is 195 SEK for an adult ticket, 65 SEK for children 7-15. Edvard Andersson växthus Having a slight obsession with greens and plants, and a dream of turning my apartment into a minor jungle, Edvart Anderssons Green House is a dream to walk around it. It’s such a beautiful place and full of inspiration! Fotografiska If you’re interested in photography Fotografiska always offers interesting and inspiring exhibitions, it’s located just by Slussen, giving you a great view of the water and Gröna Lund on the other side. It also has a nice restaurant on the top floor. If you want a more relaxing evening, Centralbadet and Sturebadet are nice options. Sturebadet offers gym, spa, and a swimming pool for you to enjoy, they also have a restaurant if you get hungry. It’s a tad pricey but could be a nice way to treat yourself! Centralbadet is located on Drottninggatan and is quite similar, offering spa, swimming pool, and gym, and is very cozy! The Best Shopping in Stockholm Head to T-Centralen (subway stop) and walk up and down Drottninggatan, it gets busy on weekends so keep that in mind. Here you’ll find more shop than you’ll ever need, everything from H&amp;M to Top Shop, to candy stores, and cinemas. Hötorget is just around the corner if you’re in the mood for a market feel (although a very small market), but here you’ll find cheap flowers and some bits and bobs. If you want to shop in a more quiet setting, Götgatan on Södermalm is a great alternative to Drottninggatan. Here you’ll find a lot of the same shops, although not as many or as busy as on Drottningatan. But there’s also more bars and cozy cafés here. If it’s a mall you’re looking for, head to Mall of Scandinavia in Solna, as the name implies – it’s the biggest shopping mall in Scandinavia. Here you’ll also find an IMAX if you’re interested in seeing a movie, plenty of restaurants (my all time favorite is BIM, or if you’re in the mood for tapas, Caliente is delicious!), and of course loads of shops! If it’s second-hand shops you’re looking for, try Saker&amp;Ting  (a really tiny store but with some interesting options),  Old Touch ,  Pop Boutique , or  Beyond Retro . Nightlife in Stockholm: Drinks and dancing Stockholm has a pretty vibrant nightlife, it’s not vibrant like Barcelona where there are people out during all hours, dancing and eating. Honestly, you probably won’t see a lot of people just walking around during the night, and restaurants close pretty early. But if you want to get your dance on, Stockholm has a lot to offer. Berns is located in central Stockholm and a very popular destination, Ambassadeur is another good option, especially if you’re between 18 and 25. A lot of clubs in Stockholm have an entrance fee, usually between 150-200 SEK, and drinks inside are usually pretty price (so stick to beer or make sure to pre-drink before). A good tip is to check out Facebook or their websites, and sign up for a guest list – usually it will give you free entrance before a certain time. Trädgården /Under Bron is one of the most popular places to go dancing in Stockholm, especially during the summer time! The que is always quite long, so get there in good time, maybe even in the afternoon and just hang out and have a drink! It’s filled with nice people, good music, and good drinks – and they also have a photo booth! Kåken is one of my personal favorites, it has a bit of a 20s vibe, usually throw fun quizzes, or events during weekends, and a nice place to hang out all year around. In the summer, they have the patio open but keep in mind it can get very busy!"https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/12/where-to-stay-cheap-in-europe-hotel-review/,sweden,"Where to Stay in Europe: Budget Hotel and Hostel Reviews As soon as we walked into our room in Munich, I had to say it. “I hate to admit this,” I told my blogging partner Yoshke, who was in charge of booking our accommodations, “But you did great finding these hotels.” “Of course,” he answered. The smug look on his face turned smugger. But giving credit to where credit is due, it was truly amazing how he was able to find good hotels and hostels that are within the very limited budget range and the multiple restrictions that we set for this two-month European trip.       More than snagging cheap flight tickets or tours, it was booking rooms that was the most time-consuming and painstaking part of preparing for this journey. If this happened years ago, it would have been a lot easier. Years ago, we were okay with dorms, and searching for dorm beds is a piece of cake most of the time. Over the past couple of years, both Yoshke and I started snoring loudly, scandalously, relentlessly. (Between the two of us, Yoshke is way worse, though.) We didn’t want to upset roommates so we settled with private rooms. It’s a bit pricier, but we do it for world peace. You might be thinking, why do you have to book rooms in advance? Isn’t travel more fun when done spontaneously? Well, yeah, travel is more fun without a plan, but the thing is: This is Europe and we’re holding a Philippine passport. Hotel reservations are REQUIRED when applying for a visa. And we had a very limited budget, we couldn’t afford any costly surprises. But before you read our short reviews below, please take note of the following: WE PAID FOR THESE HOTELS IN FULL . None of these are sponsored. None. Nada. Nil. Zilch. You can count on these reviews to be unbiased and absolutely objective. The rates displayed here are the actual amount we shelled out when we booked them . The figures may change depending on the season and demand. We traveled from mid-September to mid-November, which is considered shoulder period. If you travel in June-August or December, rates may be higher. Book early! We booked just a few weeks before the actual trip. There were better and cheaper options but they were fully-booked already. But we would always check the website to see if there were slots that opened up. These are all private rooms. However, some of these don’t have a private bathroom. We actually don’t mind shared bathrooms and toilets as long as they’re clean. We were cool with it. With only a couple of exceptions, almost all of those we booked are situated so close to most attractions or the train terminal or both . If you’re on a multi-city Euro trip, you might want to do the same because walking around with a heavy backpack can be exhausting. Now that we have that out of the way, below is a list of all the hotels, hostels, and apartments where we stayed, including what we thought about them, what we liked, what we didn’t like so much, and what else you might need to know.   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE?

Important Reminders Related Posts Paris: Au Royal Mad Address : 68 rue Sedaine, 75011 Paris, France Au Royal Mad Hotel Paris Paris has a lot of lodging options, but those that are close to key attractions are pricey, as expected. Since we couldn’t find one near the key sites, we took a look at the Metro map and scanned the areas near the metro lines that serve these places. That’s how we found Au Royal Mad, which is just a short walk from Voltaire Station. Bastille and the Pere Lachaise Cemetery are both within walking distance too. We booked a double room with shared bathroom. It’s hard to classify this hotel. It’s not a full-service hotel but it isn’t a hostel or a guesthouse, either. While the place is old, something that became apparent even before we stepped into the building, we actually quite enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at around 7PM and we were greeted by their accommodating receptionist, which briefed us quickly — what’s our room number, where the toilet and bathrooms are located, and so on. The room wasn’t spacious and it was equipped with a sink, a mini-fridge, and a microwave oven. That microwave saved us a few bucks because we would just buy food from a nearby grocery store and heat it in the room, instead of eating out. The place could use a bit of renovation, to be honest, but it’s so cheap. It’s one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for cases. But both the room and the bathroom are always tidy and well-maintained. How to get to Au Royal Mad Hotel : From Voltaire Station, head northwest along Boulevard Voltaire. Turn left onto Rue Sedaine. The hotel should be on your left. Cost : EUR 57 (USD 60) a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Great location. Lots of cheap dining options in the vicinity. Fast internet connection. Clean toilet rooms. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, we could hear everybody passing by the hallway. Steep staircase. Check rates and availability here   Brussels: 2GO4 Quality Hostel Address : Boulevard Emile Jacqmain-laan 99, Brussels 1000, Belgium 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Bedroom Our first impression: This is probably a new hostel. We’re not sure if it is, but it looks and feels new. It’s squeaky clean, every nook and cranny! It’s just a block from the Rogier Metro Station, just a short walk away. We arrived at 3:30pm. The place must have been fully-booked that day because the reception was so busy, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Its distance from the city’s historic center is kinda weird. It’s not that close but it’s not that far. It’s a bit of a long walk, but if you take the subway, you feel silly because it’s not really far? You know what I mean? Haha. Still, we chose to travel on foot each time because y’know, we love walking. There is a common area on the ground floor, where guests can hang and socialize. And there’s a vendo, too, for late-night soda fix. 2GO4 Quality Hostel – Toilet and Bathroom How to get to 2GO4 Quality Hostel : From Rogier Station, walk down Boulevard Anvers/Baudouin and left toward Boulevard Emile Jacqmain. 2GO4 Quality Hostel will be on the left. Cost : EUR 58 (USD 61) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Super clean. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores around. Fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Small rooms. And super-small elevator. Check rates and availability here   Reykjavik: Helga’s Apartment (AirBnB) Address : Bergstadastraeti Street, Ground Floor Reykjavik, Capital Region 101, Iceland AirBnB Reykjavik Iceland Unless you’re staying in a dorm, finding an affordable place to stay in Reykjavik can be challenging, to say the least. Iceland, in general, is expensive and the same can be said about accommodations here. We could’ve snagged cheap rooms if we booked early, but we didn’t have that much lead time. Anyway, after so many attempts with Booking.com, we finally gave up and explored other options. We’re not that big of a fan of AirBnB, to be honest, only because we don’t like the idea of being extra wary or being worried that we might upset or disturb our host. Staying in someone else’s home just feels different from staying in a hotel. But we didn’t have any other option at this point. “AirBnB it is, fine.” But it turned out to be a fantastic experience. Helga, our host, was so accommodating, friendly, and helpful. Even before we arrived, she made sure it would be easy for us to find her place, a small apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining area, and a shared toilet. Within 30 minutes of arrival, Helga shared cheap restaurant recommendations and directions to key spots in town. The apartment is located in the downtown Reykjavik. It is just meters from the Old Town’s main road, near restaurants, shops, and other establishments. We could easily buy or eat anytime we want. It is also just next to Reykjavik4you Apartments, which is widely known. It’s important because most tour services use hotels as pickup and dropoff places, and since it’s AirBnb, it doesn’t have a name. But you can simply say Reykjavik 4U and they know exactly where it is. The downside is that there’s no bathroom, only a shared toilet room. The reason for this is that Icelanders traditionally go to public baths. But it’s something that Helga has been very transparent with. She made sure it is prominently highlighted in her listing and as soon as we booked, she made sure we were completely aware of it. We didn’t have any issues with it because we dig public baths. Teehee. How to get to Reykjavik AirBnB apartment : From Keflavik airport, book a FlyBus or Grayline bus and tell them to drop you off at Rekjavik4you Apartments, which is the building next to Helga’s apartment. Cost : USD 75 – 90 for the whole apartment. What we loved : Super helpful host. Neat and tidy. Excellent location. Very fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : No bathroom. But again, we knew this going in. Check rates and availability here   Copenhagen: Globalhagen Hostel Address : Ravnsborggade 11, 2200 København N, Denmark Globalhagen Hostel Bedroom Probably our best hostel experience in Europe! It’s a non-profit hostel located in Copenhagen’s young and vibrant Nørrebro district. The nearest train station is Norreport, from which you will have to walk 6 blocks and cross a bridge. We arrived a little early for our check-in but they assisted us and allowed us to leave our luggage in the hostel as we explored the city. They’re extremely organized here. Every room has its own country theme. The room assigned to us, Australian-themed, was big enough for 3 people. The shared bathrooms are regularly kept tidy. On the floor above the rooms, there is an open kitchen where some free ingredients are up for grabs and a huge dining area. Around the area are a lot of restaurants that locals frequent. (Oh there’s also a cafe downstairs where guests and other customers can hygge.) The only not-so-positive thing we can say about this is that it’s pretty pricey. Normally, a night’s stay here costs around USD 66, but I don’t know why the rates during our stay was USD 98. And it wasn’t even a weekend. A local whom we talked to was also shocked by the cost. She said there could be a big event happening in the city so the demand was high, ergo the steep prices. We were supposed to stay in Copenhagen for 5 nights, but because we couldn’t find any affordable place to stay here during that time (not even AirBnB), we decided to just spend the last 2 nights in Malmo, Sweden. How to get to Globalhagen Hostel : From Norreport train station, just walk along Frederiksborggade towards the bridge (northeast). Once you make it over the bridge, turn right onto Ryesgade/Ravnsborggade. Globalhagen Hostel will be on the left. Cost : USD 98 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet rooms, bathrooms, and bed room. Supermarkets, pubs and convenience stores in the vicinity. Realiable internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Steep rates. And no elevator (?). Book here .   Malmo: Hotel Continental Malmo Address : Hospitalgatan 2, Malmo City Center, Malmo, Sweden, 211 33 Hotel Continental Malmo Bedroom This 2-story, 2-star hotel is the cheapest we found in the city. We arrived at night and were greeted by the staff (the owners?) and their very adorable pitbull. It’s neat but you could tell it’s past its prime, to put it mildly. It is a hotel, but it actually gives off an “inn” vibe, for some reason. The hotel is located just a block from Lilla Torg (Little Square), a famous attraction surrounded by expensive restaurants and shopping staples (H&amp;M, Zara, etc.). It is also 750 meters (10-minute walk) from Malmo Station. Hotel Continental Malmo Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Continental Malmo : From Malmo Train station, head south on Skeppsbron, cross the bridge, and turn right onto Norra Vallgatan. Turn left onto Gråbrödersgatan, turn right onto Västergatan, turn left again onto Långgårdsgatan. Hotel Continental Malmo will be on the fourth corner. Cost : USD 132.5 for a twin or double room with private bathroom What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. Reliable internet connection. Close to Lilla Torg. What we didn’t like so much : We know Sweden is an expensive country, but this just doesn’t feel like it was worth it. Check rates and availability here .   Amsterdam: Inner Hotel Inner Amsterdam Bedroom Bad news first: Inner Amsterdam is far from the central train station and the main square. A 25-30-minute tram ride is needed to get here. The good news is, it stands near Van Gogh Museum (which was a big reason why we’re in Amsterdam in the first place) and the Rijksmuseum. When we arrived, the hotel and some of its rooms are currently under renovation, something that the hotel badly needed because there are parts of the building (like the reception and the room they provided) that look dated. Some guests would sit on the stairs because the wifi, they say, didn’t reach their rooms. The thing is, the room assigned to us was first you’ll see if you’re taking the stairs so we could hear other guests go up and down, their conversations, and their drunken movements at night. Despite all this, I enjoyed our stay here. We sleep like a rock so we didn’t mind the noise, and our room was the closest to the reception so we had good reception (and we had our own connection, anyway). I’m not sure how I would feel if we were given another room. (Some rooms were newly renovated though.) At the very least, what matters to me is that the room was well-maintained, the bathroom clean, and the staff friendly, and Inner Hotel met those. And again, it’s not far from the reasons why we’re in town: Van Gogh Museum and Albert Cuyp Markt. Inner Amsterdam Toilet &amp; Bathroom Address : Wanningstraat 1, Oud Zuid, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1071 LA How to get to Inner Amsterdam Hotel : From Amsterdam Centraal, walk southwest on Westtunnel toward Stationsplein, take the Nieuw Sloten (2) tram and get off at Amsterdam, Van Baerlestraat station, walk southwest on Paulus Potterstraat toward Van Baerlestraat, continue onto Willemsparkweg, turn left onto Alexander Boersstraat, turn right onto Van Breestraat, turn left onto Wanningstraat, Inner Amsterdam will be on the left. Cost : EUR 74 (USD 78) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet room, bathroom, and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Thin walls, you could hear the slightest movements outside. Check rates and availability here Prague: Hotel Opletalova Address : Opletalova 13, Prague, 110 00, Czech Republic Hotel Opletalova Prague – Bedroom Of all the places we stayed in Europe, this one gave the best value for money. Sometimes, you just get lucky and this is one of those times! It’s so cheap, it’s more like a steal! And the location is perfect! It’s only 5-minute walk from Václavské náměstí (Wenceslas Square) where the famous 14th-century square, Czech Republic’s National Museum, and St. Wenceslas statue are located. This is where the Velvet revolution of 500,000 people happened. Service is also commendable. The receptionists were always so eager to help and sincere in making sure we had a great time in their city. They assisted us in booking tours, referred laundry services, and answered with a smile every single question we threw at them. It’s cheap, too. Oh wait, I said that already. But seriously. Prague is generally known for low cost of living, but we didn’t expect hotel rates to go as low as this. For only USD 32 a night, we booked a private QUADRUPLE ROOM (with two twin beds and a bunk bed). We’re just 2 people, but it was the only room available, and because it’s within our budget, we went with it. How to get to Hotel Opletalova : At the arrival exit, look for the public transportation booth and buy your one day pass or 3 hour pass for 32 Czech Crowns. Go to Terminal 1 and look for bus going to Nádraží Veleslavín (119), from Nádraží Veleslavín take the metro going to Skalka (Platform A), alight at Můstek – A station, walk southeast on Václavské nám and turn left onto Opletalova. Hostel Opletalova should be on your left. Cost : EUR 30 (USD 32) for a twin or double room. What we loved : Clean bathroom and bedroom. Excellent location, just next to Wenceslas Square, with lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow and unreliable internet connection. Check rates and availability here .   Vienna: Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Address : Mariahilfer Straße 137, 15. Rudolfsheim-Fünfh., Vienna, Austria, 1150 Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Bedroom This is not close to Vienna’s major attractions. It’s a 2.9km walk to the Opera House and a 2.3km walk to Schönbrunn Palace. However, it’s just a short distance from the Wien Westbahnhof (West Station), which is one of the city’s major train terminals. It proved convenient when we went to Bratislava and Budapest from Vienna. There are also a lot of cheap restaurants around serving a great variety of cuisines from Asian, Turkish, to Austrian. There’s also a supermarket next door. We booked a double room and it was big. Even the ensuite bathroom was big. The staff was also accommodating. Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge Toilet and Bathroom How to get to Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge : From Vienna Central Station, take Stadthalle (Tram #18) and get off at Wien Westbahnhoff, exit on the right and cross Mariahilfer Straße, Wombats City Hostel Vienna – The Lounge will be on the left. Cost : EUR 56.4 (USD 59) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. A lot of cheap restaurants and convenience stores around. What we didn’t like so much : Slow internet connection. Far from tourist destinations. Check rates and availability here .   Munich: Euro Youth Hotel Address : Senefelder str 5, Ludwigsvorstadt, Munich, Germany, 80336 Euro Youth Hotel Munich Bedroom The streets surrounding Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) are flanked by budget hotels and hostels. One of these is Euro Youth Hostel, where we stayed in Munich. Because it’s close to the train station, there are a lot of establishments around — restaurants, shops, drugstores. The city’s historic center is also just a short walk away. We couldn’t think of a better location. The meeting points of most tours in Munich are in the historic center (walking tours) and the train station (day tours to attractions outside the city like Dachau and Neuschwanstein Castle). Euro Youth Hostel is conveniently located in between. The room was bare, with only a closet, a TV set, a dining table, and a sink, but it was huge. Our booking came with free breakfast, too! How to get to Euro Youth Hotel : From Hauptbahnhof, walk east on Bahnhofshalle toward Bahnhofpl. Turn right onto Bahnhofpl, turn right onto Bayerstraße, turn left onto Senefelderstraße. Destination will be on the left. Cost : EUR 60 (USD 63) for a twin or double room with shared bathroom and FREE breakfast. What we loved : Fantastic location. Reliable internet connection. Clean toilet, bathroom and bedroom. What we didn’t like so much : Hard to find anything bad, but if we’re nitpicking, the elevator is weird? Or that the water pressure at the sink can get too strong, it can get messy fast. LOL. Check rates and availability here .   Zurich: Ramada Hotel Zurich was the last hotel we booked because we couldn’t find anything lower than USD100 per night. All the hostels and apartments were fully booked. The cheapest hotels that we could find at the time were at around USD 200. AirBnB was expensive too. (Damn, we should really try to book early next time). So we waited and hoped that someone would cancel. Someone did. And as soon as a slot opened up, we grabbed it. It was with Ramada Hotel Zurich City. It cost us USD 115 per night, but it was the best we could find. This is a full-service hotel, although it wasn’t that big. It’s only a few stories high, and located a bit far from the city center. As you would expect from a Ramada Hotel, our stay was comfortable, everything is clean, the rooms are equipped with hotel staples like TV set, air-conditioner and heater, desks, and complimentary drinks and toiletries. Pretty usual. I guess what I didn’t like so much was the CHF100/night guarantee-deposit, which I think is too steep. (We didn’t want to use our cards. It was the end of the month and we were worried we have maxed it out already.) Moreover, the staff at the reception wasn’t warm, friendly, or polite. When we asked them questions, they answered in a cold, annoyed tone. Except on our last day, when we checked out. The lady at the reception that morning was sweet and helpful. How to get to Ramada Hotel Zurich City : From Zurich Central, take Tram #3 and get off at Stauffacher. Transfer to Tram #2 and alight at Letzigrund. From here, travel on foot and follow the direction of the tram. You’ll find Ramada on your left. Another way is to ride Tram #3 straight to Hubertus Station. If you’re facing towards where the tram is going, turn right onto Letzigraben. When you hit the roundabout, turn left. Keep walking for a block and you’ll see Ramada on your left. Cost : CHF 119 (USD 115.75) for a twin room with private bathroom. What we loved : Full-service. Clean, well-equipped rooms, fast internet connection. What we didn’t like so much : Far from the city center. Unfriendly staff. Check rates and availability here .   Florence: Bronze Horse Guesthouse Address : Via Della Condotta 3, Historical Center, Florence, Italy, 50122 Bronze Horse Bedroom Florence Italy We weren’t expecting much. If anything, we were a bit concerned because we have ready some horrible reviews of this place, but the cheap rates and perfect location were too much of a pull. We took a leap of faith and we were rewarded. Bronze Horse is a two-room apartment unit being rented out to tourists. It’s located on Level 3 of an old building at the heart of Florence’s historic center. The owners-managers-caretakers of the place don’t stay here, so if you’re checking in, you will need to schedule it beforehand. The bulk of the usual complaints about this place was about not being able to arrange a check-in time, leaving the guests outside for a long time. Thankfully, we didn’t have that experience. Our entire stay was pleasant, comfortable, and smooth, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are being cleaned every other day, and the people in charge were friendly when they’re around. But its best asset really is its location. Most Old Town attractions — piazzas, churches, museums, monuments, and restaurants — are within walking distance. You’ll even pass by the Duomo on your way here from Firenze Sta Maria Novella (Florence Central Train Station). That 15-minute walk from the station itself was a highlight of our stay as it allowed us to see much of the city for the first time. Overall, we looooved our stay here, and it’s something we can recommend in a heartbeat. Especially given its price. How to get to Bronze Horse : From Firenze Sta Maria Novella, walk west on Piazza della Stazione, turn right toward Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, slight right onto Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, continue onto Via Panzani, via Panzani turns slightly left and becomes Via de’ Cerretani, continue straight onto Piazza S. Giovanni, turn right onto Piazza del Duomo, continue onto Via dei Calzaiuoli, turn left onto Via della Condotta, destination will be on the right. Cost : USD 60 for a twin or double room with shared bathroom. What we loved : Perfect location. Fast internet connection. Clean, spacious toilet and bath. What we didn’t like so much : There’s only one bathroom so it can be a problem sometimes. The main door of the unit was difficult to unlock. Took us at least 3 minutes before we could finally enter. Haha. Check rates and availability here .   Rome: Hotel Leone Address : Via Cavour 47, Termini Central Station, Rome, Italy, 00184 Hotel Leone Rome Italy – Bedroom Another guesthouse-type hotel. The room we got was tidy, nice and pleasant. There was nothing despicable, but nothing particularly memorable, either. Pretty average. Located just 6-8-minute walk from Roma Termina (Rome Central Station). The staff was always accommodating. There were times of the day that they would lock the main door to the rooms (to which they didn’t provide keys), but they were always glad to open it for us, no problem. When we first entered the room, though, we could tell that the previous guests had a drink inside because it kind of reeked of red wine. And although it was close to the central train station, it wasn’t really within close proximity of any other point of interest. But since Rome was our last stop, we thought it would be best to choose a place that is close to the station so we won’t have to carry heavy baggage that long. Hotel Leone Rome Italy Toilet &amp; Bathroom How to get to Hotel Leone : From Rome Central Station, head southwest and turn right onto Via Giovanni Giolitti. Turn left onto Via Cavour. Hotel Leone will be on the right. Cost : EUR 46.5 (USD 48.5) for a twin or double room with private bathroom. What we loved : Good internet connection. Clean toilet and bath. Near Roma Termini. What we didn’t like so much : Not close to key attractions."https://hippie-inheels.com/sample-western-europe-itinerary/,switzerland,"Sample Backpacking Western Europe Itinerary Western europe was the first trip I took abroad. I was so new to travel I didn’t think of it as Western Europe because I was completely unfamiliar with the East. It was just Europe! I’ve put together a sample Western Europe Itinerary that could be done over the course of 1-2 months, or of course longer if you want to travel slower. This is the route I took my first time abroad. It’s not perfect; I missed some cool places but I did hit the popular “highlights”. I’ve written about each place already but thought it would be helpful to see it all in one post. In order to travel this route, it was all by train, metro, and local bus once. I actually never had to take a cab. Okay, there was also some hitchhiking. I bought a Eurail pass &amp; did have to make reservations in the popular cities. I visited during summer. Each city has a link to a blog post written about it with tips. Before you start planning your Western Europe itinerary, make sure you… Find a cheap flight on using my tips . Get travel insurance with World Nomads. Here’s a comparison of plans and price calculator . You can usually stay just 90 days as a tourist. Backpacking Western Europe Sample Itinerary Sample Western Europe Itinerary 1. London, UK . A staple in any itinerary to Europe, London has so much to see that you’ll NEED at least 3 days but could of course spend more time here. Your feet will hurt after all the sightseeing but from Big Ben to the London Eye and Westminster Abbey, it’s pretty dreamy. I see people walking to and from work past such amazing architecture and think maybe I could do a 9-5 if it was in London. Here are some Luxury tips for London and here’s a guide for a revisit to London . 2. Paris, France . Of course you should spend a couple of days in Paris. Beware it’s a little hard on the budget. Before the movie “Taken” came out, we were in a train station in Paris trying to think of where to spend the night when a cute young Parisian guy noticed we were lost and offered us his home. It was awesome and we saw Paris with him over the next few days. Sometimes travel is about taking risks, and this one paid off! 3. Zurich, Switzerland.  Certainly not my favorite place on this list, but a hub nonetheless. We were forced to go here when trying to leave Paris for Rome and realizing the train was full for two days. This is a problem sometimes in the popular summer months. We showed up the day of the Summer Parade and it was WILD! Again, we couchsurfed but stayed only 1 night because it wasn’t part of our itinerary. 4. Finale Ligure, Italy. We wanted to go somewhere that was on the coast, but not as expensive. I saw online this castle you can stay in Italy for 20 bucks  so I emailed them right away to make a booking. It was a cute town and a great introduction to Italy. We stayed 3 days. 5. Rome, Italy.  WOW! This is a city that takes some time to see (Colosseum, Vatican city) . We made a mistake of not staying long enough. It is a bit overwhelming so I suggest taking a free walking tour through your hostel. Another suggestion is stay somewhere a bit pricier if it means you’re closer to the center of town. You’ll save on transport- not only money but more importantly TIME. Turn on your JavaScript to view content 6. Florence, Italy.  Florence was just stunning. I’ve never forget walking the market with gelato and watching the sunsets. You’ll need to save extra with the intention of buying leather in Florence and other goodies like pashmina scarves (which are clearly fake since they are 5 usd). I stayed 3 days here. 7. Venice, Italy.  I know I should go back to Venice because I was a little worn out and didn’t really enjoy my time there. I feel like all I saw were tourists and it was packed to the brim. People go for a reason tough: the little lanes of water and boats instead of cars. Expect high tourist priced food here that won’t be as good as other places. Stay 1 or 2 days. Here are some Venice travel tips . 8. Vienna, Austria.  This was also during my “burnt out” phase and also we showed up on a Saturday night, Sunday everything was closed, and Monday we left. I’ve been back since, actually this month, and got to see a lot more. A post on that is coming soon! 9. Salzburg, Austria.  The COOLEST place in Europe, maybe!? I loved Salzburg. Talk about a fairytale land. It’s incredible. We went to a beer garden first, got drunk, realized we had nowhere to stay, and crashed with new friends we made at the cutest little Austrian farm-house. Unreal little town! Stay a couple of days at least. The museums and fortress are really cool. A little peak into the magic of Salzburg’s fortress . Turn on your JavaScript to view content 10. Interlaken, Switzerland. If you’re traveling solo, this is a town you’re sure to meet some people. There are two popular hostels and lots of youngsters hanging out for extended amounts of time. Hang-glide, paraglide, sky dive, ice climb, rock climb, kayak, or canyon; this is the epitome of adventure in Europe. Situated between two glacier lakes, with the Swiss Alps in the background, it’s the most beautiful place I’ve seen. Stay 4 days or more so you can do more activities and budget for them. Read more; Guide to Interlaken and Canyoning Interlaken . 11. Berlin, Germany.  Berlin is the “cool” city of Europe. It’s trendy, fashionable, has great clubs and bars, and has some very open-minded people. Overall, I never hear travelers say a bad thing about Berlin. I think it was a bit cliquey and many cool places are hush-hush, so Couchsurfing and meeting locals is imperative here. I also LOVED the free walking tour of Berlin and learned a lot. 12. Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Amsterdam is full of history, but it’s also full of “coffee shops” and you’ll need to make a bit of an itinerary so that you can be sure to see what’s there. I was 19 and did not see all that I should have. Walking the streets and seeing the lifestyle and everyone riding around on bicycles is adorable so even if you did nothing, you’d see a cool scene. 13. Delft, Den Haag, Maastricht.  I’m putting all this together because they’re all very small towns in Holland. I changed my flight and stayed solo when my travel buddy went home and Couchsurfed to these towns. They were very cute and fun. I recommend seeing one country a little more in-depth and I chose Holland (because it seemed safe). Couchsurfing Holland was ideal because I had a host and I really got to see the towns the way locals do. Delft was my favorite. A few extras… You’ll have noticed I missed biggies like Ireland and Spain.  They usually require flights which I couldn’t afford, so I waited and hit these up on my next trip to Europe, before I traveled onward to Eastern Europe. I don’t want to write about Ireland and Spain in my “Eastern Europe” post as it’ll confuse people, so will mention them here, now. If you have the budget, add Dublin to the top of this list, and head to Spain after France, before Italy. Dublin, Ireland.  One of the many places that I wish I’d had more time in- but not in Dublin. Two days were enough in Dublin, but I wanted a week to see the countryside (a week which I didn’t have). I did take a train out and see a bit, but it’s truly gorgeous so don’t spend too much time in Dublin downing Guinness. 7 Travel Tips for Dublin . Madrid, Spain.  Madrid was culturally impressive but for me, a little boring. Many people argue about which is better: Madrid or Barcelona? But I think they are so different you can’t really compare. Madrid seemed more old-fashioned to me. Tips on backpacking Madrid . my couchsurfing hosts in Madrid who showed us everything! Barcelona, Spain.  The party place! I had a BLAST in Barcelona, even though I got pickpocketed and had to call my couchsurfing host from jail . Eating delicious food, downing sangria, checking out amazing art like Park Guell, and enjoying the incredible nightlife. Nowhere has such life in it like Barcelona. Valencia, Spain.  Valencia was much more chilled out, kind of like a typical beach town- but old school. I really enjoyed my time here although didn’t stay in “Old Town” as we should have. The beach was stunning and we had a blast at the bars. I did find the buses hard to navigate mainly because of language barriers."https://hippie-inheels.com/things-to-do-in-zanzibar/,tanzania,"Complete Guide to Zanzibar + 15 Things to do in Zanzibar Few places in the world can induce images of pristine turquoise waters, white powdered sandy beaches and tropical palm-tree paradise. Zanzibar is one of them. Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous territory of Tanzania is located just off the country’s coast but with its own unique heritage and cultural flavor it feels like an entirely different world. It offers a unique culture experience along with being the most tranquil setting for pure relaxation. I can safely say that I found my personal slice of paradise here. There are plenty great places on the island so in order to get the best experience and see the highlights I would recommend spending three weeks or more. What I wouldn’t recommend is rushing around Zanzibar like many people do, as this is a destination worth exploring slowly. Zanzibar is a relatively small island but it’s still big enough to the point where you have to decide where to go, and which destination will best suit your interests. That’s why it’s always important to have an itinerary planned before you start traveling and that being said I’ve done all the research for you and created this three-week itinerary for Zanzibar that I can promise will be a holiday that you will always remember.  Three-week itinerary for Zanzibar Island Month: Mid October, which was a good call, as islands most touristic months are June to September, during the dry and windy season and January-February for highest temperatures. Stone Town Suggested time: 4-5 days Stone Town isn’t just any town. It is a sensory experience not to be found anywhere else in the world that offers a unique look into the melting pot of cultures. Things to do in Stone Town Zanzibar: Explore local markets Darajani Market is where you find locals hustling all day long. And what it makes it so authentic is the noise and the colors. It is also the place where you can find all possible spices. Visit Prison Island Prison Island is only 25 minutes away from Stone Town. Once used as a place for detention of rebellious slaves and people with deadly diseases, it is now converted into a tourist attraction with one of the main draws being giant tortoises. They’re not only ginormous but also as old as 192 years! Dine at Forodhani Gardens When it comes to street food, your visit to Zanzibar is not complete without experiencing the Forodhani night market. It’s by far the cheapest and busiest place to eat. You will find stands with fresh seafood, samosas and grilled vegetables. My favorites would be Zanzibar beef pizza and chicken shawarma. Finger licking good! Get lost wandering narrow alleys Stone Town is a where you’ll find a mixture of Arabic, Indian, African and European cultures living comfortably together under one roof. The labyrinthine streets are the most beautiful of all the sights you can find. Wander the maze of narrow streets and dark winding alleys. This way you will get a glimpse into the sense of a local community. Stay in Persian influenced hotel One of the great things about Stone Town is the grand colonial architecture, which gives an opportunity to stay in Persian style hotels. And the best part is many of them have their own, unique character. It is worth researching and investing in authenticity. It’s like living museums dedicated to furniture, art and oriental ornaments. Here are two of our favorite hotels in Stone Town Zanzibar: Zanzibar Palace Hotel . This is a cute boutique restored hotel in the hear of town with incredible service. Emerson on Hurumzi . This is a restored merchant’s mansion with a popular rooftop restaurant. There are also many museums and other tours you can visit but what really made me experience the authenticity of this town is beyond the touristic route. Nungwi/Kendwa Suggested time: 5days Nungwi and Kendwa (located just a 5 min drive from Nungwi) is said to have best full moon parties on the island therefore it attracts younger, backpacking crowd. It also has the best beaches in Zanzibar  for swimming due to the tide that doesn’t head out too far. Things to do in Nungwi Kendwa Zanzibar: Enjoy a famous sunset Dhow cruise Dhow, a wooden built boat with a canvas sail, were originally introduced from Yemen hundreds of years ago. They still play a very important role of transportation and fishing on the island. You can arrange a private or group cruise via hotel or any ‘beach boy’. Like Stone Town, sunsets are absolutely incredible in Nungwi as well. Enjoy seafood dinner Nungwi has many options to feast on seafood. There is a fresh fish stalls at every restaurant, making it a perfect place to enjoy prawn or lobster dishes. Our top choice of hotel in Nungwi Zanzibar area is Kendwa Rocks which is a very hip guesthouse that offers bungalow and wooden beach huts. They have parties here as well. Matemwe Suggested time: 3 days If you prefer some time alone, try Matemwe beach. Here, you can really escape to serenity and walk on a beach for miles without meeting another soul. It’s the place where you’ll want to ditch your shoes and walk barefoot while enjoying the sand and admiring natural coastline. Things to do in Matemwe Tanzania: Indulge in luxury holidaymaking Area is popular with private luxury resorts promising a relaxing stay as nearby village life goes at an attractively sleepy and quite pace. Here you can disconnect from outside world and spend a few days pampering yourself. I’ve stayed in Bahari Villas and loved every minute spent lounging by the pool and sipping virgin coladas. Snorkel or dive around Mnemba Island Zanzibar is excellent for its diving and snorkeling. Mnemba Atoll is one of the favorites amongst underwater lovers. Zanzibar is home to wide variety of fishes and colorful corals. Snorkel across shores of Mnemba Island and enjoy the stunning creatures living underwater. There is also a chance spotting dolphins on the way, as they are frequent guests in local waters. There are a couple great hotels in Matemwe to check out. We love both these unique boutique properties: Matemwe Beach Retreat . The infinity pool at this property blows our mind! It doesn’t get better than this. Matemwe Lodge . This is set up next to the white sand up on some rocks. Very romantic! Paje Suggested time: 7 days Paje is located on the South East of Zanzibar. It is referred as a kite surfing mecca and is popular not only for the most beautiful beach on the island but also for water sports. It is by far my favorite spot in Zanzibar and place where I’ve spent longest. The atmosphere is nice and laid back, and it’s a perfect place to either meet new friends or to keep to yourself and just enjoy the beach. Things to do in Paje Zanzibar: Kitesurf Kitesurf is one of the most fun activities you can try out during your stay in Zanzibar. Due to reliable winds and large shallow lagoons on the east coast, Zanzibar became widely recognised as one of the best locations for kitesurfing in Africa. Whether you are a first-timer or an expert, professional surf schools will equip you with everything you need to catch the breeze. Go reef walking At low tide, waves recede more than a kilometer. It is a best time to go explore the far away reef. Be extra careful avoiding sea urchins as some areas fully covered with spikes. You will see many sea cucumbers, starfishes and small octopuses. It is also a time when locals are spare fishing; they might even show you their methods and the catch of the day if you’re lucky. Spend a day on a Safari Blue tour The original Safari Blue tour is one of the most popular day trips from Stone Town but you can also find people offering very similar trips from Paje at much lower price. A Safari Blue day is packed with adventure; you will sail on traditional hand built mahogany sailing dhow, have a chance to snorkel around crystal clear turquoise waters, sunbathe on an isolated sandbank and feast on delicious grilled fresh seafood lunch. All of this can be bargained for $30pp. Visit Rock restaurant Try typing Zanzibar on google. What images do you get? A beautiful old little house built on a rock in water. That’s The Rock restaurant, which is situated only 12km from Paje. Take a taxi or catch a local dala-dala and visit this incredible place. Although, food is overpriced, choose a glass of wine instead and spend an hour on a terrace watching the ocean. Watch wildlife at Jozani forest Wildlife lovers may want to trek into the Jozani Forest in search of red colobus monkeys, a species that can only be found in Zanzibar. It is also home to Sykes monkey, Ader’s duiker, bush babies, over 50 species of butterfly, 40 species of birds and 100 species of trees. There’s only one hotel we recommend here in Paje Zanzibar and that’s Dhow Inn . It’s modern, clean, and spacious plus it is just one minute walk to the beach. Jambiani Suggested stay: 2 days This is a place where you can take it slow after vibrant Paje and indulge in relaxation and peacefulness. It’s great for swimming and watersports but also rich with local culture and village life. If strolling along the beach you will see women harvesting seaweed during low tide. Things to do in Jambiani Zanzibar You can also arrange a deep-sea fishing trip via Red Monkey Lodge. This guesthouse in Jambiana is good on the budget at just $60 a night: Indigo Beach in Bwejuu  is your perfect idyllic beach shack. You don’t need anything more than this paradise. Food you should try in Zanzibar With its strategic location, Zanzibar has long been a melting pot. The result is a truly unique Zanzibar culture and a mixture of marvelous cuisines. Indulge and try their dishes. Biryani. Where the rice is cooked in a variety of spices, and paired together with a meat or fish curry, that always accompanies the rice. It is one of the most famous dishes to eat in Zanzibar. Zanzibar pizza. As I’ve mentioned it before, it’s one of my favorites. It doesn’t look nor taste like a traditional pizza but nonetheless is absolutely delicious! They basically thin out a ball of dough, put whatever ingredients you asked- like chicken or beef with mixture of vegetables, then add an egg and cheese on top and start frying it on a hot pan surface. Mishkaki . In other words it’s like skewers or kebab smaller version. You’ll find people grilling them up in the late afternoon all over Zanzibar. Chips Mayai. This is what we call French fries omelette. They go well with chilli and mishkaki skewers. You can get them anywhere on the street for less then a dollar. Pilau rice . Unlike biryani, where the rice and dish are cooked separately, pilau is a combination of rice, meat and spices cooked together. It’s a bit drier than biryani but also has a bit more flavor. I hope this itinerary has given you an idea of where to go and what to see during your time in Zanzibar. And you can soon get started thinking about this paradise as your next holiday destination."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2013/03/wat-pho-wat-arun-temples-bangkok-thailand/,thailand,"6 Popular Attractions in Bangkok: A DIY Boat + Walking Tour Much has been said about Bangkok being so touristy. But that’s a given. As the world’s most visited city, Bangkok is such a crowd-drawer that it is almost impossible to find a tourist-less frame whenever you try to take a photo of anything. Bangkok’s map is dotted with several tourist spots that most people flock to. Spend at least one day exploring the sites punctuating the Chao Phraya River and see for yourself. Self-proclaimed traveling elites may cringe at you visiting the usual tourist spots but go anyway. There just might be a reason they are on everyone’s maps and guidebooks.       The best thing about the Grand Palace and the great temples of Bangkok is that they stand close to each other. They are also easily accessible via the Chao Phraya Express Boat, which is also connected to the BTS (Skytrain). Here’s a quick guide to help you see six of the top tourist spots along the Chao Phraya. (I’m not saying this is the best, most comprehensive guide there is because it’s not. But this is how I did it given my limited time and energy.) WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Important Reminders 1. Bangkok Chinatown 2. Wat Arun – The Temple of Dawn 3. Wat Pho – The Temple of the Reclining Buddha 4. The Grand Palace 5. Siriraj Forensic Museum 6. Khao San Road Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Important Reminders First, here are some important tips: 1. Make sure you have breakfast because this walk is going to be a long one. 2. Dress appropriately. The Grand Palace has a strict dress code. The temples have more relaxed rules but let’s follow the Grand Palace’s dress code for a smooth tour. The rule is to have your shoulders, knees, and heels covered. The following are not allowed: Shorts, short skirts, mini-skirts, tight fitting trousers, Torn trousers/pants Sando, vests, sleeveless shirts See-through shirts Sandals 3. Beware of scams!  Even before the trip, I kept reading about the rampant scams that target unsuspecting tourists.  Coincidentally, when I was there, Bangkok was featured on Scam City, a National Geographic show that reveals how scammers operate in major cities in the world. True enough, I was approached by these scammers twice. One at Wat Pho. They would introduce themselves as teachers and tell you that the temple is closed because that day is a holiday. They would then tell you of another temple that is open and invite you to ride a tuktuk. Don’t go with them. Decline politely and go inside inside regardless. To begin the tour, make your way to Saphan Taksin Station (S6) of the BTS Silom Line. Take Exit 2, and hop onto a Chao Phraya Express Boat at the Sathorn Pier. 1. Bangkok Chinatown Leng Buai Ia Shrine, the oldest Chinese shrine in Thailand (built 1658). Alight at the Ratchawong Pier (N5) and make your way on foot from Ratchawong Road to Sampeng Lane and Yaowarat Road. Chinatown is popular for its shops, especially near Charoenkrung Road. But there are also temples around the district. To be honest, if you’ve been to other Chinatowns in other parts of Southeast Asia, this one might disappoint you, unless you visit during the Chinese New Year, when the district really comes to life. (If you’re after a tummy-friendly experience, it would be best to visit after sunset.) After spending an hour or two in Chinatown, head back to the river. You may trace your steps back to Ratchawong (N5) or go to Saphan Phut (N6) instead. 2. Wat Arun – The Temple of Dawn Get off at Tha Tien Pier (N8) and take a cross river boat to the other side. You will see Wat Arun from the pier. Located on the west bank of Chao Phraya, Wat Arun Ratcha Wararam Ratchaworamahawihan is dedicated to the second reign of the Chakkri Dynasty. Known to locals at Wat Chaeng or Temple of Dawn, it is believed that King Taksin, after escaping Ayutthaya which was attached by the Burmese, reached the place just before sunrise. He then made the place the chief temple and once housed the precious Emeral Buddha and the Phra Bang (another important image) which were moved from the Lao city of Vientiane. Statue of King Rama beside the prang of Wat Arun A yaksha and the 70m spire of Wat Arun Wat Arun is probably the most recognizable landmark in Bangkok. The most captivating feature of the wat is its 70m tall spire (called prang ) that towers over the Yai district and the Chao Phraya River. Even from the ferry, it is the first glorious sight if you’re coming from the Sapan Taksin BTS Station. Its intricate architecture and its picturesque location make it one of the most postcard perfect views in the city. It is best photographed at sunset when it is illuminated, a standout, shining structure at the heart of the city. After exploring Wat Arun’s spires, head back to Tha Thien pier. Wat Arun Opening hours: 8:00am-6:30pm Entrance fee: THB 50   3. Wat Pho – The Temple of the Reclining Buddha Tha Thien pier (where you’re standing at this point) is in an area called Rattanakosin Island, bordered by the Chao Phraya to the west. A moat stemming from the river flows around the area, an effective defense in the olden days. The harbors some of Bangkok’s most popular wats (temples), shrines, and other crowd favorites including Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha),  Wat Mahathat, City Pillar Shrine , the Grand Palace , and Wat Pho (Temple of the Reclining Buddha). After returning to Tha Thien pier, follow the way out (you can see it immediately) and you’ll find a street flanked with vendors. Just walk up the road and it will lead you to a temple at the corner. That’s Wat Pho. The gigantic reclining Buddha Wat Pho is famed for the enormous reclining Buddha that it shelters. The 15m high and 43m long image rests inside a well-decorated hall. I was given a small sack to put my shoes in as I was approaching the door. Despite the big crowd outside, I was delightfully surprised to see the hall almost empty. Too bad it lasted for only a minute as others flooded in immediately. While I was expecting the image to be big, I was shocked to stand before a massive, massive figure. Its highly ornate feet alone are 3m tall and 4.5 m long. (Can you picture that?) The statue itself is covered and surrounded with Buddhist and Thai symbols. The wat is home to over 1000 images of Buddha, 91 chedis (stupas), 4 viharas (halls), and a central shrine (bot). Guarding the site are stone walls with 16 gates, “manned” by statues of Chinese giants. One hundred and eight bronze bowls are lined up against the wall in the area behind the statue, towards the exit. These bowls symbolize the 108 auspicious characters of Buddha. Guests circumambulating the image may choose to drop a coin on every bowl for good fortune. These donations also go to the maintenance funds of the temple. For good fortune and maintenance of the wat Just some of the thousand images of Buddha in Wat Pho Wat Pho Opening hours: 8:30am-6:30pm Entrance fee: THB 100   4. The Grand Palace Make your way to the corner of Maha Rat and Thai Wang Alley. You have been to this corner as this is where the road from the pier meets the road adjacent to the temple. If you’re facing the pier side, walk down Maha Rat Road to your right. It should lead you to the entrance to the Grand Palace. You know you’re on the right track if you see a lot of stores selling souvenirs along the way. To your left you will see an alley leading to another pier, Tha Chang (N9). This street is crowded with several stores and restaurants. You may choose to grab a meal here and discover the gourmet quality of Bangkok’s kerbside cuisine. Once done, walk to the opposite direction to the entrance of the Grand Palace. The Grand Palace is vast. It is not a singular building but a complex of structures, pavilions, and courtyards. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha is one of the many quarters of the palace. Other notable sites inside are the Phra Maha Monthien Buildings, the Chakri Maha Prasat Buildings, and the Phra Maha Prasat Buildings. There are plenty of signs so just follow them. Prasat Phra Thep Bidon (The Royal Pantheon) was originally built in 1855 to house the Emerald Buddha but was later dropped because it was too small for such an honor. Images of garuda (mythical bird-like creatures) wrap Phra Ubosot, the temple’s main building. Each garuda holds a naga, a snake deity. Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat, the palace’s central court, combines traditional Thai with 19th century European architectures. Since its construction in 1782, it has been where the King of Thailand resides. However, King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), the current king, stays at Chitralada Palace. After you’ve had enough of the grandeur of the palace, time to move on and walk back to Tha Chang (N9) pier. Grand Palace Opening hours: 8:30am-3:30pm Entrance fee: THB 500   5. Siriraj Forensic Museum Once at Tha Chang Pier, hop onto the ferry to Siriraj Pier (N10) or Tha Rot Fai Pier, both on the west side of the river. Walk a couple of blocks into the hospital complex. Follow the signs to Adulyadej Vikrom Building. The museum is on the second floor. It is quite hard to find and the area can get crowded especially during rush hour, but once you reach the hospital complex, just ask anyone who looks like they work or study there. Tell them you’re looking for the forensic museum and they’ll know. The reception area of the museum Also known as the Museum of Death, the Siriraj Medical Museum is a paradise for those into dark tourism. Operated by Siriraj Hospital, the first Western medical center in Thailand, it houses a huge collection of artifacts gathered in the 120 years of the hospital’s existence and service as a pioneer in the medical field in the country. These artifacts are showcased in six separate permanent exhibits inside the museum. One of the most notable “items” on display in the Forensic Pathology section is the mummified body of Si Ouey Sae Urng (Si Quey). Regarded by many as modern Thailand’s first serial killer, Si Quey was a cannibal who victimized children in the 1950s. He was executed and his remains have since been kept at the hospital. After your visit, trace your steps back to the pier and board the boat to Phra Arthit (N13). Siriraj Medical Museum  Opening hours: Monday-Saturday 9am-4pm Entrance fee: THB 200   6. Khao San Road Backpacking central is what Khao San Road is most known for. At night, the backpackers keep the street alive as they flood into the bars and restaurants that edge the road. It’s like a bigger and wilder night market. If you’re ready for dinner at this point, you’ll have a gazillion options here. Restaurants boast western and local cuisines while outside, crowds gather around stalls that offer the usual (barbeque) and the exotic (crickets). How to get here : Board the SkyTrain (Silom Line) to S6 Saphan Taksin Station, take Exit 2."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/07/bangkok-travel-guide/,thailand,"BANGKOK ON A BUDGET: Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary 2017 If Southeast Asia Backpacking is a college degree, Bangkok is your 101 course. Smack at the heart of Thailand, Bangkok is widely regarded as the epicenter of the backpacking culture in Southeast Asia. First of all, it is cheap, one of the cheapest travel hubs in the world. Many other destinations in ASEAN can be easily accessed from Bangkok: Vientiane is just a bus-ride away. Siem Reap can be reached within the day. Hence, the tired backpacking trail in the region often begins and ends here. If you think this backpacking thing is a game, Bangkok is Level 1. It only gets harder from here, but you wouldn’t even notice because Bangkok would subtly prepare you for it.       And on top of it all, it is also tourist-friendly. Locals are used to tourists, and scams notwithstanding, it is relatively safe. Truly, Bangkok is an ideal destination for first-time travelers. And my God, don’t get us started with the food. In 2012, we first visited Bangkok as part of a longer backpacking journey. We have returned three times since, and it’s mostly because of its cuisine!   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Bangkok: Asia’s Backpacking Capital When to Visit Bangkok How to Get to Bangkok Where to Stay in Bangkok How to Stay Connected in Bangkok How to Get Around Bangkok Places to Visit in Bangkok Day Tours from Bangkok Sample Itineraries Budget Breakdown Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Bangkok: Asia’s Backpacking Capital My partner Vins with our friend Grace The capital of Thailand, Bangkok is the commercial, economic, and political center of the country. It is a wild, highly developed third-world metropolis but is still very much in touch with its past. Bangkok’s history as the Thai capital began in 1782, when King Rama I had the people move south following the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767. Bangkok lies at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River, seen as a very strategic military location back then. It was also King Rama I who ordered the construction of the Grand Palace complex and many other temples, which remain standing until today. Here are a few more facts you need to know: Language : Thai. Their language can be quite daunting to non-native speakers, especially its lengthy words and tongue-twisting pronunciations, but as with every other language, it only intimidates in the beginning. English isn’t widely spoken, but what the locals lack in English fluency, they make up for with their friendly attitude toward tourists. Currency : Thai Baht (THB, ฿). THB100 is roughly USD 2.95, EUR 2.58, PHP 149 (as of July 2017). There are a lot of money changers around the city, but most of them have poor rates, especially those at the airport. Trust me. I made that mistake and lost a lot in the conversion. If you really need to do so at the airport, exchange only a little and just find a SuperRich Thailand branch when you get to the city. SuperRich has the best rates. Modes of payment : Cash. Although some restaurants and hotels accept credit cards, smaller establishments prefer cash. Electricity Info : 220V. The most common socket type accepts both two flat or two round pronged type.   When to Visit Bangkok Bangkok could’ve been a year-round destination if it weren’t for the bouts of rain and flooding problems, which is why it is best to avoid the wettest months. Graph from the World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal Rainy season is from May to October, but the wettest months are September-October. We have tried traveling to Bangkok in January, July, September, and October, and we can tell you that the precipitation level can definitely affect your overall travel experience. We’ve been stranded in some sites because of torrential rains and flooding and ended up wasting much of our time. The peak season , which has the pleasant weather, begins in November and ends in April, during Songkran Festival (Thai New Year, April 13-15). But yes, prepare to share the city with millions of other tourists.   How to Get to Bangkok Bangkok is one of the busiest and most connected cities in the world. If you’re living in a major city, chances are, there’s a direct flight from where you are to Bangkok. The city is served by two airports: Don Muang Airport, which was the main airport until 2006, and the new Suvarnabhumi Airport, which is now the primary gateway, used by all Thai airlines except AirAsia, Nok Air, and Orient Thai. If you’re coming from Manila, you’re most likely using Suvarnabhumi Airport.   From Manila If you’re flying from Manila, the most cost-efficient nonstop options are Cebu Pacific Air and Philippine Airlines. Cebu Pacific has lower base fares, but note that Philippine Airlines already has 30kg check-in baggage allowance and other add-ons included in their published rates. Cebu Pacific’s standard rates include 20kg baggage allowance. Here are sample roundtrip rates: However, it’s not uncommon to find roundtrip fares for less than P5000 during seat sale!   From Singapore Scoot, Tiger Airways, and AirAsia offer the cheapest flights to Bangkok from Singapore.   From Kuala Lumpur If coming from Kuala Lumpur, your best bets are AirAsia, Malindo Air, and Malaysia Airlines.   How to Get from Suvarnabhumi Airport Airport to Bangkok City Center Suvarnabhumi Airport is situated 30km from the city center and can take 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on traffic. The two most popular ways to get to the city center are via Airport Rail Link + BTS and by taxi. BY AIRPORT RAIL LINK This is the fastest way to get to the city proper because you’ll be dodging Bangkok’s infamous traffic jams. You can find the station at the basement of the airport’s passenger terminal. There’s a train every 15 minutes from 6am to 12 midnight. It’s connected to the city’s BTS Skytrain at two stations: Makkasan (฿35) and Phayathai (฿45), the last station. The journey takes around 25 minutes. If you’re staying in Silom area , you can connect at either station. The Makkasan connection will take longer but is easier because there’s only one transfer involved. At Makkasan Station, just switch to the MRT Blue Line (bound for Hua Lumpong) at Petchaburi Station and alight at Silom Station. The Phayathai connection requires two transfers to get to Silom. At Phayathai, transfer to BTS Sukhumvit Line (bound for Bearing) and get off at Siam Station. Switch to BTS Silom Line (bound for Bang Wa) and alight at Saladaeng Station. If you’re staying in Khao San , you can get off at any station and just take a taxi. Fare shouldn’t exceed ฿60.   BY TAXI Don’t be too scared to take a cab. They’re still cheap by international standards, although you must always insist on using the meter. At the airport, follow the signs that reads Public Taxi. They’re aplenty. They will lead you to the first floor of the airport (below the Arrivals floor). this is where you’ll find ordinary metered taxis. Just fall in line and when you reach the desk, tell the staff your destination. You will be given a ticket with two copies: one for the driver, one for yourself. You will be charged a ฿50 surcharge on top of the meter. If the traffic isn’t so bad :Travel time: around 30-40 minutesFare: ฿250 + ฿50 surcharge + toll If traffic is normal (which is bad, lol):Travel time: around 45 minutes to hoursFare: ฿300-$350 + ฿50 surcharge + toll Expressway tolls are at ฿50 and ฿25. The ฿50 surcharge is PER RIDE, not per person.   Where to Stay in Bangkok For budget travelers, Khao San Road and Silom Road offer the cheapest accommodations. Khao San is the backpacking center and has a very festive vibe with lots of street food, restaurants, and bars. Its popularity among travelers also triggered the mushrooming of scams here. There is no train station around. Silom is the business and financial district of Bangkok. There are malls, shops, and night markets in its inner alleys. The famous (or infamous, depending on how you look at it and what you intend to do, haha) Pat Pong is also located around the corner. The best part is that it has its own train station that links it to rest of the city. I was able to try three budget hotels in Silom: Sunflower Silom Place, Nantra Hotel, and Smile Society.

You’ll find many pocket wifi rental booths around Bangkok, but if you want to stay connected from the get-go, you can reserve one in advance via Klook and just pick it up at the airport. Klook’s 4G Pocket Wifi provides hi-speed internet provided by AIS that can be used anywhere in Thailand. Connect up to 10 devices at once, which is great if you’re traveling with a group because you could just split the cost.

Klook’s Local 3G/4G SIM card allows internet connection anywhere in Thailand. Pick up at Suvarnabhumi Airport or Don Muang Airport. Unlimited data for 7 days anywhere in Thailand (64kbps after the first 2.5GB) Inclusive of THB100 call credits Reserve Here   __________ How to Get Around Bangkok The Thais have their own address system and first timers in Bangkok can be easily disoriented. Wikitravel explains it really well: “Large roads such as Silom or Sukhumvit are thanon while the side streets branching off from them are called soi. Sois are numbered, with even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other side. Thus, an address like 25 Sukhumvit Soi 3 means house number 25 on the 3rd soi of Sukhumvit Road.” Although it is not as sweat-free as in Hong Kong or Singapore, commuting in Bangkok is quite easy. Vehicular traffic can get crazy during rush hour though. But you’re used to the giant parking lot that runs across Manila called EDSA, you’ll be fine in Bangkok (or any other Southeast Asian city for that matter). Getting around via public transportation means using one or more of these four modes: Train (BTS Skytrain/MRT) . Bangkok’s train system is fast and reliable, and will take you to many attractions throughout the city. I found myself taking the train most of the time during my stay because there was a train station very near my hotel. Also, even during the busiest hours, I never experienced getting almost squished to death. The BTS fare ranges from 15 to 52 baht. And you will need 5 or 10 baht coins to get in. Most stations have a counter than can break your large bills and a ticket machine that accepts bills. Boat . The two boat services operating in Bangkok are the Chao Phraya Express Boat, which plies up and down the Chao Phraya River and is popular among tourists for it stops at many of the city’s most popular landmarks; and the Saen Saep Express Boat, used mostly by locals who commute to work. The Chao Phraya boat is the best option for you if you intend to visit the Grand Palace complex (at Tha Chang) and Wat Pho (at Tha Tien), and the Siriraj Medical Museum (Wang Lang Station) within one day! Taxi . Always my last option. If my destination is too far from a train or boat station, I would just hail a cab. A ride costs more than in Manila but nowhere near the rates in Hong Kong or Singapore. The flagdown is 35 baht and the average ride within the city is probably around 100. You might encounter cab drivers who take advantage of tourists by not using the meter and then overcharging. If the driver refuses to use the meter, just get off the vehicle. Know that all cabs in Bangkok must use the meter. Many of these drivers wait for tourist passengers at the popular attractions like temples and Khao San Road. I always walked far from them and just hail a moving cab. Tuktuk. I didn’t even bother. They are very expensive, even more expensive than cabs, and many of them (not all, but it’s hard to know) are involved in scams. If you really want to try for the heck of it, just agree on the price first.   Places to Visit in Bangkok If you’re fit and you enjoy walking, you’ll be glad to know that many of the city’s key attractions are located within walking distance of each other. For example, Bangkok’s most popular temples and shrines, Chinatown, and even Siriraj Forensic Museum are easily accessible from the Chao Phraya River and can be easily visited in one day. Here’s a quick do-it-yourself walking tour that will take you to the most popular sites in Bangkok: 6 Popular Attractions in Bangkok, A Walking Tour Same with Platinum Shopping Mall, Siam Square, and even the Goddess Tuptim Shrine.   Warning: Bangkok is notorious for scams targeted at tourists so always be careful. Some are actually more organized than they appear. One of the most widespread modus operandi involves people loitering by the gate of temples (or other tourist spot) and approaching tourists. They are very friendly, and they usually introduce themselves as teachers. They claim that the site you’re about to visit is closed because it is a holiday and that they know a more beautiful place that is not on tourist maps. They then hail a random tuktuk (which isn’t random at all for the driver is part of the scam) and tour you around. You will be taken to a jewelry store selling overpriced gems and accessories. The tuktuk may also overcharge you for the ride.   Grand Palace Opening hours : 8:30am-3:30pmEntrance fee : ฿500 The Grand Palace is vast.

It is what it is — a shopping and entertainment district. Yet, if you think about it, it somehow represents a generation — a younger, more industrialized, more fashionable Bangkok. Catering mostly to college students and young adults, Siam Square comprises several blocks harbors a wide array of stores — over a hundred of ’em — apparel stalls, boutiques, bookshops, record stores, restaurants, cafes, even cinemas. How to get here : Just take the BTS Skytrain System and get off at Siam Station. More info : Siam Square  _______________ Other Attractions: Chatuchak Weekend Market . A labyrinth made of shops, once popular only to wholesale traders but eventually became a favorite attraction among tourists. Here you’ll find almost anything you can think of: from souvenirs to flowers to clothes to furniture. Nearest BTS Station: Mo Chit Station, take exit 1. Bangkok Chinatown . Popular for its shops, especially near Charoenkrung Road. But there are also temples around the district. To be honest, if you’ve been to other Chinatowns in other parts of Southeast Asia, this one might disappoint you, unless you visit during the Chinese New Year, when the district really comes to life. How to get there: Take the Skytrain to S6 Saphan Taksin Station (BTS Silom Line), take Exit 2, and walk to the boat terminal. Buy a ticket and board a Chao Phraya Express Boat. Alight at the Ratchawong Pier (N5) and make your way on foot from Ratchawong Road to Sampeng Lane and Yaowarat Road.  _______________ Day Tours from Bangkok Many of these can be done DIY, too! But if you’re after convenience and better appreciation and understanding of the place, you can also join a guided group tour to explore other parts of Bangkok and nearby provinces. Warning: Again, scams are rampant in Bangkok. If you really want to join a tour, make sure you’re booking with a legit agency. There are numerous fraudulent “tour operators” around the city. To be safe, you can ask the staff of the hotel you’re staying in for recommendations. You can also book with Klook in advance. Klook is totally safe.

I stayed much longer, but if you have only an extended weekend to spend in Bangkok, here’s something to consider. Note that this assumes you’re flying in and out via Bangkok. OPTION 1: BANGKOK-AYUTTHAYA 4D3N ITINERARY Day 1 – Temples and Museums Wat Pho, Wat ArunGrand Palace Complex (including the Temple of the Emerald Buddha)Siriraj Medical MuseumKhao San Road or Pat Pong (for nightlife or shopping) Day 2 – Ayutthaya Day Tour Wat Yai ChaimongkonWat Phra Si SanphetWat MahathatWat Chaiwatthanaramand more wats! Day 3 – Food, Shopping, and Nightlife Damnoen Saduak Floating marketSiam Square, Platinum Square Day 4 Back to Manila If you follow this itinerary and you stay at a dorm, prepare to spend around ฿5100 ($150, P7600), excluding airfare. If you’re able to snag a P5000 roundtrip airfare from Manila, that places the total cost to only P12,600 . Bangkok is landlocked, so beach bums might get disappointed. But other Southeast Asian destinations are easy to reach from here. If you have more days, consider heading south to Phuket or Krabi or north to Chiang Mai or Pai. You may also cross borders to Vientiane, Laos or Siem Reap, Cambodia. Many of my friends (and I) have done the Bangkok-Siem Reap itinerary. Know that it entails spending a day on the road so make sure your time allows it. OPTION 2: BANGKOK-SIEM REAP 6D5N ITINERARY Day 1 – Bangkok Temples Wat Pho, Wat ArunGrand Palace Complex (including the Temple of the Emerald Buddha)Siriraj Medical MuseumKhao San Road or Pat Pong (for nightlife or shopping) Day 2 – Ayutthaya Day Tour Wat Yai ChaimongkonWat Phra Si SanphetWat MahathatWat Chaiwatthanaramand more wats! Day 3 – Bangkok Food and Shopping Damnoen Saduak Floating marketSiam Square, Platinum Square Day 4 – Land Travel to Siem Reap Day 5 – Angkor! Angkor WatBayon (Angkor Thom)Ta PhromAngkor Night MarketPub Street Day 6 – City Tour Plus Angkor MuseumLate night flight back to Manila This itinerary will set you back ฿8080 ($240, P12,000) excluding the airfare and assuming you’re staying at a dorm.   Budget Breakdown Below is the list of the usual prices of things you will need for a comfortable budget stay in Bangkok! Bear in mind that the figures are in Thai Baht. Meal (street food) – Pad thai costs around ฿40, pork rice ฿50,  and a big, big bowl of tom yum noodles ฿100. If you’re eating at restaurants, prepare to shell out at least ฿120. Accommodations – Dormitory beds from ฿100, hostel private room from ฿300, and a budget hotel room for two from ฿800 Grand Palace entrance fee – ฿500 Wat Pho entrance fee – ฿100 Wat Arun entrance fee – ฿50 Siriraj Medical Museum fee – ฿200 Damnoen Saduak Floating Market Tour – ฿400-720, depending on what’s included in the tour Ayutthaya Day Tour – doing it DIY-style may cost at least THB 700 but this only includes the visit to the temples. You’ll spend more if you drop by the floating markets too. Arranged tours cost around ฿1000 if visiting the temples only. It can cost up to ฿1400 if a sunset boat ride and a visit to the floating markets are included. Taxi – flagdown rate is THB 35, usual ride within the city is around THB 100 Train ride – THB 15-52."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2013/05/where-to-stay-in-bangkok-natra-silom-hotel-and-sunflower-place/,thailand,"Where to Stay in Bangkok: 3 Budget Hotels in Silom It was a toss between Khao San Road and Silom, but my friend Bebs, who had been living in Bangkok for months already, already picked for the two of us. Khao San Road, the city’s backpacking hub, is the usual choice for travelers seeking budget accommodations. Bebs, however, favored Silom, Bangkok’s business district, for its location and the convenience of the train (Silom Line) that connects it to the rest of the metropolis. Many of the major tourist spots in Bangkok are accessible via the MRT or BTS; Khao San Road usually requires a cab ride.       Silom was built in 1851 as part of a dyke. Today, however, it is Bangkok’s major financial center, harboring some of the country’s biggest corporations. At night, the suits and ties make way for a vibrant nightlife that consists of clubs and lounges tucked in its sois, and night markets that spring up along its stemming lanes. ATMs, money changers, convenience stores, and a wide array of restaurants flank its streets. The notorious  Pat Pong  is just around the corner. Silom became my home as part of my backpacking trip across the Southeast Asian peninsula. I was able to stay in three different budget hotels and hostels: Nantra Silom Hotel , Sunflower Place , and Smile Society . WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? Nantra Silom Hotel The Sunflower Place Smile Society Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts Nantra Silom Hotel Although only about 10 minutes from the Saladaeng BTS Station, Nantra Silom Hotel is quite difficult to find because it stands on an inner alley. (It took me quite a long time to finally find this place but maybe that’s just me.) But once you reach the place, it will be worth it. The interior gave a “new and clean” feel (maybe because it was new and clean? Lol) and their 24-hour front desk staff greeted us with a smile. The reception and common areas looked homey yet very modern and elegant. The twin room we booked was spacious and well-lit, and was equipped with cable TV and free wi-fi connection. Photo by Nantra Silom My friend Bebs swimming under the blanket Nantra Silom Hotel Toilet an Bath corner In one corner was the bathroom — and when I say corner, I mean corner. A shower curtain separates the toilet and bath from the rest of the room, which I found awfully uncomfortable. It was squeaky clean but I was just not fine with the idea of my roommate hearing (and smelling) my activities in it. Other than that, it was a delightful stay. Nantra Silom Hotel 130/8-12 Soi 8 Silom Road, Suriwong, Silom, 10510 Bangkok +66 2 634 2441   The Sunflower Place It was the bathroom that actually led me to search for another budget hotel. Off to Hostelworld I went and found another boasting dazzling reviews — the Sunflower Place. Thankfully, it is located just behind Nantra Silom, a little deeper into the wild block. Unlike the streamlined and minimalist aesthetic of Nantra Silom, the Sunflower Place is vibrant and warm. The twin room assigned to us (which I got for THB 890) was big and very comfortable, although I still prefer the fresher, more modern style of Nantra. It had a bathroom, a real one, and it was spacious, too. Sunflower Place Sunflower Place Twin Room Tours offered at Sunflower Place One touch that I greatly appreciated about the Sunflower Place was the ample signs about tourist-directed scams. They were posted on the lobby and inside the elevator. I wouldn’t have known about these scams had I not seen the posters. True enough, I would encounter these scammers as I roamed around the city and at the time, I knew exactly that I should avoid them. The Sunflower Place 39/17-19 Soi Anuman-Rajdhon, Surawong Road, Bangrak, Bangkok 10500, Thailand +662-235-9080   Smile Society Not too far from Nantra Silom and Sunflower Place is Smile Society. I stayed here in my most recent trip to Bangkok (July 2014). I have to say, of the three, Smile has the most “backpacker” vibe. There are cozy but still comfortable common areas where guests could get to know one another. It was World Cup during my stay and everyone gathered in front of the TV every night. I booked a triple room (for I was with two friends this time around) and it was tidy and pleasant. The best part: the owner was incredibly helpful. From the most trusted money changers to wholesome clubs, she knew in which direction to point us and was always happy to assist. I was HOURS too early for checkin but she still accommodated me. The only weird thing I encountered during my stay was that photography was prohibited. I never knew why, but I just followed. Hence, I have no photos of the place. Smile Society 130/3-4, Silom Soi 6, Silom Road, Bangrak, Bangkok 10500, Thailand"https://hippie-inheels.com/krabi-budget-guide/,thailand,"Majestic karst mountains, idyllic islands, and shorelines for miles. It’s a magical getaway. The Krabi region, in Thailand, provides exactly this, so there’s no surprise it’s a hot spot. It’s a world famous climbing destination right on the coast, sprinkled with gorgeous islands. Yeah, who wouldn’t want to vacation here? I’m so lucky, to have called this place home for a little over a year. It’s a place I always come back to. Krabi Budget Guide | spend less than 30 bucks a day Often times the popular spots can totally bust your backpacker budget. If you shop around and take away some information from this article you should be set with $30 or less a day. Of course depending on your spending habits, this may or may not work for you. If you’re an avid diver, a five cocktail minimum per night person, or a shopaholic, I’d suggest scrounging up some more money before heading over. If you’re a modest spender, you can go pretty far with $30. Check out how in Krabi’s hottest spots to wander to… (prices in USD) Krabi Town and Around Skip around the quiet town for a bit, and you’ll notice there isn’t too much do. There are a few markets which are all fantastic, but the real stuff is on the outside. Phanom Bencha National Park offers a viewpoint, hiking, and waterfalls, and Tup Kaek is one of my favorite places on earth! The hike is relatively easy and the views are unmatched. The Emerald pool would be nice if everyone and their mom didn’t go to it, but you still might find it of interest, and if there happens to be a cool morning in your future, a dip in the hot springs is a fantastic idea! Accommodation: Blue Juice and Good Dream are $5+. Less than 30 bucks a day on the Andaman Coast! Railay and Tonsai on a budget These two spots, especially Tonsai, I hold near and dear to my heart. They are simply gorgeous locations that offer tourists delightful views along with a castaway feel. These mainland beaches feel like a world of their own. You must get here by boat, giving you the feeling you’re on an island. Beach bumming is the main activity, but it also happens to play host to phenomenal world-class rock climbing. So try your hand at that. Many choose to stay on Railay which is more developed (and pricer), but my personal choice is Tonsai. It’s a lot more laid back here. It cost $3 to get here by boat from Ao Nang. Accommodation: Rampala on Railay is $10+. I never EVER can remember the place I stay at on Tonsai. It’s around $10 depending on the season. Tonsai is another world, you’ll know what I mean if you go. Names aren’t important while you’re here. Koh Phi Phi on a budget Koh Phi Phi is the quintessential spot to go to in Krabi. Buckets, snorkeling trips to the famous Maya Bay, and beach parties. You might burst your budget here if you’re not careful. This might be the most expensive spot on this list. Accommodation: Places go for $10+. Koh Lanta on a budget Escaping to lonely beaches, partying on Long Beach, snorkel trips, chilling out, and more. Accommodation: White Flower on Long Beach goes for $12+. Ao Nang on a budget This is the popular mainland beach to hang out at. You can also chill here if you’re headed to Tonsai, Railay, or on a snorkel trip. Accommodation: Yellow Sun is about $6+. Getting some grub | budget eats in Krabi Food will be cheap, if you eat local. Should you be someone who doesn’t fancy market food or food from vendors that appear to be selling food just outside their home (because they probably are) you’re going to drain your budget. There are a plethora of markets to chow down at for super cheap. Budget $10, and this on the high end.  I spend, on average, $7 per day for three meals. I usually have a western style breakfast and a local dish for lunch and dinner. You can spend as little as $4 on food a day if you eat the cheapest local food around. Other Expenses in Krabi: Motorbike rental – $6 for a 24 hour rental. Full tank – $2 National Park entrance fees – $5-10 Songthaew (public taxi) – $1-2+ depending where you’re headed. Rock climbing with gear and guide- $30 Four island snorkeling trip – $13-$15 As you may have noticed, you can also spend a lot less than $30 a day. If you are just hanging out for a few days with no plans but sticking your toes in the sand, you’d be fine to get by with $15-20 for a room and food. After a few days like that, maybe busting your budget one day for climbing or diving would be well justified. Last minute thought, keep in mind the season you’re coming in at as well. High season will hike the cost up. There’s one thing that’s for sure, there’s no going wrong with traveling around the Krabi region. It’s popular for a reason. It’s freaking gorgeous!"https://hippie-inheels.com/where-to-stay-in-bangkok/,thailand,"Where to Stay in Bangkok On my way to and from the Thai Islands, I stayed in Bangkok. I, unfortunately, didn’t do any research on where to stay. This worked out well on the islands, but unless you are staying on Khao San road, you should book a place in Bangkok ahead of time. A very large modern city; although, not overwhelming to a seasoned traveler, you really do need to know where to stay in Bangkok to have the best time. It has a very western feel to it during the day, while at night is a different world ! It is easy to get around thanks to the sky train and taxis. I stayed in 3 very different areas that each has their own pros and cons . (These are not the only areas worth staying, just the ones we chose.)  Area 1- the hostel Upon initial arrival, 2 friends and I spent 2 nights at Lub D Siam Square Bangkok .  This was a bit too far from the attractions we hoped to see in Bangkok, although, it was near the MBK center . This is a huge mall with market-like shops. If I had come from the states, I wouldn’t have been too interested. But having come from India, I was so excited to see such western things: the food, shopping and air conditioning. On the other hand, my friends had come from California, and they were ready for street food! I literally could have just chilled at the hostel and spent my days at the mall eating soft pretzels from Auntie Anne’s. Click here for rates and availability. The hostel itself was overpriced , charged for each little thing, and offered tours that were not at a very good rate compared to what could be gotten at Khao San road. Also, the man with the maps to help us out with “anything” couldn’t book bus tickets, which you get a good price on in Khao San road at any travel agency.  For night 3, we did end up switching hotels to be closer to the “backpacking scene”. We had wasted a bit of money on transportation. Keep in mind, you can’t walk all over Bangkok, it’s a good idea to hire a driver for the day , instead of paying each small distance you go. Area 2- Khaosan Road So we took the sky train (I love cities with great transport!) to Khao San (Khaosan) Road . This is described in “The Beach” as all the backpackers trying to be cool, etc. I found it to be a nice mix. A nice professional looking guy, pale as can be, because probably just arriving in Thailand would sit down and get his whole head dreaded, buy a tie dye shirt, and he’s a brand new person. It’s neat that you can re-invent yourself, but, it is the type of environment that makes me personally want to get out… it was congested. eating a scorpion! The guesthouses we checked out all seemed pretty similar in price, much cheaper than near MBK. Some have pools they let non-guests hang out at . I didn’t see food as cheap as Khao San road once we got to the islands. This was also the best deal I saw on jewelry , although most pieces here were unoriginal. The islands were expensive; for me Koh Samui was where I did the most shopping at good prices. I hardly shopped at all on Koh Lanta, the most laid back of the islands . Khao San road is good for the consumer (aka me!)I brought hardly anything to Thailand and shopped quite a bit for jean shorts, crop tops, and all things crochet and feathered! It’s also a good place to drink, party, and set up tours to any sightseeing activities you want to do- at a good rate. But the best perk of all- the cheap massages! Priced lower than the islands, why not get one everyday?   Shopping &amp; nightlife on Khaosan Road Area 3- Sukhumvit When I left through Bangkok, a month later, my boyfriend and I were meeting up with some friends from India in a swanky area called Sukhumvit. Our driver said “oh, so so special, sukhumvit!” when we told him where to take us. Then he charged us three times what the meter said *sigh. Roads are named by number, as in: Sukhumvit Soi 1, Sukhumvit Soi 2, etc. We went to the Park Plaza on Sukhumvit Soi 18 . I am not high-class, but this area was my favorite by far. Although, the side streets had locals serving street food, there weren’t as many tourists, and everything moved a little slower. It almost seemed private. I was near a large shopping center, as well as amazing restaurants. I am not the best at eating local. Because of living in India, I miss a lot of western foods. I ate Burger King and McDonalds in Thailand about 5 times in the month I was there. I don’t regret it at all! In Sukhumvit, we ate at an Argentinian steakhouse and sipped our drinks with friends until it was time to fly back to Bombay. Overall, if you are backpacking there is really just no reason not to stay on Khao San road. Everything is accessible from there. Food, shopping, and booze are cheap. Many agencies offer tours to floating markets and temples at better prices than a taxi would be. If you are in Bangkok for luxury, stay far away from Khao San road."https://hippie-inheels.com/koh-phi-phi-travel-tips/,thailand,"7 Ways to Screw up Koh Phi Phi Did you think Koh Phi Phi was overrated? It’s a gorgeous island but if you don’t get away from the main bars and beach, you might not see some of the best places and will leave with a bad taste in your mouth. Here are 7 ways to screw up Koh Phi Phi. Try not to do them and use the Koh Phi Phi travel tips below instead!  Ko Phi Phi Travel Tips – 7 Ways to Screw it up 1. Having High Expectations. Ko Phi Phi is packed to the brim with what looks like 18-year-old kids chugging 400 baht buckets having a Spring Break style party. You don’t want to have expectations beyond laying out, maybe some hiking, and partying. There are some quieter beaches to visit and you could avoid all of the parties, but it is sort of the “thing to do”here. the incoming ferry  What you should do instead: have realistic expectations . The sea water isn’t that clean these days, there isn’t a lot of lodging compared to amount of people, you’re going to spend double your budget, and the island is so small that you’ll fall asleep to the techno/dub music lullaby of the island. Also, buy your buckets on the street, not at a bar. Like college, you need to pregame or go for the bucket deal: Buy 2 get one free and let each person have their own bucket. It is an awesome place to let loose and party, so expect that this will be one wildly fun, budget-unfriendly time. you’ll get this if you just take a 20-minute hike 2. Not getting off the main party strip of Ko Phi Phi Don. It’s a small, crowded beach. Yes, it’s gorgeous in a panoramic view; but up close the partying remnants from the night before are floating in the water along with pieces of old long-tail boats. There is another beach that is full of boats that you can’t go on, and then you have the side with the huge new pier. It’s a small island; you’re pretty limited on where to go. Check out my post on Koh Lanta , a place that I found beaches just to have to myself! main beach- when the tide goes out, the beach doubles in size the long-tail boat beach; you can’t swim here Instead, take the 20-minute hike to Long Beach . It’ll still have a few groups of people, and if you’re unlucky it might be overly crowded, but it’s still better than the main beach. The hike is gorgeous and the water is clean and deep! You can actually stay on that side of the beach. I think for more than two days you’d get bored, as all the shopping and most popular bars are on the other side. On the main beach, you can rent a kayak for 100 baht per person. If you want to get to the “open water” via kayak… well it’s harder than it looks to get out of the bay! Once you get out, you’ll see the water change to a darker, deeper color, you’ll remember Shark Bay isn’t far away and if you’re like me, you’ll paddle faster to get back to the bay. even hiking to beautiful Long Beach, the “gem”, you’ll see loads of trash 3. Getting massages near the beach. These are the worst Thai massages I’ve had and it cost two times more. I am actually a Thai yoga masseuse, and one part of giving a massage is focusing on that person. These women just chit-chat, don’t watch what they are doing and massage the same area for 10 minutes so that don’t have to move. save your massage money one day (300 baht), instead pay to use a pool &amp; sip on some fresh fruit juice Instead, get a massage as far inland as you can to a less crowded place . You’ll get more focused attention and a better price. The same usually goes for shopping, but I found an exception. A little place on the main strip (forget the name, tear) sells handmade leather jewelry. The guy running it is Thai and his helper is his English girlfriend. I got a hair wrap as well as a few armbands and a headband. They are my ultimate favorite pieces of jewelry right now and everyone asks where I get them!  They’re  shocked when I say touristy Phi Phi.   A little pricey but great quality. It’s just near Woody’s.  4. Getting a bad guesthouse. Ko Phi Phi is the most expensive of the islands, and Koh Phi Phi hotels match that. All of Thailand it’s true that booking online will sometimes be the higher price you can pay since you can’t negotiate. In person or even over the phone you will get a better rate but you risk there is no availability at the decent places. If you just roll up and negotiate with the Thai guys at the port, you’ll find somewhere decent at an okay price if there are open rooms. I usually NEVER deal with touts but I find that Ko Phi Phi is not the most fun place to wander and hunt for a room (because it’s hot and most rooms are full). So, I wouldn’t typically say this but you are better off asking the guys for your options. Then negotiate those prices. You’ll pay a fee to him ahead of time, which will be a portion of your first nights stay. Make sure you get a receipt. Don’t book too many nights in advance because if you stay longer, you can negotiate with the actual guesthouse owner. We stayed way uphill from the beach. I preferred this; it was a little quieter and we got a nice work out walking uphill two or three times a day. This was one of the more annoying places to find somewhere to stay so even though it’s a little more expensive it would have saved hassle to book online. Here are some great options we saw: Phi Phi Relax Beach Resort – cute bungalows, cheap Mama Beach Residence – Ao Ton Sai beach, yoga, chic Phi Phi Island Village Beach Resort – little more high end, pool, stunning views Zeavola Hotel Koh Phi Phi – if you want to live it up, the most luxurious stay You might also find something on airbnb which has great options all over the world. I have a discount code for you: $40 off your first stay if you  use this airbnb link to book .   You can actually sign up now and it will save the credit until your first booking even if its not one of the Koh Phi Phi islands hotels. 5. Not getting to Maya Bay. Some people come all the way to Ko Phi Phi and don’t see Maya Bay because it’s “too touristy”. You got all the way too overrated Phi Phi and drew the line at Maya Bay!? Come on! Just check it out. Go to Ko Phi Phi Ley: Maya Bay, but follow these 10 tips for Maya Bay , like taking a private boat and being prepared to get up the difficult rope climb if they go in the back way. I get a lot of emails asking me about a tour to Maya Bay (Ko Phi Phi Leh) from the main bit of Ko Phi Phi Don, and these are the best options: this tour with Viator  which includes lunch. If you want something cheap you can do this longtail boat for just $18 on getyourguide.com. 6. Jumping a Rope of Fire with the Fire Gods. The fire gods are what we dubbed the oiled up Thai guys that put on the all-night fire shows. If you’re un lucky the hunkiest of all will pull you up to hold you while he jumps rope- a giant rope on fire. Then you’ll catch your hair on fire. It will be traumatic. Your friend will do the same and burn her leg; she’ll have a scab for weeks after. It’s not fun. Be smart! Yes hair grows back and scabs go away, but I’ve heard worse stories that what happened to us. Understand that it’s real, hot, fire and even though it touches them and they don’t seem to care- it will burn and it will hurt. If you want to jump, keep your hair and a pony and do it when you’re not that drunk. You can also choose to do something a little less scary. You can jump through a hoop or just stand there while the Fire Gods spin the flames around you. They’ll pull up people near the front to participate so if you don’t want to be around it then sit back a couple rows. 7. Eating Beef at Breaker’s. This restaurant is geared toward tourists with its t.v.’s playing soccer and it’s menu like that of an American Bar. I eat beef in India all the time and wasn’t that worried about it- I guess in the last year of Indian life I’ve let my guard down a little. My friend and I shared the nachos… and I got a cheeseburger. Two hours later we were sweaty, puking all over the bathroom. It was disgusting. We were way uphill on the island, a 30-minute walk from the hospital. We both were dehydrated, but I was sicker than the time I got food poisoning from prawns in Goa. I went to the hospital at sunrise and told them I want an iv asap. As a nurse, I see the magic of a little fluid all the time and really just wanted to fast forward the process. Anna was sick at this point too and got an iv as well. We were better in an hour, but without fluid replacement, we would have suffered all day. The consequence was being on antibiotics for 5 days after (that I didn’t take because seriously if I did every time I got sick living in India and traveling in Asia, I’d be on them ALL the time). all my bikinis I wore in Thailand were Agua Bendita – the CUTEST bikinis, love them! Turn on your JavaScript to view content Instead, stick to Thai food or deep fried street food . I hadn’t thought about how far the beef has to travel to get the islands. Along with the common power outages, the meat can easily go bad. like the pizza, Ko Phi Phi was “Not the Best, but nice one” Ko Phi Phi does have some positives because we stayed for a week. Part of the lengthy stay in comparison to our stays at other Thai islands was because we were waiting on friends to meet us. If you go into this with realistic expectations, you can enjoy yourself; party all night, sleep all day. I had way too high of hopes for “The Beach” and I wasn’t in the mood to drink buckets with youngsters (did I mention I was there when England colleges had a huge school break?)"https://hippie-inheels.com/koh-lanta/,thailand,"Kicking Back on Koh Lanta Island Krabi’s beach buddy, Koh Lanta , was the only deserted beach I made it to in Thailand. I only wish I would have gone there last, so I would have appreciated it more! With stunning views along the Andaman coast, the almost empty guesthouse we chose was perfect to relax and recharge. Had I known what was in store on the other more crowded islands, I would have stayed here a little longer. Where I stayed We stayed at Lanta New Coconut , which was beautiful. Whenever you read a guidebook about Thailand it says under the budget rooms quotes like, “not much to the place, but cheap!” or “pretty simple, but didn’t cost much!” It’s so ridiculous, because these places are gorgeous! Yes, the roof is made from leaves, but that’s the beauty of staying in these beach huts. I love my luxuries, but I will always want to stay in a private room like this than a hotel, and definitely not a hostel! Our huts were right on the beach, lined up, and surrounded by gorgeous flora. The place had a swimming pool with lawn chairs, wi-fi, little kitchen and overpriced shop, and nice owners. The showers were cold like every other beach hut, but we did have A/C. This one cost me 8 USD/night. Getting there We booked an overnight bus on Khaosan Road , where we stayed in Bangkok, for 800 baht to Surat Thani. We had to drive across southern Thailand to Krabi’s Khlong Chilat pier, where we caught our 1.5 hour ferry on to Koh Lanta. We ended up paying another 300 to complete the trip. You can go straight from Bangkok to Krabi, but that was booked for us at the time. It is possible to go on to over-hyped Koh Phi Phi from Koh Lanta, which is what we did at the end of our stay on the island. Partying &amp; Food on Koh Lanta Our guesthouse was just down a path from the main road. We got lunches and dinner at a local Thai place up the street. There was an art gallery nearby and a 7-11 as there always is. The island offers a Marine National park, but we chose to read by the beach and recover from our Bangkok nights . The hotel offered “The Four Islands Boat Tour” around the island to caves, but we were informed by another group that is was uneventful so we decided to save that money for future excursions. We had one non-thai dinner at the Greek Taverna. As far as Greek food goes, it wasn’t amazing, but if you’re looking for a break from the same food every day, it’s good enough to go for lunch and get a gyro. Partying on Koh Lanta was pretty dead while we were there. The island isn’t walkable , it’s the largest of 15 islands in the krabi area) so you have to get tuk tuks, which don’t run as late here as other places. The main party spot is Phra Ae/Long Beach to Galaxy Bar, Funky Monkey, Opium Bar, and Ozone Bar. We were in a pretty chill mood while on the island and instead of searching out for buckets, we went to a nearby beach bar. We obviously still ended up drinking buckets. This island is known for being more laid-back and also doesn’t have the sex tourism scene that you’ll see elsewhere. It surprised me how many Thai are Muslim, and Koh Lanta was the place in Thailand I saw more Islamic culture in dress, and people speaking arabic. early in the day, while the tide is in, you still can’t hardly swim because the rocks are right under While the water had these hidden we tried to swim out and got scraped up! ouch!   Tips for Koh Lanta Rent a scooter! Be braver than me! The land is very hilly in some areas, but the roads are wide and paved, the perfect place to learn. Always remember to take time-stamped photos of the bike before and let the renter know of any previous scratches so you don’t get scammed. The hospital on the island is not equipped for emergencies, so don’t go overdosing on drugs or anything else stupid! The west coast is where most tourists stay, on the beach, but the east coast is the lush location of Old Town If you do take the Four Islands Tour, make sure you include snorkling the Emerald Cave, I’ve heard from other travelers it’s the real deal, and a shame I missed it. November to April is High Season here (no rain). I went in September, so that’s why it was so quiet, luckily the rains were pretty much over. Sea gypsies have lived on Koh Lanta for hundreds of years, having come from Indonesia, and they should not be seen as a tourist attraction. If you’re on a super tight time frame and are interested in partying, skipping Koh Lanta might work for you."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/02/free-or-cheap-attractions-bangkok-thailand/,thailand,"10 Free or Cheap Things to Do in Bangkok, Thailand The most wonderful thing about Bangkok is that it has almost everything for everyone. It is a city that embraces its past and treasures its heritage. You can see it in their magnificent temples. You can taste it in their delicious and rich cuisine.

Do the usual Temple Run. Bangkok’s most popular tourist spots are its intricately designed and culturally significant Buddhist temples: Wat Arun, Wat Pho and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha (in the Grand Palace complex). Also called the Temple of Dawn, Wat Arun probably the most recognizable landmark in Bangkok. Wat Pho is home to the reclining Buddha. And the Grand Palace amazes with its ornate architecture. More about it here: Bangkok DIY Boat + Walking Tour Wat Pho Temple of Emerald Buddha 2. Cruise down the Chao Phraya River. The best way to explore Bangkok? Via a boat ride down the Chao Phraya, often called “The River of Kings.” It gives access not just to the temples, but also some lesser-known sites including the Royal Barges Museum, which shelters eight of Thailand’s most amazing barges. These barges can only be seen in action on very special occasions like the Royal Barges Procession. These teak wood barges are engraved with Thailand’s mythical creatures and are lined with gold strips. Inside the museum you’ll see a brief history of the procession, the royal uniforms of the officers and the old barges used back in the day. Royal Barges Museum is open daily from 9:00AM to 5:00PM. Narai Song Suban HM Rama IX and Suphannahong barges. The Narai Song Suban HM Rama IX barge. Its crew consisted of 50 oarsmen an 2 steersmen. Chao Phraya river vendor 3. Sample Bangkok’s Kerbside Cuisine. Thailand has arguably the most famous cuisine in Southeast Asia. From spicy soups like Tom Yum to sweet desserts like Mango Sticky Rice, Thailand’s popular dishes have made their way to dining tables across the globe. But in Bangkok, you can get great-tasting local food in the streets! More info: Bangkok’s Kerbside Cuisine Bangkok’s Kerbside Cuisine 4. Have a great meal at Krua Apsorn Located in Samsen Road, Krua Apsorn Restaurant is one of the most famous restaurants in Bangkok, serving delicious central and southern Thai dishes. Their best-sellers are their famous crab omelet, stir-fried crab with yellow chili, and water lily stems with shrimps. Finish your meal with a glass of Chānm yĕn or Thai iced milk tea. Krua Apsorn Crab Omelet Krua Apsorn Crab with Yellow Chili (right) Iced Milk Tea 5. Satisfy your curiosity at Siriraj Medical Museum. Also known as the Museum of Death, the Siriraj Medical Museum is a paradise for those into dark tourism. Operated by Siriraj Hospital, the first Western medical center in Thailand, it keeps a huge collection of artifacts gathered in the 120 years of the hospital’s existence and service as a pioneer in the medical field in the country. These artifacts are showcased in six separate permanent exhibits inside the museum. Related Post: Bangkok Travel Guide &amp; Itinerary One of the most notable “items” on display in the Forensic Pathology section is the mummified body of Si Ouey Sae Urng (Si Quey). Regarded by many as modern Thailand’s first serial killer, Si Quey was a cannibal who victimized children in the 1950s. He was executed and his remains have since been kept at the hospital. A quick Google search 6. Explore Asiatique Riverfront. The Asiatique Riverfront is a night bazaar and a mall. It used to be old port warehouses that were converted to 1500 boutiques and 40 restaurants. You can find everything you need here. Whether you’re into muay thai or ladyboy cabaret shows, you’ll find something to enjoy here. The place has 4 categorized warehouses: The Chareonkrung District, where you can find the small boutiques and souvenir shops. Waterfront District, where high-end restaurants are located. Factory District, which harbors designer fashion brands and gadget stores (iStudio apple product re-seller). Town Square District, which is made up of bars and event venues. Asiatique The Riverfront district Asiatique Factory District North Eastern Thai Cuisine restaurant in Asiatique The Riverfront Warehouse 6 With Ricky Lo of The Philippine Star and Pam Pastor of Inquirer in Asiatique The Riverfront Warehouse 6 7. Indulge in the Backpacking Culture in Khao San Road. Backpacking central is what Khao San Road is most known for. At night, the backpackers keep the street alive as they flood into the bars and restaurants that edge the road. It’s like a bigger and wilder night market. If you’re ready for dinner at this point, you’ll have a gazillion options here. Restaurants boast western and local cuisines while outside, crowds gather around stalls that offer the usual (barbeque) and the exotic (crickets). 8. Visit the Phallus Shrine. Chao Mae Tuptim Shrine, simply Tuptim Shrine or more colloquially P*nis Shrine, is situated at the Swissotel Nai Lert Park. People have left thousands of wooden phalluses as offerings to Goddess Tuptim. “Confronted by the extraordinary display the shrine has automatically been concluded to be dedicated to fertility,” reads the sign by the entrance to the site. Read more: Goddess Tuptim Shrine Goddess Tuptim Shrine 9. See Bangkok Chinatown. Chinatown is popular for its shops, especially near Charoenkrung Road. But there are also temples around the district. To be honest, if you’ve been to other Chinatowns in other parts of Southeast Asia, this one might disappoint you, unless you visit during the Chinese New Year, when the district really comes to life. Bangkok Chinatown 10. Shop at Chatuchak Market. Any visit to Thailand is incomplete without a little bit (or a lot) of shopping. Malls like MBK, Siam Paragon and Platinum are the usual favorites. But Chatuchak Weekend Market has its own charm. Its sheer size alone is noteworthy, spanning 35 acres and housing over 8000 stalls. Even the crowd can be overwhelming as it welcomes around 200,000 visitors per weekend."https://hippie-inheels.com/my-little-guide-to-istanbul/,turkey,"My Little Guide to Istanbul The Basics of Istanbul There are cats everywhere! lol that’s the first thing to know. They are super cute, fluffy, and everyone feeds and play with them! Getting to and from Istanbul By air, there are two airports in the city and one is quite far out. Istanbul Atatürk Airport (IST), on the European side of the city and Sabiha Gökçen International Airport on the Asian side of the city. The Bosphorus strait separates the two and traffic can be tough. Check out my guide on how to get around in Istanbul and which areas are best to stay in Istanbul (complete with a pinned map). Most people would agree Ataturk is the best airport to fly in and out of. For airport information all over the world you can download Gate Guru ( iPhone and Android ) to see what stores and food at at your terminal. The other options are train and even boat! Transportation In Istanbul I wrote about this pretty heavily in my guide how to get around Istanbul , but as a recap you should download Uber ( iPhone and Android ). It was the bomb. It was way cheaper than taxis off the street. I also used a very reliable service called Blacklane twice for a very reliable service which was a little more pricey but I knew they weren’t going to cancel. The tram and metro were a breeze to get around and the ferries easily take you from European side to Asian side. Water taxis are expensive though so be careful to avoid them! If you want to get around outside Istanbul, maybe people hire cars to go to Cappadocia .  SIM cards and WiFi in Istanbul I picked up a SIM at the airport as I was told that it’s very hard to get a SIM card in the city. It was very expensive compared to what I’ve paid even in London at 95 Lira for 2 GB ($32). I went with Turkcell and although it was overpriced in my opinion, it was great coverage and even for an internet obsessed blogger, 2 GB was enough for my time there. Another blogger Johnny used Alldaywifi  and I connected to it occasionally while we were at the World Tourism Forum and out around town. It’s 35 dollars for 7 days but the 3g connection is unlimited! Which is why Johnny didn’t mind having every blogger there connect to his device lol! It connects up to 10 devices. Where to Stay in Istanbul I listed all my favorite hotels in Istanbul in this Istanbul accommodation article . I stayed at two, visited two for the spa, and one for lunch. I researched all of these before my trip and had a hard time deciding which ones to stay at. I ended up at the  W Hotel  and  Hotel Ibrahim Pasha  ( hotel review here coming ). I loved them both although they were complete opposites of one another. I cannot wait to go back and stay at the other hotels on the list. I would say that my next top 3 on my wishlist would be:  Sumahan on the Water  on the Asian side where I had a fantastic lunch,  The House Hotel Galatasaray  famous for its views and unique rooms, and the  Pera Palace Hotel Jumeirah  if you really want to splurge out Sultan style. Spas in Istanbul Before I go on with this I want to make a side mention, there is a Toni and Guy Salon  in Istanbul if you need a good hair cut or color and have been traveling for ages! I tried to make time for it, but alas I was too busy. Turkish Baths Turkish baths are all the rage in Istanbul, and not just for tourism. They date back to the Victorian era and “hammams” were built next to mosques for a variety of reasons. Before you enter a mosque you should clean yourself and another reason was the money brought in from the hammam would help fund the mosque. Turkish women would go for a gossip session. What makes Turkish baths unique is that they do not have pools or baths in them (like you’ll see in Roman baths or in Budapest). I visited the top hammam in Istanbul, the Kilic Ali Pasa Hamami known as being the most luxurious bath in Istanbul that locals will go to so get the real experience. You are brought into a domed room made entirely of marble. There are a few star and moon cut-outs in the ceiling letting in natural light and water drips down, as the whole place was built to mimic a steam room. You really will get a bath, and yes everyone will be naked. It is not mixed gender! You will take a steam session by laying on a slab of marble in the middle until your bath. The bath is really cool. The lady will scrub you so hard that you can see dark skin coming off (there goes my tan!) and then you are completely covered in a pile of bubbles while you get bathed and have your hair washed. I recommend bringing your own comb to brush your hair out in the hammam as once it’s wrapped up in a towel and you get to the dressing room, mine was nearly impossible to brush out. The price at  Kilic Ali Pasa Hamami is 170 tl ($57 USD) which is a steal considering it’s a luxury hamami. You would be bonkers to not try this while in Istanbul! You cannot take photos inside so I don’t have any to share but you can see them on their website. Location of Kilic Ali Pasa Hamami:  Kemankes Mahallesi, Hamam Sokak 1, Trophane. +90 212 393 80 10. Other famous hamams include the oldest, Çemberlitaş Hamamı, and the one near the Hagia Sofia, Ayasofya Hurrem Sultan Hamam, among others. Modern Spa in Istanbul Although trying the traditional services was amazing, I also wanted to try out modern spa services in Turkey so when the most prestigious spa in Istanbul, the Raffles Hotel Spa , invited me to try their Heavenly treatment, I was there in a heartbeat. BONUS: get there early, because it is built right next to a really good mall,  Zorlu . My treatment was 2.5 hours long and I never wanted it to end. It started with choosing my oil fragrance, and a dry brush of my skin. It sounds strange, but in Turkey, they are really into getting all the old dead skin off and it’s really meant to keep you looking young. I have to admit it hurts a little; no pain, no gain. Next she rubbed on this warming lotion and I realized I had been laying on a space blanket… she wrapped me up like a burrito in saran wrap then put the heavy heated space blanket around me while I baked and lost some water weight! Next came the hour-long massage… and it ended with a facial! After all the sun and dirt my skin sees in Goa, I felt fresh as a daisy when I walked out of there. If you’re looking to splurge on this vacation, I highly recommend it. I have had so many spa treatments all over the world, and this was one of the best. The Must Do Tours in Istanbul Walks of Turkey Walks of Turkey offers two tours that I think would be of interest to you: the “best of Istanbul” tour and the “Istanbul in a day” tour. I went for the best of tour which was 3 hours instead of 9. If I could do it again, I would go for the 9 hour tour because the additional places in that tour I sadly never ended up seeing. When I travel Europe, as you’ll see in most of my European city posts, I love to take walking tours. You find out everything about the cities’ history that way that you would otherwise miss out on and it makes the places stick in your memory better. I still remember war stories that were told to me in Berlin in 2009! This tour was no different. The guy was spectacular and explained everything you’d want to know while visiting the Hagia Sofia, Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, and underground Basilica Cistern (which are the biggest tourist attractions in Istanbul). I would say this tour is worth every penny. The meeting place was outside the Blue Mosque, which was all of a 30 second walk from my Hotel,  Hotel Ibrahim Pasha . Istanbul in a Day , 9 hour tour, is $105 USD and includes lunch. Best of Istanbul , a 3 hour tour, is $52 USD. They both include entrance fees but you should tip. I have so many incredible photos from this tour which isn’t surprising since these sites are some of the most beautiful in the world, so I am going to share them as a best of Istanbul photo gallery in an additional post soon enough! Istanbulite I am obsessed with my  Istanbulite  tour! I met Eda, the young hip owner, at the World Tourism Forum and she asked if I wanted to take a tour. She does “bespoke tours” on top of all the options she has on her website. I knew right away what we should do together- a shopping tour. I told her I had already done a tour of the city with Walks of Turkey and really just wanted to see the trendy local designers. I told her I had a list of them already with locations and Instagrams! She thought it was great and already offered a shopping tour of sorts, so added in the ones I wanted to see and wa-la I had a tour guide take me to see all the places I thought would take me days to see (all in about 6 hours). The tour was fantastic, she knows everyone in town, and I would take another one of her tours in a heartbeat. This is honestly an incredible opportunity while you are in Turkey. Whenever TV shows film there (like Run-DMC’s show) they call on Eda. She’s the “it girl”! If you want to shop, she knows the places to get all the best things and as a local knows the best prices. You can reach her here:  Eda Sokmen, +90 537 346 60 20 email eda@istanbulite.com . She has tours all over Turkey. I have so much to share about the shopping tour, that I’m writing another post about it and will show you the shops we went to. Authentic Turkey Tours This is a great option if you’re reading this thinking “eh, I’m not really a tour person”. They will actually just take you out for a day on the town which can go in any direction you like- if you want to take photos, they will take you to the secret local spots (no joke, one was a stairwell of a falling apart old building with an old man taking money to let us pass… we ended up on a rooftop with the most beautiful view in the city). I did a bespoke tour with Authentic Turkey Tours and just explained that I didn’t want to see tourist attractions and I didn’t want to shop because I had those covered, but I wanted to see how the locals lived; what did they do in the evenings, where were the cool pubs… Where did people get a drink after work? Where did they have dinner? And of course I wanted to get great photos to share with you guys! They company is run by expats and they know what other foreigners want to see. They took me to Karaköy, which I guess I would describe as an area in Galata, or right outside it. It’s the new up and coming trendy place and all the 20 and 30 somethings were hanging out here. There was graffiti on the walls, amazing little boutique shops, and loads of pubs! They showed me the infamous (on Instagram) umbrella alley and we had a quick bite a few locals beers at Pim Karakoy. We went for a few  more  drinks at the exclusive Soho House (check that off the list!) where you can’t even take photos, because you know celebs could be there! The place used to be the American Embassy and it was just stunning. Then we had a late dinner at their favorite Turkish restaurant, Zubeyir Ocakbasi &amp; Restaurant. Thank god for Uber, because after a few brews I cannot be asked to sort myself through public transportation! lol Things to See in Istanbul (tourist attractions in Istanbul) The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Sunken Cistern, Hippodrome, and Topkapı Palace  are all right next to each other in  Sultanahmet.  You get off the tram at Sultanahmet stop and you cannot miss these places. If you want information, I recommend the tour I took but you can alternatively just wander around Them. You need to cover your head and pay entrance fees at most.  For great views you’ll want to take a ferry ride at some point on the Bosphorus which takes you from Europe to Asia when you cross. You can also go up the  Galata Tower and take photos of the city from an incredible view. For shopping, most people make sure to hit up the  Grand Bazaar and the  Spice Bazaar.  Personally, I hit up all the places listed except the Topkapi palace and the Spice Bazaar. It’s always good to leave a reason to go back! Of course there is much more to see and do, but these are the “don’t miss” attractions in Istanbul. Food in Istanbul I was pretty bad about remembering the names of places I ate! Turkish food is delicious and unless you are right next to a tourist attraction, you can expect great quality food at really fair prices. I do remember a couple: Pano  ( Hamalbasi Caddesi No: 12/B (Ingliliz Konsoloslugu Karsisi), Galatasaray-Beyoglu) which us bloggers went to as a group for a goodbye dinner with the team at  Blogger Casting . It’s in an old Greek house with a wine cellar in the basement. It was very cool and the food was amazing. The meat was served on swords! Rumeli Cafe  ( Sultanahmet. +90 212 512 00 08) was recommended by my hotel as the best food in Sultanahmet, which is an area known for terrible food at high prices. It was pricey but everything in this area is pricey.   Tapasuma , the restaurant at the famous hotel  Sumahan on the Water , was SO EFFING GOOD!! Kempenski Hotel  we ate dinner here for our “Gala night” which I think was fancy Turkish food. I have to say, I prefer street food more! Populist  a brand new brewery with the BEST burgers and pub snacks ever… I dream of this food (chicken fingers, sliders, chips and salsa, spinach cheese dip, etc). Other famous restaurants I meant to check out but never had time are: Changa, Mikla,  Kiyi, Park Samdan, and  Ulus 29 views.  I found these online before I went and they were on my list!  I ate a lot on this trip and had photos on my phone of foods I wanted to try. I’m happy to say I checked most of them off my list and there was only one that I found questionable. Some famous Turkish dishes I tried are: menemen which I had for breakfast only once, and it reminds me of shakshuka, doner kebabs of course, iskender kebab which is similar but unwrapped on a plate with rice and sauce on top,  pida (pide) which is kind of like a pizza, kofte which are their version of meatballs… amazeballs, especially icli kofte. I had a huge dish of   manti which is their version of ravioli covered in yogurt. It was good but the yogurt was really cold and made the dish a little cold?  Borek is fried cheese filled filo pastries… I am a big fan of all things fried, especially cheese.  Meze is something everyone will like: dishes of dips like baba ganoush, hummus, olives, bread, and other bits which is served before a meal. Baklalı Enginar  is artichoke and I have to say, I had it twice and didn’t like it any better the second time. I picked up  Dürüm  for lunch a couple times which is a meat wrap with lots of veggies added inside. I sort of skipped dessert, sorry to say! No turkish delight or Baklava for me. I also missed out on  Balık Ekmek which are the famous fish sandwiches you pick up on the street. I get so much fish in Goa, I always went for the juicy lamb instead! I did try their raw fish  Bonito  which like most raw fish, I didn’t like. You also can’t go there without trying their coffee and tea!"https://hippie-inheels.com/20-things-to-do-in-alanya-turkey-prices-video/,turkey,"Alanya is a small coastal town and while you could relax here for weeks on end, if you are in a rush you can do all the things on this list in just 5 days, 4 if you are fast! Logistics of Visiting Turkey If you’re from the U.S., you  do need a visa to visit Turkey . It’s easy to get online, and I recommend iVisa . It should only take about 15-mintues and cost around $40 for up to 90 days. I know the same goes for the U.K, as Ben needed one too. You can check out your country and rates here . You’ll also want travel insurance . I always recommend getting some sort of travel insurance for any trip simply because you never know, whether it’s eating the wrong thing or having your whole suitcase go missing. Plus, some of these activities are pretty adventurous. Of course, my top choice is World Nomads. You can easily and quickly get a quote right on their website . Getting to Alanya Turkish Airlines was the beset option for us and would be for anyone else coming from India. In fact, going onward to Greece, Turkish Airlines is the cheapest and easiest route stopping over in Istanbul (y ou can even check Kiwi, my favorite place to find cheap flights, to compare ). I suggest taking the time to see Istanbul and not just passing through. I have flown them multiple times and, I swear Turkish Airlines has the most legroom and personal space. They also give delicious cheese and tomato toasties even on the short hour flight from Istanbul to Alanya. They had all the newest movies, etc. It’s a great airline. Yes, you do have to check any electronic bigger than a phone when you fly back if you are going to the USA or UK but they gate check it for you in a safe way. Check all flights to Turkey here Getting around in Alanya There are a ton of different options for getting from the airport to your hotel. You can see all the different choices on Viator. Taxis are plenty and from my experience, fair. They all used the meter without us asking them to. It seems pretty standard. There were local buses, but I have no idea how all that works; I never took one but imagine you just hop on and pay the driver. Alanya Tourism is on top of things. There is a tourist office in town that will help you make bookings and has all the brochures on hand. Map of the Things to Do in Alanya 20 Top Things to do in Alanya, Turkey 1. Alanya Castle Bra is from here Jumpsuit is from TIA, see similar cut here , and see similar color here You can’t miss the castle which towers over the whole town. Back in the Alexander the Great days, there were pirates all over this water, and they took refuge in the castle. The walls wrap around the edge of the city from the sea up to the top of the hill. At night, they light up and it’s a really beautiful scene. You can enter for just $4 and wander around. It’s worth it just for the views from the top of the castle looking down. PS: although it’s called the castle, it is ruins of a castle. Check out tours with Alanya Castle here 2. Damlatas Cave The cave is quite small so you can see this in about 15 minutes if you want to or you can stay longer and just hang out on the benches inside. When building the harbor in Alanya in 1948, they found this cave by accident. During WWII, German soldiers hid here and it’s said that their respiratory problems were healed by the air inside the cave. It’s about $2 to enter. Check out tours with the Damlatas Caves here 3. Dockyard The Alanya Dockyard is a ruin of, well, a dockyard! It is where they used to park the ships when they needed to have work done. How they got the ships into the dock is kind of crazy. There was a Roman crane that pulled the ships up, and it pulled by having men inside a wheel like hampsters walking to make it spin. If you buy this and the Red Tower together it’s just $1 for each. See tours with the Alanya Dockyard here. 4. Red Tower The Red Tower , as mentioned, is just $1 if you buy the ticket with the dockyard. Attractions are so affordable here! These are right next to each other. You can see from the Red Tower the wall that connects to the castle. Inside you walk up to the top and there are some little boat figurines but it’s mostly just to see the view. See tours with the Red Tower here . 5. Cleopatra Beach Kleopatra Beach is the popular strip of beach and there are multiple restaurants, conveniently named by number in order. We chilled out a couple times at #22 which was a great spot. Good food, cheap drinks, and nice hammocks. Dress is from Sancerre , see similar here The water here is beautiful, so even if you’re not the time to sit around on a beach, try to take some time to enjoy the Mediterranean Sea while you’re here! It was chilly in May. See tours with Kleopatra Beach here. 6. Luxury All-inclusive hotel for only $80! I think you’ll be shocked by how affordable hotels are here. We stayed at Sunprime C Lounge, the #2 hotel in Alanya on TripAdvisor, and possibly the most luxurious one in Alanya, for just $80/night – and it’s ALL-INCLUSIVE! Check here  for rates and availability. The buffet is breakfast, lunch, and dinner and has a variety of Turkish and International food. It has options for those on a diet as well and a coffee machine. Drinks are included and there is a restaurant near the pool that everyone who books get one free meal at. The pool is wonderful and there was an underground tunnel to the sea with lots of lounge beds on the beach and out on a jetty. The rooms were huge and had the SOFTEST beds. Bottled water is included in the room rate and they even do towel animals every day on the beds. The views of the sea are perfect and we enjoyed sitting out on the huge balcony every chance we had. 7. Pirate Ship Cave Tour Back in the day, pirates were a serious thing here. Now, there are pirate ships all over the sea that you can rent out and do tours out to the caves and rocks along the coast to go cliff jumping. They do meals on board or you can get a party boat. It’s about $20 per person, but ask around at a few places and if you have a group, you might get a good discount. Check out the different tour options here 8. Lunch at Dimcayi Pinarbasi Coming down from the canyons in the mountains is an ice cold river that flows through just outside of town. There are restaurants all along the river, but this one is the most famous. This is the best meal I had in Alanya. WOW, seriously guys this is a do not miss! They will show up on Google maps. All these restaurants that are on the river are called “Dimcayi” so make sure to go to the right one. You’ll get loads of food for around $8-9. 9. Quad Tour in the Taurus Mountains While the sea is enticing, do not forget about the mountains! The Taurus mountains are beautiful. You can do Jeep tours, but I am always going to choose quadding when given the choice. I used the company Alp Quad &amp; Buggy. You can call them to book at 242 538 88 00 or you can email them at maliciftcioglu@hotmail.com. Viator also has a similar tour here . While you do have to stay in a single file line they go fast and it does have a thrill factor. There are a couple jumps (we both got some air!) and some fun tight turns to go through. They take photos and videos and sell them to you after. If you want to save money bring your own glasses and bandana which truly are necessary because of the extreme amount of dirt and dust flying up from all the quads. The price is $38 per person or $50 if you put two people on one quad. 10. Paraglide Years ago, I did hang gliding in Interlaken and loved it. In Goa, I always see the paragliders but wondered if it would have that same rush or be mellow like parasailing is. Alanya has parasailers everywhere, so I decided to give it a go. It IS thrilling! After you run off the cliff, you are lifted up into the clouds. It’s so cold up there and you can hardly see through them. I went paragliding with the company Ulu Sky. You can find out more on their website or email them at infro@ulusky.com. They will do corkscrew spins if you ask them to and if weather permits. You can buy videos and photos they take with a GoPro. It’s $55 for a ride. 11. Sapadere Canyon Jeep Tour My bag is from here! The canyon is beautiful and a great way to go up and explore the mountains. You can rent a Jeep for the day for $35 or you can take a Jeep Tour for about $25 per person. The walk through the canyon takes about 20 minutes then you reach the end where there is a waterfall. If you were interested in cycling up the mountain to here you can connect with Vela , a top cycling company. 12. Friday Market I always like seeing local markets when I travel and in Alanya, the big market is on Fridays. If you have time go into the soap shop where they make the traditional soap you would find in a hammam. The shop is called Green Body and is just on the edge of the market (it’s on Google Maps). 13. Standup Paddleboard (SUP) Due to choppy water and a looming storm, we did not get to go SUP and had to cancel. The SUP is done around the castle with some beautiful views. I asked the team to give me a couple photos to share since I had to cancel. They use a dome with GoPro to get some really cool shots and also offer SUP yoga. You can do SUP with Alanya Surf Team . It’s about $15 per person. 14. Jetski &amp; Flyboard Jet skiing is about $50 for an hour, but you can go for less time if you’d like. I was going to do this our last day before leaving for the airport but like the SUP we had to cancel due to weather. You can contact watersports-tr on their website. 15. Hamam and Spa While in Turkey, you must try a hammam. They are traditional baths and I wrote about this in this article . Since they scrub you down and I didn’t want to lose my tan, I skipped it this time and had a massage instead. I had my massage at my hotel and it was great. It’s only $15 for hammam and about $35 for a massage. You’ll find signs for hammams everywhere in town. If you’d prefer, you can book a hammam experience ahead of time on Viator. 16. Turkish Coffee &amp; Tea For just a buck you can have the strongest coffee ever. It’s very Turkish to stop and have a tea or coffee (with a cigarette) multiple times during the day from breakfast until bedtime. I had tried this years ago in Bosnia and unfortunately still find the coffee too strong for me. It’s a think bisque soupy texture with all the grounds in the tiny coffee cup. You have to at least try it! You’ll get a head rush for sure. 17. Sunset Over the Castle &amp; Sea The sunset changes place throughout the year. In the winter it sets over the sea but shifts to the side a bit in the summer and sets over the castle. It’s a really beautiful site. If you wanted to have a fancy dinner at sunset and see the castle you could go to Rihtim. It was really tasty! The lamb chops and calamari are a must. 18. Fresh Orange Juice You cannot avoid oranges here. They are obsessed! You’ll see orange trees growing everywhere and next to the “ALANYA” sign a giant revolving orange. On the streets are orange shaped shacks selling fresh orange juice. It is so tasty you would think they added MSG to it. They definitely know how to grow oranges here! I got this cool glass of juice at Kleopatra 22. 19. Go-kart I went go karting with Alanya Park. It’s in town, but you will need a taxi to reach here. You can get in touch by emailing them at gogart@hotmail.com. I don’t remember the price on this one but it must have been less than $5 if I had to guess. It was a small track but had so many turns inside that it was a blast and they do go really fast. I love go karting! Ben lapped me, though, so that sucked. 20. Eat a Truly Local Alanyan Meal The last thing that I highly suggest is to have a true Alanya lunch. There are restaurants that have food pre-cooked for lunch and ready to be served, family style by local women. You can just point out what you like. Meals are around $3-5 depending if you want a meat dish or not. I loved this meal and it was really nice to be in the local scene. The restaurant is called Feride Lenli Ev Yemekleri . Address: Sekerhane Mah Yunusgucu Sok. No, 14/A and you can call them at 0242 512 67 66."https://hippie-inheels.com/where-to-stay-in-istanbul/,turkey,"Where to Stay in Istanbul (&amp; How to Get Around) I adore Istanbul! 10 days was a long time to explore and this article will show how to get around Istanbul, a map of Istanbul, and help you answer where to stay in Istanbul and what each area is like, which was my big questions before I went. I went there just recently (Feb 2016) for 10 days and had a whirlwind trip exploring. I had a lot of time to prepare and research the city. Of course 10 days isn’t enough to “know it all” so this is just what I can share, while I’m sure there are many more great areas! I will be following up with an article on my time in each of these places. Where to stay in Istanbul How to get around Istanbul The tram system in Istanbul is amazing. I am terrible about public transportation being from Ohio and even I found it so easy to navigate. You buy a toke for 4 lira (a little over a dollar) from a machine near the stop and then use that token to get to the entrance of the tram. They come every few minutes and in my experiences were never overcrowded. I loved taking the tram around and it saves so much time from being in traffic. Because transportation was a breeze, you should not be too stressed about where to stay in Istanbul because if you can get to any area of the city quite easily and affordably. Taxis in Istanbul have a bad reputation of ripping people off. If you take a taxi or “taksi” it’s best to make sure they use the meter then follow on your phone’s GPS to see if they are going the right way. There are many one-way roads in Istanbul and drivers often take their own way which is faster, so don’t necessarily assume you are being ripped off if they veer off course. By far the easier way for me to get around was Uber. I re-downloaded the app when I arrived and found it much cheaper than a taxi drivers rates. I used it around 10 times and only spent $60 all together. I did a test by asking a driver a rate for to my hotel and got him down on price to 25-30 Lira. I told him nevermind and took an Uber which cost me 15 Lira ($5 USD) so it seems Uber is the best. It is an easy app to use as well! Download Uber here for iPhone and Android . The other car service I tried was Black Lane  who are all over Europe. I had vouchers for them so booked a two rides, one of which was to the airport when I left. They sent a driver in a suit and very fancy car to pick you up. It’s all very business class! They also sent emails saying who the driver would be and when he was outside the hotel. It’s more expensive that Uber, but you get a more luxurious experience and you  know they’ll show up whereas sometimes your Uber driver gets lost or cancels your car request. When you want to go to the other side of the river, the “Asian” side, you can use a ferry. Ferry services are in too many places to mention. Some hotels and restaurants offer a free ferry. There are also watertaxis in Istanbul but they are very expensive. Another way to go across the river is  under it via the metro. I did this to save time as the ferries stopped due to wind the the traffic on the bridge above was standstill. It took about 5 minutes and shot me out right at a tram stop on the other side. Istanbul Map Take a little look at this to familiarize yourself before you read up on which area you want to stay. To give you an idea on Uber ride costs: a ride from Nişantaşı to Sultanahmet cost 17 Lira ($6). So if you’re worried about getting around and being far from tourist attractions, keep in mind Uber is affordable and the trams are very affordable and easy. I’ve pinned all the neighborhoods I mention below plus a couple of hotels just as reference points so you can get an idea of where to stay in Istanbul on your trip. Where to Stay in Istanbul? Which Area? There are so many neighborhoods in the huge city and lots of options to choose from. I’ll give you a breakdown of the Istanbul neighborhoods so you can decide. Beyoğlu is the European side of the river, on the Eastern side, and is known for being a trendy area full of cobbled roads, great cafe’s, pubs, and shopping, as well as boutique hotels. Inside Beyoğlu are the popular areas of Taksim Square a popular tourist area, Pera (Greek neighborhood), Galata (shopping area, Galata tower, also touristy), Karakoy (very cool, trendy, young), and Istiklal street (shopping street, very busy and touristy). Also in this area is  Serdar-ı Ekrem ,  a very popular road for shopping. There are a lot of trendy boutiques. The Soho House is also in this district. Further from the tourist attractions of Istanbul, you’ll see the  Şişli district  and  Beşiktaş   which holds the very upscale Nişantaşı. It might look very far apart, but for example, I stayed at the W Hotel in Nişantaşı and could walk to Taksim in about 30 minutes. You can go even further out. As you can see Raffles hotel, who I visited for a spa treatment is way out there. Next to Raffles is the newest mall in Istanbul, Zorlu Center, which is a high-end designer mall with delicious food court! It took about 20 minutes via Uber to get from Raffles back down near Galata to Kilic Ali Pasa Hamamni where I met a friend. Even further out in  Şişli  is  Bebek, which is known for it’s pastel colored Ottoman Empire restored homes. On the other part of the European side is Sultanahmet , which is the #1 area for tourism in Istanbul as it hold the Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapı palace, and the movie-famous Basilica Cistern .  You can stay here but it’s a little more expensive in this area for shopping and food. By a little, I mean instead of a 6 Lira ($2) kebab, you could spend 16 Lira ($5). It doesn’t seem like much but you are basically going to double your food and drink costs while here. Sultanahmet is very close to the Grand Bazaar . I think it was two stops on the tram and about 10 minutes. If you stay in the Beyoğlu area and head to Sultanahment, you’ll take the tram right through Galata and the Grand Bazaar and Spice Market , making it really easy to stop and see everything. Your last place to consider is  the Asian side of the strait.  Personally, I wouldn’t do it your first couple days in Istanbul, but once you get yourself grounded, it’s really not a big deal to cross the river. I went to Sumahan on the Water for lunch via their free ferry and it was SO worth it.  Üsküdar  is the cool area over there which you can see the whole of if you zoom out. Check out here what tourist attractions you can see on the Asian side. This website is also helpful in showing the ferry schedules. The Bosphorus Strait actually does divide Istanbul into two continents. Taking a ferry ride at sunset is a big tourist attraction and if you stay on the Asian side, you can spend a lot of time on the water anyways! Overall it seems to me Sultanahmet is the place with all the tourist attractions, Beyoğlu comes in second with things to do and see, then the Asian side, then going way out toward Bebek if you have a lot of time! I know this is a lot of information to take in- but use the map and the stars and get a feel of the area before you go. It’s so worth it. It will save you time once you’re there by planning ahead and you’ll be staying at a hotel in the area you choose! Top Istanbul Hotels in Each Area I stayed in two hotels in Istanbul, and visited two hotels for their spa, and one for dinner. A few are ones that were on my well-researched list of places I was considering staying. All of these are top-notch awesome choices, with stats showing they are some of the best hotels in Istanbul. I hope you have found out where to stay in Istanbul from this article. Sultanahmet Hotels Hotel Ibrahim Pasha – I stayed 4 nights. It was THE BEST with morning coffee on the rooftop looking at the Blue Mosque. Full review to come.

Dubai is home to some of the world’s most spectacular and opulent hotels. You can choose from places such as the seven-star Burj Al Arab , the Armani Hotel , which is located in the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa , and the Park Hyatt , which epitomises understated glamour. Accommodation aside, you have everything you need for a trip full of glitz and glamour – from gigantic shopping malls that house every designer label imaginable, to trendy lounge bars with stunning city views, to ridiculously extravagant spas. What boutique hotel would you recommend to your friends that are stopping through? Dubai doesn’t really have much of a boutique hotel scene, but one place that really stands out is XVA Art Hotel in Bastakiya , which is part of the  Dubai Creek  area of the city and is brimming with character. It’s a refreshing change in a city that’s all about the five-star brand name hotels to find a place like XVA – the rooms have been decorated to reflect the architectural and cultural motifs of the region. What about 5 Star, of them all, which is the best in your town? It’s almost impossible to choose just one, as there are so many amazing five-stars in Dubai, but if I had to pick a favourite it would be the Park Hyatt . Understated glamour at its best; with its white washed walls and blue tiles, the hotel’s exterior décor is more reminiscent of a building on a Greek island! Al Burj Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? This being Dubai, you can find pretty much anything glamour related – even adventure activities. For a more traditional activity, I’d recommend doing a desert safari . For that glamorous edge, I’d suggest you look up Platinum Heritage . They organise a number of bespoke safaris, including the Heritage Night Safari, during which you drive through the desert in a vintage Land Rover, enjoy an evening of Arabic entertainment and then have the chance to try your hand at glamping! It’s all very Sex and the City 2! Where are the best hang outs during the day? I highly recommend Tom&amp;Serg – a café/restaurant that’s been garnering a lot of attention of late for its incredible coffee and delicious food. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Dubai and what are their best dishes? One of my absolute favourite restaurants in Dubai (and one that seems to have lasted the test of time in a city where new dining spots open up pretty much every week) is Teatro . It’s a lovely place to have a date in, and I highly recommend the Malaysian prawn laksa for mains. If you’re really looking to impress someone, though, Pierchic is the place to go to. Located at the end of a pier that overlooks the Burj Al Arab, this is one of the city’s most romantic restaurants. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? I have to confess that I don’t have much of a sweet tooth (I know, I know – ridiculous!) but I do have a penchant for the chocolate brownie at Hummingbird Bakery in Dubai Mall. A slab of chocolate heaven! downtown Burj Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Where to begin with this one?! S*uce  is a multibrand fashion concept where you’ll find contemporary brands as well as unique piece from up-and-coming designers. They also have the quirkiest gifts and home interior accessories – there’s always something new to discover! Most people shop in the malls, as they contain pretty much every brand – high street or designer – imaginable. Dubai Mall is the biggest, so if you’re looking for the ultimate shopping day out I’d head there. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Dubai? I used to get my hair done at Slam , which is located in the trendy and upcoming industrial area of Al Quoz (where you’ll also find the aforementioned Tom&amp;Serg café). If you ever head there ask for Ali – she was my hairstylist for four years while I was living in Dubai and makes even my unruly hair look amazing. As for spas, well you’re truly spoilt for choice! If budget isn’t an issue, go all out and head to the Talise Ottoman Spa at the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Hotel on the Palm Jumeirah . They have thalassotherapy pools, snow rooms, saunas, hydrotheraphy rooms and floating baths. They also have a mind-blowing Turkish Hammam, which is something you simply must try. The Burj Khalifa and the Burj Al Arab Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? There are two spots I’d recommend for sundowners in Dubai. My favourite is Neos in the Address Hotel, Downtown . The bar is located on the 63 rd floor and overlooks the Burj Khalifa, and is the best place to enjoy a drink while watching the sun sink into the horizon. The second spot is 360 , which is a bar that’s located at the end of the pier and offers stunning views of both the sea and the city. This place also has outdoor seating, so is the perfect spot during the cooler months! Now the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot? If you’re looking for a laid-back but stylish place, head to Karma Café, which serves delicious watermelon martinis. The outdoor terrace also offers great views of the Dubai Fountain and Burj Khalifa.

Kyiv’s foreign reputation doesn’t scream luxury, so I was really surprised at how on trend the cafes, restaurants, bars, salons and activities were, and all really inexpensive, so you can do things you might not ordinarily be able to afford. It’s one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe so there’s rich history to be discovered. To top it all, the people were some of the sweetest I’ve ever met. What 5 star hotel is the best in Kiev?

I haven’t tried it yet, but Hotel Vozdvyzhensk has the perfect location next to my favourite street, Andrievsky Descent, in Podil. Rooms are said to be small but cute and comfortable. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Kiev?

Kyiv’s Orthodox churches are real gems, whether you are religious or not. Visiting the churches is also educational because it holds a lot of Kyiv’s history. Mezhyhirya Park This “Museum of Corruption” is the residence of Ukraine’s former President, displaying his luxurious lifestyle. After he abandoned the estate during the 2014 revolution, it opened to the public.

The atmosphere is quite relaxed if you want to take a breather from your day tours. Mariyinsky Park This 130-year old park in the Pechersk neighborhood is beautiful in summer or winter. Hydropark I am dying to come back to Kyiv in summer, and when I do, would like to try Hydropark. There is an outdoor gym, boat and kiddie rides. Plus you can enjoy the beach and get a tan. Many people come to relax and get a tan by the water. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Kyiv and what are their best dishes?   There are different good restaurants in Kyiv as it could cater to whatever your taste pallet would desire. Kanapa If you want to taste high quality Ukrainian cuisine then I recommend visiting Kanapa. It has a sophisticated interior and all their ingredients are grown from their own farm. A must-try is their borsch served in a giant head of cabbage. Let’s talk desserts in Kiev- what place makes the best? Honey A nice little café that offers a variety of desserts from simple treats to tasty macarons. Also keep your eyes open for markets – you’ll find all kinds of treats on offer. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Kiev? Atelier 1 Atelier 1 is one of the few concept-stores in Kiev. It’s located in heart of the city, just a few minutes away from the ancient market of Bessarabka. They offer different designer clothes and also has a perfume section. One attraction here is the place offers clothes made by local Ukrainian designers and provides them their own corner to showcase their designs. Kachorovska Atelier The trendiest place in Podil to shop for custom-made shoes. While you shop you can also have a delicious light lunch or coffee, prepared by the nicest barista and baker in town.

G-Bar The most fun place to get your hair or nails done before an event. You can also rent an outfit and book a photoshoot. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? One of the joys of Kyiv is discovering all the beautiful viewpoints. Try catching the views from the Motherland monument, Saint Sophia Cathedral or the People’s Friendship Arch.  Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Alchemist Bar A cocktail bar located in the university quarter (where it’s easy to bar hop). The bartenders are really friendly and the cozy atmosphere makes it easy to meet people. Paravoz This is a unique venue located in the basement of a cinema specializing in cocktails. It gets really full in the evenings, so you may want to consider coming early. Side note: I spotted singer Jamala, the Ukrainian Eurovision winner here and was too shy to say hi, but she smiled at me! Pink Freud Again, a cocktail place. This one is located in Podil and is a good spot to grab a table with friends. I can think of even more good bars in Kyiv…but I’d better stop there. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? I didn’t do a lot of clubbing in Kyiv, but some of the more upscale clubs in town include: Arena Entertainment Complex &amp; Night Club It is a large entertainment complex favoured by both locals and foreigners. It’s the main venue for major concerts as well. They offer a number of different bars, so there’s something to suit everyone’s style. Caribbean Club The majority of the crowd here is foreigner, but it was recommended to me by locals as a fancy with reasonably priced food and drinks."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2016/03/things-to-do-in-san-francisco/,usa,"5 FREE and Fun Things to Do in San Francisco, California One of the most unique parts of California is the city of San Francisco. Its liberal, artsy culture, makes it a hotspot for anyone looking to express their true selves without fear of judgment. An indirect benefit for tourists is that there is plenty to do in San Francisco that is completely free. It gives you a great opportunity to take the weight off your pocket, and have fun without having to blow your budget. These are 5 of the best free things to do in San Francisco.       WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Golden Gate Bridge 2. Amoeba Music’s free shows 3. Art Galleries 4. Open-mic poetry slams at Cafe Royale 5. Lombard Street Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Golden Gate Bridge Of course, you won’t leave San Francisco without seeing the Golden Gate Bridge . SF’s most famous landmark is one of the 7 wonders of the modern world. It was called “the bridge that couldn’t be built”, and its creation was far from easy. But, in 1937, the bridge was opened to the public. It cost “$35 million in principal and $39 million in interest and 11 workers’ lives.” Take a walk across the 1.7 mile Golden Gate Bridge, totally free. It’s worth it! 2. Amoeba Music’s free shows Amoeba Music is a huge record store made out of a former bowling alley. You’ll find a free show being set up in the corner – if you time your visit right. Otherwise, it’s still a sight to be seen, with vintage vinyls sold for $1 a pop. 3. Art Galleries San Francisco boasts dozens of art galleries that are totally free to visit. Weird, unexpected art shows happen regularly, especially on weekends. Try the immense 4-floor 49 Geary. Ratio 3, and the Diego Rivera Gallery are also extremely cool. 4. Open-mic poetry slams at Cafe Royale Cafe Royale is a Parisian style cafe, that hosts free events all week long. Their open-mic poetry slams are a particular draw. Plus, the screen independent films on a regular basis, if you’re willing to risk a trippy adventure. Whether or not you’re looking to save money, San Francisco has loads of free attractions that would be worth paying for! These are often the best ways to take in the culture – one that is truly unique. 5. Lombard Street Lombard Street Lombard Street is known as “the crookedest street in the world”. It’s mesmerizing to look at, with its most well known stretch containing 8 hair-pin turns in quick succession. It needs all these turns because of its steepness. Without them, people could be killed rolling down. There are also some famous homes on Lombard Street, if you know where to look .

Las Vegas really is a place that showcases the best of the best, from fine dining and trendy restaurants, to luxurious hotels, designer shops and the incredible entertainment. Of course Vegas has its rather less-glamorous areas but if you go to the right places you’re sure to be wowed by Sin City. What 5-star hotel is the best in your Las Vegas? The Encore Hotel is the very best in my opinion ( see a review here ), it’s the sister hotel to the Wynn, both owned by casino magnate, Steve Wynn. The Encore is the ultimate in lavish accommodation whilst still being chic and classy. The hotels rooms are gorgeous, comfortable and stylish and there’s a huge array of world class restaurants, and a whole avenue of beautiful fashion boutiques. I would recommend staying in one the Tower Suites at the Encore for that extra level of luxury. In these more exclusive rooms you have VIP check in, a dedicated concierge and access to the Tower Suites pool. Another incredible hotel that’s worth checking out is The Bellagio, even if it’s just to see the iconic fountains.

That being said, many of the big hotels now also include smaller hotels within them so that guests can have a more personalized service. For a more chilled out hotel, The Mandalay Bay Hotel also has a Four Seasons hotel within it. There’s no casino, so the experience is more low key than some of the giants of Vegas. It was still under-construction on my last visit but I’d also love to try the Nobu Hotel in Caesar’s Palace . Nobu is one of my favorite restaurants and I’d be keen to check out a hotel owned by the famous chef and his business partner Robert De Niro.  Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Las Vegas? Total dare devils can check out the rides at the Stratosphere hotel such as X-Scream which leaves you dangling 109 storeys in the air or Insanity, a giant mechanical arm which holds you 900ft in the air. If white knuckle rides aren’t your thing, a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon would make an exciting adventure; you can even have a champagne breakfast in the canyon itself. Where are the best hang outs during the day? Despite my love of Las Vegas, I’m not really interested in gambling but obviously roulette, poker and the slot machines are a major draw for many visitors. For me one of the best places to hang out during the day is by the pool. The Encore Beach Club is fantastic if you want to party and drink champagne whilst dancing to world class DJs. For a more relaxed vibe the Encore and The Wynn both have stunning pools. I would suggest hiring a cabana for the day and enjoying your own private space with a TV, sofas and snacks included. There’s also some great lunch spots to check out and I’d recommend Olives at The Bellagio for a view of the fountain show and Sushi Samba at The Venetian for break from shopping. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Las Vegas and what are their best dishes? The most upscale restaurant in Las Vegas is Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand where you can experience the acclaimed chef’s fine French cuisine. If you like taking in the view, I’d also recommend the Eiffel Tower in the Paris Hotel which is incredibly romantic and has a view over the Bellagio Fountains. For more trendy restaurants I love Yellow Tail at the Bellagio, particularly the tuna sashimi pizza and the amazing view of the strip. I also love Hakkasan in the MGM Grand for a fantastic atmosphere and incredible upscale Chinese food – try the dim sum platter.  Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? If you’re looking for a vast selection of quality desserts, your first point of call should be one of the buffets in one of the top luxury hotels. The Encore has a total decadent feast of pastries, cakes and sweets and a chocolate fountain. Though I’ve never been, I have heard that the Sugar Factory at The Planet Hollywood Resort is legendary and serves sweet treats twenty-four hours a day and even has a chocolate lounge. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Las Vegas! The Wynn and Encore Esplanades have a great hand-picked selection of luxury fashion boutiques and brands to browse through without feeling too overwhelmed. If you want a vast selection of both designer brands and more affordable shops, then I’d really recommend a trip to the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. The shopping centre is 875,000 square foot and includes entertainment, restaurants and the opportunity to take a gondola ride on the Grand Canal that runs through it. What are some of the most unique things that you can do in Vegas? Well, Vegas is the only place that you can visit Paris, Venice, ancient Rome and Egypt in one day…the themed hotels are really fun to explore so I’d definitely recommend having a good walk around the strip. You can visit the Neon Museum Boneyard which houses all the vintage signs from ‘Old Vegas’ or take a spin on the High Roller, the world largest Ferris Wheel. I would also recommend seeing a Cirque de Soleil show such as La Reve at The Wynn or the Michael Jackson inspired ONE, at The Mandalay Bay Hotel. Also if you want a quick and easy wedding you’ve come to the right place…Vegas is one of the world’s most popular places to get married due to the speed and ease of acquiring a marriage license, plus you can get married by an Elvis impersonator ;) Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? There’s some great restaurants and bars with views over the strip to catch the sunset from. I loved the Eiffel Tower restaurant at the Paris Hotel and the Skyfall lounge at The Delano gives panoramic views across the city. If you want to get away from the city lights, Red Rock Canyon is only around 30 minutes from the main strip. Visit and you can witness the beautiful desert rocks glowing red as the sunsets in the background. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. For a bit of sparkle and glamour, The Chandelier Bar at The Cosmopolitan Hotel is visually incredible. It’s a three level bar located among 2 million threaded crystals. For a quiet drink before dinner, check out Parasol Down at the Wynn where you have a view of the 40-foot waterfall over the Lake of Dreams. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? XS at the Encore is my favorite club of all time, with a glittering backdrop you can dance the night away on the dance floor or enjoy a cabana around the pool. Tryst at The Wynn is also totally unique, with indoor and outdoor space and a 90-foot waterfall! For an opulent setting and world class DJs also check out The Bank at The Bellagio or Hakkasan, an 80,000 square foot night club belonging to the prestigious restaurant brand."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-miami/,usa,"What makes Miami a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?

You have a view on the bay from there, so you can see the how the sun goes down over the skyline of Miami downtown. Sunset Lounge,  Lounge · West Avenue,  1100 West Ave (at the Mondrian), Miami Beach, FL 33139, USA Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot.

Juviva,  Restaurant und Cocktailbar,  1111 Lincoln Rd (at Lenox Ave), Miami Beach, FL 33139, USA If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? That’s too hard to choose. We`re talking about Miami so there are a bunch of fancy clubs where you can end the night. I like set, wall, mansion… but there are a lot more. Make sure you check the program before. But every night something is going on. If you like it a bit different, check out Bodega Taqueria y Tequila . Yeah it’s a small restaurant where you get served Mexican streetfood. But if you make it through the blue door, and the room with high urinals, there`s something else waiting for you."https://hippie-inheels.com/cheap-flights-to-hawaii/,usa,"Finally Cross Hawaii Off Your Bucket List With This $341 Round-Trip Flight Growing up, when I pictured what paradise must be like, I pictured Hawaii. I always had it in my head one day that is where I’d have the perfect honeymoon. While it’s part of the USA, Hawaii always seems so exotic. I finally got a chance to visit and I didn’t want to leave so I extended my trip and ended up staying a month bouncing from island to island with my boyfriend. Waking up surfing , have a Lomi Lomi massage to help out my sore muscles, smelling plumeria in the air, and eating the best poke, soft buttery taro rolls, and of course – shave ice, and somehow every single day ending with an even better sunset than the one before. Why leave!? We spent our days busy – no beach lounging for us. Instead, helicopter rides over Maui that brought happy tears to my eyes, SUP in Waikiki and watching the sea turtles below, canyoning, horse-back riding, driving the Road to Hana, scuba-diving, and snorkeling… the list goes on and on! From the volcanoes of Maui to the surfers at the North Shore in Oahu to the secluded beaches of the big island and Waimea Canyon of Kaui, Hawaii has adventure and beauty for days! I’m always looking for deals to get back to Hawaii (I have mother-daughter trips in mind and girlfriend getaways planned!). That’s why I freaked when I saw a round-trip flight to Hawaii for $341 . Your dream trip to Hawaii just got much more realistic. Cheap Flights to Hawaii With Next Vacay When people think of taking a week or two-week vacation in the USA, they tend to go to Florida, North Carolina, or maybe California. Hawaii has always seemed like a “save it for the honeymoon” or “save it for later” kind of place. Why? Because the flights are often expensive and people always say it’ll cost a couple of grand to have a vacation in Hawaii. But this is often in your head. You don’t have to stay at a 5-star hotel on the beach. Actually, I stayed in Hawaii for a month and did a lot of Airbnb rentals, cooking at home, and staying at small inns rather than resorts. I rented surfing and snorkeling equipment from small shops rather than booking tours. You can do Hawaii on a budget – and it might even feel more authentic. I use Next Vacay to be on the lookout for insanely good deals since they email me a few times a week (sometimes a few times a day). They emailed me this deal of $341   for Hawaii and I immediately called my mom to see if we should book a trip. The price was so low and I feel like people just don’t imagine that you can go to Hawaii for this price from the mainland. I get so stoked when Next Vacay send out deals like this and end up tweeting about it all the time because it just lets people actually go the places they dream about – wanderlust in action! Next Vacay has been one of my  favorite websites for travel  for over two years now. You can read my full review here . After you get the flight booked, you get to start planning your trip! You’ll have to think about which island really calls to you. Each island is so different and while Oahu is often visited most because of Waikiki and the Pearl Harbor memorial. Many people will tell you the Big Island is totally overlooked and you should prioritize it in your plans. Kaui is known as the most beautiful (it’s where Jurassic Park was filmed) and Maui is definitely a chilled honeymoon spot. These are the four most popular and it’s usually best to pick just two on your first trip. Try to use the money you saved on the flight to treat yourself to a surf lesson or book a touristy yet amazing luau even if just to eat the delicious buffet. You can do a mix of pre-planned activities and finding your own adventure. For example, one day you might want to take equipment from the hotel to snorkel from the shore but another day you can splurge out on a catamaran tour to snorkel at a small nearby island. You don’t have to do tours for everything. With a rental car, you can go explore bamboo forests and find secret waterfalls all on your own.  Visiting just a couple of islands means there’s always a great reason to come back! You might just be rolling your eyes thinking “ there is no way I can go”.  Whether it’s money, time off of work, or family commitments, you’re more likely to find a reason to stay home than to go."https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2017/01/new-york-best-restaurants/,usa,"JustFly Reviews: Top 10 Best Restaurants in New York City New York is one of America’s best food destinations.

It is the city of A-list celebrities, the big names in sports and entertainment. This vibrant metropolis has become synonymous with success. This is where stars are made, attracting dreamers from all over the world. But dreamers are not the only ones drawn to the shimmer of tinseltown — tourists, too! Over the past several decades, Los Angeles has become one of the most visited destinations in the United States. And as visitors keep flooding in, more accommodation options become available. Los Angeles has a wide selection of hotels that can cater to both ends of the budget spectrum. The list of attractions is constantly growing. New restaurants helmed by acclaimed chefs sprout along its streets. And there’s always a new science, history or art museum that is worth checking out every year. While Los Angeles is often considered one of the most expensive cities in the country, don’t let it deter you from going. Even if you’re on a budget, there are noteworthy attractions that you can visit without pawning your house. In fact, some of them can be enjoyed for FREE!   WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? La Brea Tar Pits Venice Canals Runyon Canyon The Griffith Observatory Mariachi Plaza Annenberg Space for Photography The Los Angeles City Hall The Bradbury Building The Broad Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts La Brea Tar Pits In 1875, paleontologists found animal remains in Rancho La Brea’s pits — bubbled with asphalt from a petroleum lake. More than a century later, the professionals are still working on the area, even after dragging approximately 3.5 million fossils from the area. Many of their discoveries are now in a museum, which has changed much for decades. The excavation tours and Page Museum have admission fees, but the museum waives them every first Tuesday of the month (except July and August) and every Tuesday in September. But because of high demand, it would be best to reserve tickets ahead of time.   Venice Canals The Venice Canals are right between the Venice Boardwalk and the Abbot Kinney; the canals provide you with a different perspective of the famous beachfront neighborhood. Strolling through the canal-lined blocks offers idyllic scenes, quaint beach houses, arching bridges, ducklings, and even a dog that paddleboards. There are no boat rentals that allow you to explore, but you can bring a non-motorized vessel to go around the neighborhood.   Runyon Canyon Runyon Canyon measures 160 acres and has one main loop and several hiking trails that visitors can explore. If you decide to go during the weekends and weekday mornings, you might run into several trainers hiking with their clients. However, as the day goes on, the crowds dwindle and you will now have enough time and space to enjoy nature. This park provides you with some of the best views of the metropolis; you may also run into some celebrities trying to squeeze a workout into their tight schedules.   The Griffith Observatory The vista provided by the observatory is something you shouldn’t miss when you visit Los Angeles. The city below twinkles and glistens with lights once the sky turns black. When you go inside, you’ll see different exhibits such as a planetarium show, Tesla coil, and a Foucault pendulum. Before the 10pm closing time, make sure to look through the 12-inch refracting telescope. An alternative to the latter is the reflecting telescope on the front lawn.   Mariachi Plaza The Mariachi Plaza has decades of LA tradition and also has some of its best music. Mariachi bands have been gathering around the plaza since the 1930s. The musicians are dressed in their traditional Mexican horsemen attire or charro while waiting for someone to hire them to play at business establishments or even parties. Many of the musicians live in the historical and classic 1889 Boyle Hotel.   Annenberg Space for Photography This is a privately funded space that specializes in photography; it approaches the niche in an innovative way when it comes to displaying print and digital pieces. It integrates music and/or videos into the images posted on the display walls. This combination provides a unique experience for visitors. Admission is free but there is a $1 parking fee.   The Los Angeles City Hall This white tower has been the city’s icon since the 1920s; today it provides the easiest way to get a view of Downtown, if you get the chance to pass through the Civic Center on weekdays from 9am to 5pm, enter on the Main Street side so that you can go to the observation deck on the 27th floor. While in the area, take a stroll around the park and try to find the 1984 Olympic torch. There’s a lot of history in the area, taking a walk around it will be like reminiscing decades past.   The Bradbury Building The building’s nondescript appearance may make it seem less significant; however, once you walk through the entrance, you will see a beautiful alley of wood, bricks, and iron. This architectural gem is an ideal place to visit for history lovers because the building is one of the oldest in Downtown. If you like movies, the zigzagging staircases were shown in a scene in Blade Runner. You won’t be able to explore the building; you’d have to do your admiring of the design from the ground floor as most of the building is for private offices.   The Broad The Broad is Los Angeles’s newest contemporary art museum and it is also the public home of 2,000 post-war art works of Eli and Edythe’s collection. When you visit, you get to see familiar works from Jeff Koons and Andy Warhol as well as the magnificent installation “Infinity Mirrored Room” by Yayoi Kusama. There is also an olive tree grove in the museum’s plaza; the museum admission is free, but it is recommended to get a reservation first before going. —– There’s no doubt that LA is an expensive city, but there are enough free things to do and see to save money on your trip. Those listed above are only some of the places you can visit, explore Los Angeles at your own time and pace to experience everything that the city has to offer.​"https://hippie-inheels.com/3-days-in-miami-little-havana-wynwood-and-more/,usa,"3 Days in Miami: Little Havana, Wynwood, and more It’s been long overdue but I finally made it to and spent 3 days in  Miami . Now that I know the area, I almost want to start watching the  Real Housewives of Miami  so I can be like “oh, I went there!”. I drove down from Kissimmee with my mom in our rental car (from Sixt, who FYI charged us crazy amounts for the tolls) and it took about 3 hours I think. Next time I come to Florida , I’ll get the Sunpass for the tolls. 3 Days in Miami: how my mom and I spent our time Where to Stay Near South Beach We checked in at a super cute hotel called Sense Beach House which was right next to South Beach. I was a little overwhelmed at first as it was their Sunday brunch and we weren’t sure where the actual hotel entrance was – and we had the car pulled over in a no-park zone. But, they told us to unload and the valet would come. Valet was $29 a night but the nearby lot was charging $31 per night and it was just a dude packing cars in as tight as they’d fit so valet was the best choice there. When getting around we just did Uber as parking is kind of stressful around Miami and isn’t free. Our room was really nice, large, and had a wrap around balcony that you could see the ocean from. Each of the 18 rooms are different in this boutique hotel. There is a rooftop pool here as well which we did use since the beach was really crowded for the weekend. There was even a surf board shower up there! We had brunch at their restaurant, The Local House , and it was the bomb. My mom was in love with her eggs benedict. South Beach &amp; Ocean Drive We spent Sunday walking around South Beach and Ocean Drive (the road that runs parallel to the beach). You can walk up from 5th to 13th street to see all the famous Art Deco buildings. We didn’t have time to check out what was on Lincoln Road that night, but apparently it’s a don’t miss for nightlife and designer shops so I’ll have to go there next time. So-Fi (South of Fifth) For dinner, we did a restaurant hop around the area our hotel was in called So-Fi (South of Fifth). I was told this is a really cool up and coming spot that will be getting even more cool restaurants in bars in the next year or two. We first went to Cibo , a fancy Italian wine bar. There was a wine cellar in the middle of the room with glass walls and you can see the wine tastings going on inside. We got to have one which was set up by the tourism board. Whenever they need a bottle from the top, the woman in there puts on a harness and goes up to get the wine! She does little tricks and everyone in the restaurant started taking pictures. It was really cool. I think we let the girl doing the wine tasting down when the only smells we could guess where “winey” and the taste was “grape” haha, okay we weren’t THAT bad, but we were pretty bad. Their bread was the best bread I think I’ve ever had though – but we were off to our next stop for dinner. For dinner, we ate at the popular restaurant, Red, the Steakhouse . THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING. You have to eat here when you come to Miami! By the way, all of these places I’m mentioning have been walkable from our hotel. Mom had a steak and I had the veal parmigiana (kicking myself that I chose steak &amp; eggs at breakfast and was steak’d out!) Turns out, the veal was out of this world and as big as my head. Everything was so so tasty here. It was expensive, like $50 for a steak but that’s the same price as a chain like Ruth’s Chris (only way better). As we walked back to our hotel, we stopped in at South Pointe Tavern . The menu had really unique drinks on it. I got the Miami State of Mind because it had jalapenos in it and mom got one with Pimms. Downtown Miami Our second day in Miami, we had two tours scheduled which are the top two tours in Miami and you wouldn’t want to miss them: a graffiti tour of Wynwood and a culinary tour of Little Havana. But, we didn’t have anything until noon so since we were headed out that way via Uber, we got dropped off at the Brickell City Centre because it’s a new mall there. It was mostly really fancy brands but some affordable things like Zara and Bath &amp; Body Works. I went into Caudalie and had a fantastic massage. I think was going through withdrawal since I have them almost weekly in Asia! Little Havana Food Tour – Don’t Miss This! I showed up to this tour hungry like they said to which wasn’t hard because I show up to everything hungry. I’m just always ready to eat (it’s a skill). Our tour was with Miami Culinary Tours (the #1 company there) and we met for the start at  Agustin Gainza Arts And Tavern which was part of the tour. Go early and get a coffee there!  I was surprised how small Little Havana is. It was hardly any walking to hit up all the famous places. I feel like I shouldn’t give them all away as then they might lose business, but I sort of already tagged each place on Instagram Stories (whoops). But, we went to all the top spots to try empanadas, their unique coffee, a REAL mojito where Billy Holiday used to play, the best Cuban sandwich, a guava pastry, and a local ice cream shop that does Cuban flavors. But we also learned about the culture and their past with America and, of course, stopped into a Cuban cigar shop (where they were making them in front of us). At one point we went to a fruit stall which was funny because we tried sugar cane juice (a key drink in India!). My mom and I liked this best of everything we did in Miami. Grafitti Tour in Wynwood Art District You can’t do a graffiti tour with anyone except  Miami’s Best Graffiti Guide if you want a truly authentic tour. Our guide Ryan “the wheelbarrow” is a graffiti artist himself and knows the other artists personally. It was a unique tour and it was a time to finally understand how these artists actually make a living doing this (as it’s not actually just kids scribbling – it’s serious). … but it was also a good time for me to get some cool pictures for Instagram and by the looks of it that is what other people were doing, too! Little Havana is very close to Wynwood so if you go to both I recommend using Uber and not worrying about parking. For short distances like this we did the Uber Carpool and since the distance was so short no one else needed a ride at the same time + it was like 1/4 of the price.  What else? That night we checked out the Design District but were so stuffed we didn’t even have dinner and crashed out early since we were going to do stand up paddle board the next morning. The Design District has luxury shops, boutique local shops and of course artist’s galleries. Whenever I see famous people on Instagram in Miami, they always tag this area so it must be the “cool place”. The last thing we did in Miami was SUP before driving down to the keys. We went to Sailboards Miami to do this but they don’t just do SUP, they actually do windsurfing classes here! I’d love to learn that one day, too. You can park here for free and that was lucky since we drove straight from here to the Keys! If we had more time we would have done a barre class at Exhale Spa , and  Española Way /Washington Avenue Shopping District  but unfortunately, time did not allow… another reason to come back!"https://hippie-inheels.com/little-guide-to-honolulu/,usa,"My Little Guide to Honolulu I was in Honolulu less than a week, so as I said this is a “little” guide to Honolulu; just a peak at some of my favorite parts of Honolulu. I want to also add that it’s ideal to get out of Waikiki and drive to North Shore for example to watch surfers and eat at the famous shrimp trucks, but as Ben and I were both there for work and I had to get my passports re-issued, we didn’t find the time. We did lots of time to explore Waikiki. I decided to write this as a Q &amp; A just for fun. this is a statue of Duke, the creator of surfing- at the center of Waikiki beach What is Waikiki? It’s the first beach in Honolulu, Oahu that was developed and is where most of the hotels are located. It’s near the airport and Pearl Harbor, so most people stay in this area. The beach is crowded but there’s so much to do from SUP to volleyball or tennis all along the stretch. We did SUP and our friend Jito saw a turtle. You can also just watch the surfers. Should I rent a car in Honolulu? It really depends. Most hotels have shuttles to Pearl Harbor, which is the biggest tourist attraction for obvious reasons. If you want to explore Oahu (and you should even though I didn’t) you’ll need a car. Uber is available and taxis are all over so you won’t be stranded. Hotels and every restaurant charge for parking so if you don’t explore the island then don’t rent a car. Some rental tips for Dollar and Thrifty (the main companies): If you pick up near airport, you have to drop at same place or there is a higher charge. If you pick up on Waikiki, it’s the same but they aren’t open all night so you’re kind of screwed. Also, Budget rental is terrible, we almost used them but bolted when we saw the beat up car they wanted us to take. We used both Dollar and Thrifty between Oahu and Maui and they gave us Mazda’s as a compact car at a good price. Also, there is no airport shuttle at night for the car-hire places. What’s the bar scene like on Waikiki? Places actually don’t stay open that late in Waikiki and we didn’t check out any clubs- don’t think it’s really that type of place, although the #1 club Addiction was in my hotel, The Modern and is only open Thur- Sat. It’s 10 bucks for girls and 20 for guys. We were told that Lulu’s and Duke’s is where locals go to drink, but since it’s on the strip with all the hotels I don’t know if that’s true. Also, it was almost impossible to get a table at either. Another tip a friend (the girl I met on the goMowgli tour) told me is to get to China town for a funky nightlife. She said that’s where locals hang out and it’s really fun. Too little time for me though! Where should we eat in Honolulu? We were recommended a lot of local places. The first down by Diamond head at the end of the beach was called Barefoot. They didn’t have booze but had a laid back feel, fried fish, and a guy with a guitar! Tiki’s on the strip was delicious and I took some photos there. We tried everything: smoked meat, ahi tuna, sweet duck, a seafood dip, lamb with garlic shrimp and gnocchi, apple dessert and chocolate spring rolls. We were pretty let down by Chart House and it was really expensive to boot. We wish we had more time to try places a family friend Rick who’s very familiar with Honolulu recommended: Nico’s at Pier 38, pies at Ted’s Bakery, Haleiwa Joes, and Soul De Cuba. There are ABC stores all over where you can pick up snacks and ready-made sandwiches to take to the beach. I might have had a few hotdogs from there – I know…. but they were so good. What’s the shopping like on Waikiki? There are shops all along the strip. Lots are surf shops like Billabong and RVCA but they have high-end and even Urban Outfitters. There was a place behind Urban called “cookies” and I found some really cute rings there, one is a starfish. Inland a few streets you’ll find Walgreens, Walmart and malls. The main swim shops are San Lorenzo which are brazilian bikinis (aka really tiny). I picked up some Sun Bum sunscreen which smells like bananas and Maui Babe tanning lotion which is famous in Hawaii. Overall, everything is pretty expensive so I didn’t shop much. Where to Stay in Waikiki? I stayed in two places that you can read detailed reviews on: the mid-range boutique hotel, VIVE Hotel Waikiki which is under $200 bucks per night, and the luxury boutique #2 hotel in Honolulu, The Modern Honolulu which was an insanely kick-ass place to stay. Both were in ideal locations and I had no qualms with either. My parents stayed at the Sheraton a couple of years ago and loved it. What do you do in Honolulu? Most people come just for a beach vacation. You can enjoy the ocean: snorkel, scuba, stand up paddle, surf, and swim. You can go to the Pearl Harbor museum. Party, eat, shop… it’s really just a great place to relax! As for luau’s, the general consensus is to save that for Maui. Check out Diamond Head which is at the end of the strip. For places to visit, manoa falls trail and ‘lolani palace. Extra things to look out for: Friday fireworks at from the Hilton and the tiki torches being lit on the beach each night. Waikiki was pretty cool and a great place for a vacation! I don’t think I’d  move here but can’t wait to go back and check out the rest of the island."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-richmond-virginia/,usa,"What makes Richmond a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Richmond was rough for a lot of years but then it became really cool.   Thanks to the efforts of the local government, the Virginia Board of Tourism, and the expansion of Virginia Commonwealth University’s downtown campus, the city is now more colorful, friendly, and alive than ever.  In the past ten years Richmond has seen a renaissance of sorts. The university’s expansion has brought with it everything that comes with hip, urban, millennial culture. Upscale shopping, boutique hotels, cool coffee shops, wine bars, beer culture, and a proud indie music scene. In 2015 Richmond was voted as Travel + Leisure’s number two best place to visit in the world (yes, the world) and hosted the UCI Road World Championship. What hotel is the best in Richmond? If you’re going for the Neo-Classical, old southern vibe I suggest the Jefferson Hotel . It is Richmond’s premiere hotel for everything that is elegant and southern. Think lots of marble, gaudy stained glass, bronze cherubim, cigar smoke, and thick southern accents. Hell, they even filmed parts of Gone With The Wind at The Jefferson. Their bar is great for a low key nightcap and a visit to see their Christmas tree around the holidays has become an annual tradition.  If you’re looking for something modern and chic I suggest the Quirk Hotel which opened last year. Their rooftop bar draws both hotel guests as well as locals for a drink on a warm evening to watch the sun set over the James River.     I want to do some shopping. Where should I go in Richmond? Carytown is the place to go if you’re looking for a boutique shopping experience. With upscale stores like popular Need Co. and Traveling Chic Boutique, Carytown will be your place to go for unique and trendy finds.     If you’re looking for more mainstream, upscale brands like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Prada, etc. you will have to head to Stony Pointe Shopping Center.  By far the most popular shopping center in Richmond is the Short Pump Shopping Center, about 20 minutes drive from downtown in Short Pump. Here you will find the midrange clothing stores for the masses like H&amp;M, Urban Outfitters, J. Crew, Orvis, Hollister, Free People, and the like.     What should I do during the day in Richmond? There’s a lot more to do doing the day than just shop and drink (see below). As the old capitol of the Confederacy, there is a huge amount of Civil War history and many historical sites to see in Richmond. In the historic Church Hill neighborhood you can visit St. John’s Church where Patrick Henry made his famous “give me liberty or give me death” speech. Just around the corner from the church is beautiful Libby Hill park where visitors can watch the sun set over the city. Easily accessible by suspension bridge from downtown is Belle Isle , a large recreational park in the middle of the James River. The rocky rapids are a popular hangout for young people in the warm months. If you’re feeling adventurous, several tour companies offer river excursions like kayaking and rafting on the Belle Isle rapids as well.     My favorite daytime activity in Richmond is visiting the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts . Large and quite dense for its location, the VMFA has a diverse collection of American, European, African, and Asian art ranging from Ancient to Modern works. Notable artists include Dürer, Monet, Picasso, and Pollock. Have a look at the VMFA’s calendar of events for new exhibitions and upcoming events.       Let’s talk drinks- what place makes the best? The craft beer scene has boomed in Richmond over the past several years. You could really spend your whole visit hopping around from brewery to brewery. RVA Trolly Tours will shuttle you from to and from local breweries so you can leave your keys at home.   A few of the local favorites are Legend Brewery, Hardywood Brewery, and Strangeway’s Brewery.  If you’re more of a wine person I suggest checking out Secco Wine Bar at their new location on Robinson St. With a laid back international vibe and extensive wine list, Secco is a great place to hang out and chat. Make sure to check out their menu of cheeses and small tapas style dishes. Hands down, my favorite place to go for a cocktail in Richmond is Pasture. Creativity is what counts when it comes to developing a strong cocktail list. Each drink on their menu is named after a town in Virginia and they’re all unique in their own right. Bartender Beth knows exactly what she is doing behind the bar! My personal favorite is the Surrey; bourbon, smoked syrup, and a bit of lemon—delicious.       Let’s do brunch. Brunch is a southern tradition as old as the Virginia itself. If you’re hungover in Richmond or you’re looking to keep the party going I suggest Millie’s Diner, Hill Café, or The Daily. Every one of these places has a delicious brunch offering. Expect a wait when you arrive; it’s no secret that these places are the best. Where should I go for dinner in Richmond? When I say Richmond has gone through a renaissance, I’m really referring to its gastro-culture. A handful of really nice, upscale-but-still-chill-enough-to-wear-jeans-to restaurants have opened in the past few years and really put Richmond on the map. Some notable mentions for a night out would be The Roosevelt, Heritage, Pasture (mentioned above), Saison, and Metzger’s. But because I am writing this review I’m going to tell you that the little Italian joint Mama Zu is by far the best spot for dinner and also my favorite restaurant in the city. Mama Zu is confident and sexy with zero pretension. When the food is this good you don’t need all the extra pomp and pageantry—the food speaks for itself. Mama Zu doesn’t take reservations. Show up around 8 or 9 and grab a table for two. Head to the back and select a bottle of wine from their shelf and check the chalkboard menu. It’s all delicious, but I recommend the parmesan eggplant.     Let’s go out. Where should I go for night out? If you’re looking for a club head down to Shockoe bottom where old factories have been repurposed into a stomping nightlife quarter. They’re all fun and kind of the same, but if I have to recommend one I would say The Tobacco Company is best. If Top 40 and Diplo isn’t what you’re looking for, try Balliceaux. Popular with the university crowd, Balliceaux usually has a DJ and plays some of the best music in the city. The bar is stylish and modern and the dance floor is always full of people. Pregame Balliceaux at Pie, a little hole in the wall bar just across the street.  Richmond has a great live music scene. Check out who’s playing at The National or The Camel. Shows usually aren’t sold out and tickets can be bought at the door. If you’re a jazz fan I suggest heading over to Emilio’s Tapas Bar on Friday night around 10 and hearing Lady E sing. Her soulful vocals will blow you away.         Wow, it sounds really cool, how do I get there? Richmond is located in the center of the state and is serviced by Richmond International Airport. Non-stop flights to Richmond can be found from Chicago, New York, Boston, and Atlanta. Richmond is also easily accessed by train. There are two Amtrak stations in Richmond, Main Street Station downtown and Staples Mill Station a bit further out. Both stations connect to the Northeast Regional train line that runs daily from Boston to Newport News. Richmond is a six hour train ride from New York City, three hours from Philadelphia, and one and a half hours from Washington, DC.  Getting around the city is very easy with hundreds of Ubers circulating around town at all hours.   A ride from uptown to downtown is no more than eight dollars."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-portland-maine/,usa,"What makes Portland, Maine a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? When most people think of Portland they think of the other Portland. Portland, Maine is the original Portland first settled by the English in 1623. And we’re way cooler. I mean… we have lobster. Fun Fact: Two men, Asa Lovejoy and Francis Pettygrove, founded Portland, Oregon. Lovejoy was from Massachusetts thus he wanted to call the new settlement “Boston.” Pettygrove, a native Mainah, wanted to call it “Portland.” The two men flipped a coin and Pettygrove won. So, obviously, we are cooler than Boston too. Wicked cool. Portland is the perfect travel destination for a wide range of travelers. We have something for everyone. Portland is a foodie town. In fact Portland constantly ranks as one of the best food cities in America because of its restaurant scene. Many chefs have left cities like New York and San Francisco to open a restaurant in Maine. Not to mention we have lighthouses, sandy beaches, beautiful mountains, and more L.L. Bean boots than you can want just a short drive outside the city. What 5 star hotel is the best in Portland Maine? Up until a few years ago Portland had a hotel crisis. The city didn’t have enough hotel rooms to accommodate the number of visitors. Several new hotels have been recently built in the Old Port, the city’s historic commercial center. The hot new hotel in town is the Press Hotel , a hotel built in the former Portland Press Herald building. The hotel opened last May as a luxury hotel with a newspaper theme. You’ll find vintage-looking desks, typewriters, and newspapers throughout the hotel and even the hotel logo is designed to resemble typewriter keys. What about boutique hotels in Portland Maine, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? If you’re coming for the true Maine coast experience then Black Point Inn , located just 15-minutes from downtown Portland is a luxurious option. Each of its 25 rooms is quintessentially Maine and the perfect romantic getaway. While you’re there, check out American painter Winslow Homer’s artist studio just steps away. The Gulf of Maine contains 365 islands, which are often called the calendar islands. Remember that for Jeopardy, okay? Over 100 of those are located close to Portland. Peaks Island is the most popular island destination that is just a quick ferry ride away. If you’re looking for a true boutique Maine experience, stay at the Inn on Peaks.     Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Portland? Portland is a great city for food, craft beer, and the arts, but if you’re looking to for true adventure then you need to head outside the city. Maine has some great hiking within an hour of Portland . Pack the car with a picnic basket and head for the local mountains to spend some time in nature and enjoy our state tree, the pine tree. Maybe you’ll be lucky and see a moose! Looking for even more adventure? Mount Katahdin, Maine’s tallest mountain and the end of the Appalachian Trail, is about a 6 hour drive north from Portland. Trust me, it’s worth the drive! During the winter months both nordic and alpine skiing and snowboarding is very popular at Sunday River and Sugarloaf Mountain. Head to Pineland Farms for the best local cross-country skiing. Curious where exactly our famed lobster comes from? Take a Maine Lobster Tour through Lucky Catch for a unique Maine experience.     Where are the best hangouts during the day in Portland Maine? If you are in town on a Saturday you need to walk through the weekly Farmer’s Market in Deering Oaks Park. Farmers from all over Maine come to sell their fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and berries. Next, take a short drive to Cape Elizabeth to Fort Williams Park. Here you can see Portland Head Light, the most photographed lighthouse in America that was commissioned by George Washington. Grab a lobster roll at the Bite into Maine food truck and finish it off with our famous whoopie-pies. There are many beaches located just outside of Portland. Scarborough Beach is a wide family-friendly sandy beach popular with locals and tourists alike. Get there early, as parking is limited. If you’re looking for the true tourist experience, head to Old Orchard Beach, a favorite summer spot for French Canadians. Hop on the roller coaster, play games at the arcade, work on your tan on the beach, and stuff your face silly with pier fries and fried dough. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Portland Maine and what are their best dishes? Portland has it all – from our world-famous lobster to Thai to fine French and Italian restaurants. We have a bit of everything at everyone’s budget. My favorite restaurant is Boda, an authentic Thai restaurant. The place is popular so expect to wait for a table, but the food is worth the wait. From delicious pad thai to quail eggs to sticky rice, you can’t go wrong. If you’re looking for something upscale then head to Fore Street of Street &amp; Co, but make sure you make a reservation in advance. Vinland is a popular restaurant that only makes food from local Maine ingredients so you can bet lobster is on the menu. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Portland has some great cafes with yummy pastries, but if you’re looking for dessert, either gelato or donuts are the way to go. Check out either the Holy Donut or Tony’ Donut. Definitely try the Maple donut at Tony’s. Yum! Gorgeous Gelato and Gelato Fiasco are located across from each other on Fore Street and both have delicious and rich gelato. Some people prefer one to the other, but personally I believe any gelato is good gelato. Give them both a try. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Portland Maine? The Old Port is full of cute shops containing anything from clothes to housewares to trinkets. Bliss Boutique is my favorite shop where you can find labels like Citizens of Humanity, Prairie Underground and Frye. Looking for something local – check out Sea Bags and Alaina Marie for fashionable Maine bags. Kennebunkport is also a charming seaside town located about 30 minutes south of Portland with great shopping. Of course, if you come to Portland you need to drive the 20 minutes north to Freeport to visit the L.L. Bean flagship store and the amazing outlet shops like J. Crew, Ralph Lauren, and more.  What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Portland? Nine Stones Spa has some of the best massage and ski care packages north of Boston. Their staff is friendly, helpful, and very professional. The spa itself is very tranquil making it the perfect spot to relax and unwind. Portland has many salons, but my favorites have always been Head games, Akari, and J. Kelley Salon. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? For the best view of Portland head to the Top of the East for a cocktail and enjoy the views of the city and Casco Bay. However, the best sunrise in Maine is a top Cadillac Mountain in Bar Harbor, which is about 3 hours north of Portland. Acadia National Park is one of the oldest national parks in the country and a great place to spend some time. So after Portland head north. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Not only is Portland a very foodie city, it is ranks as the top city for the number of breweries per capita beating out even the other Portland. If craft beer is your thing then Portland, Maine should be at the top of your list. You can easily spend the day brewery hopping on your own or take the brewery tour through the Maine Brew Bus. My favorite local brew is Allagash Belgian White. And definitely check out Maine Mead Works for delicious mead. You can beat the lavender lemonade! Portland has a wide range of bars from total dive bars to upscale cocktail bars. Most of the bars are concentrated in the Old Port, but several are located up the Peninsula. If you’re looking for a cool laid-back vibe then head straight to Novare Res, the local beer garden showcasing local Maine brews and European beers, or Bramhall Pub, where Maine’s best bartender mixes and stirs all sorts of fabulous concoctions. Looking to relive your early 20s? Head to Amigos or Bonfire. The best cocktails can be found at either the Portland Hunt + Alpine Club or the North Point.     If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Well, Portland doesn’t really have fancy clubs, which is one of the many things I love about Portland. You won’t find us wearing expensive heels and designer dresses. We prefer jeans and a flannel shirt. But, if you insist…. The Pearl is popular amongst the newly minted 21 year olds and has a bit of a dress code. My favorite is the Oasis. It’s totally down-to-earth and you can order bucket size drinks and play giant jenga. Oh, and the music is pretty good too."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-big-island-of-hawaii/,usa,"I wanted to give some input on the Big Island of Hawaii since I have come here every year for about 20 years. I started off going on business trips for my dad’s insurance conventions and spent one week each year with the same group of kids.  I have such fond memories of playing Hide and Go Seek in the hotel and eating tons of food at the fancy insurance parties every night. When I travel to the Big Island now, I am filled with nostalgia.  It has become a sort of sanctuary for my family and me as we relish old memories and try to make new ones.  That’s the beauty of the Big Island…you really feel like it is your second home. What makes the Big Island of Hawaii a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Glamour often refers to beauty, and it’s pretty hard to find anywhere with more spectacular vistas than the island of Hawaii, or the Big Island. Built on miles of barren lava rocks, the Big Island is made up of stunning beaches, mountain scenery, almost outer space-like lava fields and the warm ocean waters.  There are very few places in the world where the most stressful aspect of your day is whether or not you want a Mai Tai or Pina Colada lying by the ocean and if you would like seared ahi or mahi mahi for dinner.   What 5 star hotel is the best in the  Big Island of Hawaii ? The hotel with the best reputation on the Kohala Coast is definitely the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai .  They have everything from a manmade tide pool, to snorkeling classes, and a cultural center where you can make leis and learn about Hawaiian culture. What about boutique hotels in the Big Island of Hawaii, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? No question if you are looking for something other than a chain hotel, you either choose the Mauna Lani or the Mauna Kea . These are both gorgeous, opulent resorts with fantastic beaches that bring the true feeling of old Hawaii to your experience. Unlike the Hilton, you don’t ride on a Disney-like boat or train to get to your room.  At the Mauna Lani, you actually walk through a lobby with sharks swimming by you in the indoor/outdoor ponds.  Fans of the Mauna Lani or the Mauna Kea have a secret understanding of what I call “Big Island fever.”  You get all the luxury of a five-star resort with an aloha feeling that you just can’t find anywhere else. Personally, I have stayed at the Mauna Lani every year since I was 11 years old.  While it is still a large resort, I feel very much at home here upon arrival.  I know Pamela at the front desk whose nephew plays for the UCLA football team, Martin the fish feeder, and many others.  The best part about this hotel is that they  have a fabulous beach and free lounge chairs and it isn’t overcrowded like some hotels where you have to wake up at 7 AM to reserve a spot near the ocean. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler on  the Big Island of Hawaii? For the more adventurous traveler, I would highly recommend zip lining, touring the island on a helicopter, and driving a jeep up to the top of Mauna Kea.  There are a multitude of water sports to partake in as well.  However, there are also a plethora of activities available for the more cautious traveler who may just want to spend a day away from the lounge chair he/she has been sitting on for the past week.  And if you can’t bear to part ways with that chair, I completely understand! My favorite activity on the Big Island is called Flumin Kohala .  It is incredibly unique in the sense that you kayak through a man-made “ditch” or aqueduct that was drilled over a century ago.  The history, scenery, and adventure all combine to make an unforgettable experience.  Another place I recommend visiting is the Pu’uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park.  That may be a mouthful to say, but very few people are actually talking when you visit this national park also known as the “city of refuge.” Where are the best hangouts during the day in  the Big Island of Hawaii ? Since I usually end up spending the majority of the afternoon sitting on a lounge chair and then eating an extravagant meal for dinner, I always like to get up and do an activity in the morning.  Check out the Kona coffee tours at Mountain Thunder and then get your caffeine on with some legit Kona coffee.  It is also quite fun to drive into Kona and walk around the downtown area. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants on the Big Island of Hawaii and what are their best dishes?   My all-time favorite restaurant on the Big Island is Brown’s Beach House at the Fairmont Orchid.   It’s a hat-trick of a great dining experience – fantastic food, live Hawaiian music and a sunset that rivals most.  I advise you to check sunset times prior to your trip and make reservations for a table on the grass.  This is really true for all the top restaurants with an outside patio on the Big Island.  I don’t eat fish…I know who goes to Hawaii and doesn’t eat fish, so I will usually get some sort of filet and mashed potatoes combination.  Other great restaurants to check out are the Canoe House, Merrimans (where you can eat the flowers!), and Roys. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Hula Pie.  It’s a macadamia nut ice cream piled high on a chocolate cookie crust and topped with chocolate fudge and whipped cream.  Honestly, it’s pretty fantastic anywhere you go. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers on  the Big Island of Hawaii?   Every major hotel has their own shops nearby; my favorite shops can all be found at the King and Queen shops at the Hilton Waikoloa.  They have high-end luxury shops such as Tiffany and Co, Michael Kor’s and Louis Vuitton as well as small artisanal shops and the occasional farmer’s market.  Shops at Mauna Lani  have lots of high-end stores as well as a great Tommy Bahamas for post-shopping lunch. If you’re getting an early start to your shopping, have coffee at Kimo Bean for some authentic Kona coffee. The Shops also have a free Hawaiian hula and fire dancing show that lasts about an hour and is better than most of the luaus anywhere in Hawaii.   What are a couple of the best salons and spas on the Big Island of Hawaii ? Every resort has incredible spas.  I had a massage at the Mauna Lani Spa and it was outside in a hut in a beautifully secluded garden area.  Any fancy resort that you go to on the Big Island will have a fabulous spa and what should hopefully be one of the best and most relaxing massage experiences of your life. Time for a great sunset view on  the Big Island of Hawaii … where would you go? I love being in the ocean and watching the sunset from the water.  You can always head to the beach which should be right outside your hotel and lay in a lounge chair with a glass of wine and watch the sunset.  At most resorts along the Kohala coast, they have a nightly torch-lighting ceremony at dusk where a man blows a conk shell and runs around to all of the tiki torches along the resort and lights them for the evening. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Nightlife on the Kohala Coast doesn’t exactly include your typical bars and nightclubs.  Instead, you will probably be sipping a very fancy cocktail as you listen to live Hawaiian music and watch a Hula dancer at your local hotel bar.  You could always head to Kona which is about a 30-45 minute drive from the Kohala Coast if you prefer more of a raucous nightlife experience, but after that 3-course meal, you are probably going to want to stay close to home."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-la/,usa,"What makes Los Angeles a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Los Angeles has everything any traveler could want. If you want the crazy life of the big city, LA has it. If you are looking for a more peaceful getaway in nature, it’s just a short drive away. You could literally go surfing in the morning and then hit up the slopes of Mountain High by the afternoon. When I first moved to LA, I was very skeptical, but that soon went away once I realized how much this city has to offer. What 5 star hotel is the best in LA? I’m a sucker for history, so my top choice for a 5 star hotel would be the 100 year old Langham Huntington in Pasadena . It might be a little bit of a drive from LA proper, but it’s well worth it. The Langham was built in a time when some of the top architects lived in Pasadena. To call it just a 5 star hotel is cutting it short. The Langham is a grand hotel. It has 2 historic ballrooms, a beautiful courtyard garden (perfect for afternoon tea), a cocktail lounge reminiscent of the 1920s, and one of the best wood fired steak houses I have ever tasted. There are around 400 rooms to stay in ranging from a more than average guest room to private cottages all the way to your very own 2 story penthouse suite. Check here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in LA, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? My recommendation for a boutique hotel is more on the trendy side. It might not be my top recommendation for my parents, but I would absolutely send my sister or friends to the Standard Downtown . I spent many hours at the Standard, and I love this hotel. The rooftop bar is the perfect hangout during those hot summer days or even at night once it cools down. Where else can you watch movies projected on the neighboring building while swimming in a pool that over looks the lovely LA skyline?  I’m not good at ping pong at all, but I definitely gave it my best try at the Spin club on the 2 nd floor, and the food and drinks at both bars at pretty tasty. If you’re a whisky fan, I recommend the Dickle Pickle. The rooms at the Standard are well….standard but with a crisp, clean modern twist. The bathrooms are pretty sexy too! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in LA? Where do I begin with this. LA has so much to offer for anyone looking for adventure. There are whale watching boats that go out daily during the peak season. Some of them are quick trips, or you can find others that offer lunch and dinner. I am a big fan of scuba diving, and LA has a couple of the top sites in the world. The Channel Islands are perfect for anyone looking for a day trip. If you would rather dive during a weekend getaway, take the ferry to Catalina Island. You can rent gear on the island and walk right into the marine park near the old casino. One of my favorite activities to do during the summer is paddle boarding through Naples Canal (in Long Beach). Not only are you paddling through some of the coolest homes on the west coast, but you can also dock your board at the bars along the canal for a quick rest and a cocktail before paddling on. Hiking is another favorite activity of mine. Pretty much every week I would take my dog out exploring different trails around LA. You can find waterfalls, abandoned mines, hidden stairways, and even some mysterious structures. I would recommend either heading out the Angeles National Forest or up the cost to the Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades. If you don’t want to venture too far from the city center, Griffith Park has some good trails to check out too.     Where are the best hang outs during the day in LA? Once spring hits, my boyfriend and I would usually rent bikes and ride up the coast to the different beach bars. My personal favorite is Back to the Beach in Santa Monica. It is a good ride from Venice, and I am usually ready for a cold glass of bubbly once we get there. Another favorite place to hang out is the Malibu Winery. The winery is located in the mountains just east of Malibu. They have a huge lawn for their guest to set up picnics and live music is normally playing on the weekends. It’s the perfect getaway from the crazy city. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Los Angeles and what are their best dishes? I have to go back to the Langham Hotel for this one. Their wood fire steak house is called The Royce, and it is probably one of the best places I have eaten in LA. My boyfriend and I actually went there for our 1 year anniversary, and we still talk about it to this day. First, start off your evening with a little wine tasting while you wait for your table. As far as main course recommendations, I have a hard time thinking about what to recommend because honestly it was all soooooo good! I don’t think you could make a bad choice. One thing I will say is to be sure to save room for dessert and order the chef’s dessert sampler. I died when our plate came out! Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? My top place that I must take everyone who visits me in LA to is Fosselmans ice cream. This place has been making ice cream since 1919, and it is the absolute best ice cream you will ever taste. They only sell to select grocers and in limited flavors, so you’re better off going to the original shop in Alhambra. My personal favorite is the peppermint stick hot fudge sundae. If you are a little more health conscious, try out Café Gratitude or it’s sister restaurant Sage. Both have raw and vegan desserts that could satisfy even the biggest sweet tooth. At Café Gratitude, I would recommend the chocolate coconut cream pie, and at Sage, the raw brownie sundae. Both of these places are really good for dinner too. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in LA? I like checking out the shops on Melrose or Abbot Kinney. They are more boutique-like and you can find local designers. Art walks are all the rage in LA too. If you happen to be there while one is going on, I would say to check it out. Tons of local designers set up stands to sell their clothing or jewelry, and you can meet local artistians! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Los Angeles? For a good spa day, go to a Korean Spa. My top 2 recommendations would be the Wi Spa or the Olympic Spa. You can spend all day soaking in the different temperature pools or sweating in the saunas. If you want more, both places offer facial and massage treatments. Time for a great sunset view in LA… where would you go? LA has no shortage of great sunsets. If you are along the coast stop off at any of the restaurant/bars along the PCH in Malibu. Most of them have balconies right over the water where you can sip cocktails and watch the sky turn beautiful colors of red, purple, and blue as the sun fades beyond the horizon. If you are more inland, head up to the observatory in Griffith Park. You can catch the sunset and then look at the stars and planets through their mega telescope. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. My all time favorite place to go for after work drinks is the Culver Hotel. It’s another historic hotel in LA having been the housing for all the actors in Wizard of Oz. Their main lobby is set to look like an old library. Silent movies are projected on the wall and live big band jazz starts at 7pm. I’m big on dirty martinis, and the Culver Hotel makes one hell of a martini! If you need something a little fruitier, I would recommend the Culver Lemonade. At 7, they also open up the Velvet Lounge on the second floor. It’s just what it sounds like, a lounge full of velvet furniture, but you can have a more intimate drink up there since everyone else is usually downstairs. You also get a nice view of Culver Blvd. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Hands down the Edison downtown. You can probably tell by now that I like the more vintage places. The Edison is a speakeasy that was built in an old Edison electric building underneath some shops and apartments. All of the old equipment is still intact and is being used as tables and decoration. They too project silent and shadow movies on the walls. Bands and burlesque dancers perform on the weekends. If you’re lucky, you might even be there when the areal performers put on a show."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-kihei/,usa,"What makes Kihei a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?

It was my first time living alone. I also didn’t know anyone in North Carolina. It was the best thing I could have done after graduation, although I will admit it wasn’t my first choice. I wanted to be in NYC. When I wasn’t accepted into the NYC internship for ICU nursing, I was bummed because I had a decent resume.  I had planned on going there with one of my best friends, Ann. She is there now, already in grad school. Go Ann! Looking back, Charlotte was small enough that after a year I was ready to move on. Had I been in NYC I might not have quit my job when I did. Everything happens for a reason… I should learn to accept that! I hate to just give tour guides of everything you should see/do in a city so I’m just going to share my favorite things about Charlotte , and which places I would go if I had only a few days there to visit. Keep in mind I cannot even begin to go to all the great bars in restaurants in 4 days, so there is so much I wish I could add, but no one wants to read that much. If I had a weekend in Charlotte I would… First, I would go to NoDa (North Davidson St., the “artsy neighborhood”) and eat at Cabo Fish Taco , because it is my favorite restaurant EVER. There is no better Mexican place in Charlotte. I would wander around the shops while I waited for my table (there is always a wait). Look in Pura Vida Wordly Art, but… don’t buy. I’m sorry, but it’s so overpriced! The items have been imported from all over the world; they are authentic, but unless you know where that money is going, don’t spend so much. Most likely, it’s going in the pocket of some exporter, rather than the locals that made the handicrafts. Do go into Ruby’s gifts . She has pieces from artists in Charlotte, jewelry and art, and all of it is beautiful! Another great restaurant/bar in NoDa is Growler’s Pour House . Such a good salad, and coming from me (my favorite food is hotdogs and hot pockets, that’s saying something). They use old doors as tables… very clever. They are one of the many places in Charlotte with craft beer. Beer is huge in Charlotte, and I don’t mean Bud Light. There are microbreweries all over the place and everyone is sippin’ on blueberry beer or some other concoction. Other things I like about NoDa – they have a dog bar for your pups, VBGB (makes their own beer) where you can play Jenga and eat soft pretzels and cheese, Amelie’s French Bakery, and a studio for Silk Aerial, which I started to really enjoy while I was there. Soul Gastrolounge is SO good.  It’s located in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Food is pricey, but tapas always are. Go with a group so you can try a little of everything, and make sure you pick a night they have live music! Honorable mention in Plaza Midwood : Zada Jane’s, Intermezzo, the Common Market, and Dish (which was featured on Food Network). Back in Uptown.. the area where I used to live, everything is within walking distance. I would have lunch at either Alexander Michael’s for a burger, or a gyro Little Village Grill near my apartment. I would have dinner either at Nikko’s Japanese or Rock Bottom Brewery. I couldn’t leave without stopping in at Dandelion Market on a Friday night, and then head to the EpiCentre to my favorite bars: Connelly’s, Mortimer’s, Blackfinn, Prohibition, and end at Suite .  The epicenter also has some of the best restaurants, bowling, clubs, frozen yogurt, shops, and basically anything else you’re looking for. Other great bars in Uptown: Whiskey River , which is owned by Dale Earnhardt Jr. Speaking of Dale, you really should see a NASCAR race while in Charlotte. I was lucky enough to see one last year! Also, Howl at the Moon , a fun little piano bar. Also in Uptown: Alive After 5. This is a giant rooftop party on Thursdays that will start once spring really takes off. It’s lots of fun, there are great deals on drinks, and you’ll meet loads of new people. For music I would hope that someone was playing at the Fillmore or Amos’ Southend. This is where I met G. Love and partied on his tour bus! Many performers go out in Charlotte after they play. Sometimes concerts are held at the NC Music Factory, or at Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre , where I saw 2 Chainz, Drake, and J. Cole. You have to try BBQ while in Charlotte, and my go-to was Mac’s Speedshop . If you have time to shop, you have time go to SouthPark Mall , my favorite mall in Charlotte. There are also outlets, REI, and other malls North of Charlotte on 77 worth a visit and some of your hard earned cash. Take a trip to Asheville, to the Biltmore, where the movie Richie Rich was filmed. It’s surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains and has breathtaking views. Another day trip option is Lake Norman for some Bloody Mary’s and boating fun! Even after a year, there are SO many places I didn’t make it to! If I had a week to go back I’d try somewhere new that I missed while I lived there. I’d finally make it to the U.S. National Whitewater center, where people train for competing on rapids, and other people just have fun on them. I’d grab dinner at Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, or a BBQ lunch at Pinky’s Westside Grill. Also, Mert’s is well known for Southern food and I never got around to trying it.  So, those are my favorite places in Charlotte (other than my best friend Britani’s couch, were we watched so much Homeland while she made us lamb chops, and of course I loved my backyard pool at Post Gateway). Charlotte is the land of beautiful people inside and out. Plus, southern cooking never hurt anyone (except for all my heart patients at CMC). You can lay by the pool through Thanksgiving, and hang out all around the city tailgating for the Panthers games. I’m a huge fan of the eating that’s involved with tailgating. I’ve been told some people go to the game after. Just writing this post made me miss Charlotte and all the people that made it so special. And all of the food. I just can’t express How. Good. The. Food. Is."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-philadelphia/,usa,"What makes Philadelphia a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Philadelphia is the under the radar gem of a destination for those seeking a new experience in food, drink, art and history. With neighborhood festivals such as South Street, a July 4 th Welcome America celebration and the renowned Philly Beer Week you can join Philly locals enjoying the city. For art, there is the not to be missed Barnes Collection, Mural Arts and Magic Gardens. Often overlooked in the New York to D.C. road trip, the city offers a lot that will surprise you.   Just remember to bring stretchy pants to cheat on your diet because temptations abound! What 5 star hotel is the best in Philadelphia? Philly is a great town but right now, I’d say the city has a great line up of 4 star hotels (until the Four Seasons returns in 2018 occupying the top floors of the new Comcast Center).  What about boutique hotels in Philadelphia, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? I stay in Philly when I want a night out with friends and I usually stay at the Hotel Palomar or the Sofitel Philadelphia in Rittenhouse Square.   Two new boutique hotels both with rooftop bars are Hotel Monaco , in the Historic Old City and The Logan Hotel on the Parkway. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? The Mural Arts Tour is a favorite way to see the city – pick a walking tour, trolley tour or the Love Letter tour via the El(evated Train). You can bike, hike or run the many trails from the city all the way out to Valley Forge National Park and beyond. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Philadelphia? Summer welcomes Spruce Harbor Park, the waterfront pop up park as well as a few beer gardens and Center City Sips, a Wednesday night summer happy hour with drink specials, music and outdoor fun. We have bike trails, running trails, parks for people and parks for dogs.   The nearest beach is an hour away at Atlantic City and the South Jersey shore with towns such as Ocean City, Avalon and Cape May – these are the beaches that many locals go to every weekend in the summer. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Philly and what are their best dishes? This one is tough as there are so many awesome restaurants in the city.   With the crazy Pennsylvania liquor laws, you will find a large number of BYOBs in Philly – small restaurants producing amazing tastes that you can bring your own bottle of wine (or tequila) to celebrate with. We have famous chefs Marc Vetri (Vetri Ristorante), Michael Solomonov (Zahav, Dizengoff and Federal Donuts to name just a few of his restaurants).   We have restaurant collections from Stephen Starr (Parc, Barclay Prime, Buddakan, El Vez, the Dandelion, Talula’s Garden are a few favorites in his collection of nineteen restaurants),   Chef Jose Garces (Amada, Village Whiskey and Tinto in his collection)   and Chef Marci Turney (Barbuzzo, Little Nonna’s and Bud &amp; Marilyn’s to name just a few of her restaurants). Two Restaurants on Passyunk Avenue in South Philly, each with one name, Laurel and Will, are serving tasting menus to satisfy your inner foodie.   In the city, Vernick is another foodie paradise. I could go on and on if your date night wants to be food trucks, food festivals or diners – Philly has it all to make any date memorable, tasty and glamourous. This being Philly, we also do cheesesteaks and soft pretzels very well and those paired with a craft beer or whiskey can also be quite romantic. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? The desserts in Philadelphia are the reason I have a gym membership in the hopes to negate the (way too many) indulgent calories that the local pastry chefs tempt me with. I love the research to find the best dessert, these are my favorites so far (many ship in the U.S.!) Metropolitan Bakery – the Sour Cherry Sea Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie Barbuzzo – the Salted Caramel Budino Capogiro – Small batch artisanal gelatos and sorbets Hope’s Cookies at the PA General Store in Reading Terminal John &amp; Kira’s handcrafted chocolates and artisan candies Asher’s Chocolate Covered Pretzels The dessert cart at Davio’s, the secret macarons at Parc and the seasonal desserts at White Dog Café are a few restaurant favorites.

Classic Philadelphia boutiques for the best dressed and access to a variety of designers is Boyd’s, Knit Wit, Sophy Curson, Joan Shepp and Nicole Miller.  Other boutiques on the scene are Skirt, Adresse, Commonwealth Proper (for men), Per Lei, Arcadia Boutique, Third Street Habit, Vagabond, Barney’s Co-Op and Charlie’s Jeans.  For Shoes, Bus Stop in Manayunk is the go to on trend for shoes. For Jewelry, Lagos is locally made and has many statement pieces (I have a necklace from the Philadelphia collection which has architectural details from the city) What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Philadelphia? Rescue Rittenhouse is a great day spa with everything you need to decompress and/or prepare for a night out.   When you step off the elevator, your stress instantly melts away at this spa. Time for a great sunset view in Philadelphia… where would you go? High above the city on the 57 th floor is the newly opened One Liberty Observation Deck From street level, go to the Philadelphia Museum of Art entrance facing Boathouse Row or find a spot along Kelly Drive and the Schuylkill River. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Hidden on a side street is Vesper Club for cocktails and if you have the secret word, you can dial the phone to gain entrance to the basement bar which is private with no cell phone signal to allow you to enjoy the conversations and the drinks without worry. As a sports crazed city, the pre-game or game time spot is Chickie’s &amp; Pete’s sports bar for crab fries with your beer.   For international games like soccer, Fado Irish Bar is the go to spot.

Keep on reading to see what it has to offer you! What 5 star hotel is the best in Oakland? Waterfront Hotel is located on the Oakland waterfront and it’s the best due to its location, courteous staff, and spacious rooms with views of the San Francisco Bay. Its close proximity to Jack London Square’s fine dining, cinema, and nightlife combined with the kayaks and boats available on your doorstep make it a destination hotel. image source:  Gabriel Millos Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? For the caffeine addict, I would highly recommend taking a tour of the cult favorite, Blue Bottle Coffee, at their Oakland location. The tour comes with a private tasting so you can sip their delicious coffee and learn more about the roasting process at the same time! For those seeking more adventure, you can venture out to Lake Merritt and take a gondola ride or rent your own boat. Where are the best hang outs during the day in  Oakland? To hang out in Oakland, I’d recommend heading over to Lake Merritt where you can relax on the grass or take a walk around the lake. If you’re looking for something indoors, you can go to Awaken Café, which offers craft beer, wine, and coffee. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Oakland and what are their best dishes? With Oakland being such a foodie city, it’s difficult to choose just a few restaurants that offer delicious food. If I had to choose, I would recommend Homeroom for their bomb mac n’ cheese options, the sampler at the Laotian restaurant Champa Garden, or buttermilk fried chicken at Hopscotch. all three photos above via  Tony Webster Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? After a day of exploring, you might be craving something sweet. Head over to Fenton’s to get a sundae (this is the ice creamery/restaurant featured in the Pixar movie Up) or attempt the Split Challenge, where you try to finish the Banana Special and if successful, you win a shirt and bragging rights! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Oakland? If you’re a shoe addict like me, you can visit SoleSpace, which offers premiere lifestyle footwear and also doubles as an art gallery and holds events for the community like album release mixers. If you’re looking for unique home décor, you can visit Atomic Garden which is located in North Oakland. Esqueleto offers stylish, one-of-a-kind jewelry and just might have that necklace you’ve been searching everywhere to get! If you’re in the market for a new pair of denims, you’re in luck! Maple Street Denim is a locally owned, independent, woman-owned business. Their focus on quality and fostering personal relationships with their customers sets them apart from your typical department store shopping experience. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Oakland? When the mood to get pampered strikes, I like visiting Bisou Nails in North Oakland. They use completely natural and organic products and are known for their excellent gel nail art and custom designs. In addition to manicures and pedicures, they also offer eyelash extensions and waxing. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? For the best sunset view, I would head over to the neighboring city of Berkeley and head to the Lawrence Hall of Science. From its vantage point high above the hills, you can see stunning sunsets and I’ve had many good conversations/Instagram photos from this spot. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. A great place to go for drinks, especially for you beer lovers, is The Trappist. They have an excellent selection of beers, ranging from Belgian, local, to specialty micro brews from the U.S. Another great place to grab some drinks is Make Westing, which is a gastro pub that also offers two indoor bocce courts. It’s located right next to Fox Theater, which makes it a perfect place to pregame before catching a live show. If you end the night at a fancy club in Oakland, which one do you head towards? For a luxurious night, I like to head toward Yoshi’s. Yoshi’s is one of the world’s most respected jazz venues and features a state-of-the-art sound system. It also has delicious Japanese cuisine and specialty cocktails, making it a perfect place to relax and enjoy yourself. Heesun spends a ridiculous amount of time thinking about eating pho in Vietnam, swimming under the waterfalls in Thailand, and temple hopping in Cambodia."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-memphis/,usa,"What makes Memphis a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Memphis has a [well-earned] rough-and-tumble reputation, and we are pretty proud of our “grit and grind” lifestyle, but there are also a number of sights, landmarks, and restaurants for visitors looking for something a little nicer. And the best part about Memphis is that it is still very affordable, so you can enjoy a fancy holiday without breaking the bank. What 5 star hotel is the best in Memphis? The Peabody has long set the standard for luxury in Memphis. With its beautifully ornate lobby and gorgeous rooms, it’s a wonderful hotel right in the heart of downtown Memphis. Not only do you get luxury, but you are also walking distance to delicious restaurants as well as Beale Street. And as an added bonus, you can watch the iconic Peabody ducks make their famous walk in the morning and evening, but get there early, because it gets crowded! In 2015 Bass Pro Shops opened their newest store in the renovated Pyramid downtown. In addition to the retail shop, a number of restaurants, and the nation’s tallest free-standing elevator, it also boasts the Big Cypress Lodge. Each room has a Jacuzzi, and according to Holly Whitfield, author of the ILoveMemphis blog, the service is outstanding. Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Memphis? Shelby Farms Park, the largest urban park in the country, has a number of outdoor activities for travellers looking to enjoy some fresh air. You can rent a paddleboat and paddle around the park, or you can take advantage of the Greenline and walk, run, or cycle your way from the park all the way to Midtown. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Memphis? Memphis is synonymous with music, having launched the careers of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Isaac Hayes, among numerous others. You can visit Graceland and learn about Elvis’ life and career; you can tour Sun Studio and learn about how Sam Phillips discovered so many of our iconic musicians; and you can head over to the Stax Museum of American Soul Music to learn about how Memphis gave birth to soul music. Everywhere you turn in the city you will see the influences of these musicians and so many more, and all three museums are worth a visit to learn about Memphis’ contribution to music. If you are pressed for time, Backbeat Tours offers an awesome Extended MoJo tour to give you a crash course in Memphis history. The street art scene in Memphis has exploded in the last few years, and there are now a number of murals all over the city. If you have a car, challenge yourself to seek out as many of these murals as you can – the ILoveMemphis blog has a map of many of the murals, and the Memphis Art Project [started by students at my alma mater!] have created an online database of all the street art, including locations and artist information. If you are feeling historical, take a tour through the National Civil Rights Museum downtown. The Lorraine Motel [where Martin Luther King, Jr, was assassinated] has been turned into a fabulous museum representing the history of civil rights in the United States. They recently finished a huge renovation, and it is well worth a visit. Café Eclectic and Republic Coffee – both located in Midtown – are great places to pass the time. Both offer delicious menus and free WiFi, so they are convenient if you are looking to get some work done in a pretty setting. If you want to be outside, you can head down to Tom Lee Park on the Mississippi River and wander along the famous bluffs, or you can wander around on Beale St – I kind of prefer it during the quiet hours of the early afternoon when I can chat with some of the restaurant, bar, and shop owners. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Memphis and what are their best dishes? Chef Kelly English has turned the food scene in Memphis on its head with his two delicious Cajun-inspired restaurants. Located next door to each other in Midtown, both Second Line [2144 Monroe Ave] and Restaurant Iris [2146 Monroe Ave] offer luxurious dining with a down-home feel. I have never been to Restaurant Iris myself, but I have it on good authority it’s a great place for a birthday, anniversary, or other celebratory dinner. I’m a big fan of Second Line – and their fantastic patio – and can never get enough of their besh bbq shrimp or their po’boys. They do great cocktails as well. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best dessert in Memphis? Muddy’s Bake Shop has hands-down the best cupcakes in the city. They are made fresh every day, and they have traditional as well as exotic flavours. Definitely worth a stop if you’re craving something sweet! Sweet Noshings is another great stop if you want to indulge your sweet tooth. They make a number of desserts fresh every day, and they also have a variety of candy as well as sweet and savory popcorns on offer. It’s not really sweet, but my favourite popcorn is their Memphis Mix – with a combination of barbecue and caramel, it tastes exactly how you would imagine Memphis would taste. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? This one is easy – the Mississippi River. There are parks all along the river that offer stunning sunset views. Take a blanket and some snacks and chill out for a while as you watch the sun set. If you want a rooftop view, head to the Peabody or the Madison hotels downtown or to the Bass Pro Pyramid – you can’t go wrong with the views offered at any of these locations. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. This one is also easy – Beale Street. Named America’s Most Iconic Street, Beale Street is chock full of bars and blues clubs, all of which feature live music. Step into BB King’s to hear local blues musicians, or head over to Silky O’Sullivan’s to enjoy a diver, say hi to the goats [yes, there are live goats on the patio], and listen to the dueling piano players. Other favourites include Alfred’s and Rum Boogie Café, and it’s always worth a stop in Handey Park to say hi to the artists and check out who’s playing. If you’re in the mood to dance, head over to Club 152. And when you need a midnight snack, Blues City Café is your go-to for the best ribs in the city. Beale Street has a little something for everyone, and it’s a great spot during the day and at night. Fun fact: Beale St is the only stretch in the entire state of Tennessee where it is legal to drink outside. So grab a drink from one of the roadside bars and stroll along while you enjoy the music pumping out of every club and restaurant. A personal favourite of mine is Earnestine &amp; Hazel’s, about a 5-minute walk from Beale Street. A former brothel, Earnestine &amp; Hazel’s is one of Memphis’ most famous bars, and it is widely known to be haunted by a few of its former inhabitants. The beer flows easily, the soul burgers are a must-try, and the jukebox will play the song you want before you even realize you want to hear it [ps – the jukebox is also haunted]. It is definitely worth a stop; just be sure to walk around upstairs as well! If you’re looking for something a little fancier, look no further than the cocktail bar in the lobby of the Peabody. Get dressed up, sip on a fancy cocktail, and enjoy the lovely sounds of the grand piano. And PS – if you’re in town during basketball season, the best thing you can do is head to the FedEx Forum and catch a Grizzlies game. Your entire Memphis experience will be rolled into 3 hours, and after the game you can walk over to Beale Street and continue with everything I just mentioned above. I promise you won’t regret it. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? It’s not fancy, but it’s very Memphis – at the end of the night, you head to Raiford’s. There’s a disco ball on the dance floor, the entire place is covered with smoke, and the dj is in his 70s. Dance the night away while listening to some of Motown’s greatest hits and revel in one of Memphis’ most iconic spots."https://hippie-inheels.com/little-guide-to-maui-2-weeks-maui/,usa,"Maui is a stunning island in Hawaii! I spent a few weeks in Hawaii and wrote a number of articles about my time, but wanted it to be kind of all together in one article.

Paia is the hippie town which starts the road to Hana and Makawao in the middle is cowboy land called “upcountry”. Kihei is touristy and has a bar area called  The Triangle.  I stayed in four different areas and wrote about that plus reviews of specific hotels: Guide to where to stay in Maui   (reviews of hotels near airport &amp; staying in a small house/apartment) Staying in Ka’anapali Maui at the Sheraton Paia Inn | A Hippie Chic Must in Maui Here are a couple of photos from “upcountry”: Renting a Car in Maui Once you figure out where to stay, you have to find out what you want to do with your time! Keep in mind that parking is really expensive, but so are Ubers and random taxis. We rented through Budget and actually didn’t take the car because it was so dirty. We used Dollar once and Thrifty once and it was fine. For the smallest “compact” car they have either little chevy’s or Mazda’s. Because we came from out of country without insurance, we needed to take out the full insurance. Keep in mind that you don’t have to do this through the company your rent from. Tip: If you rent from an international website, the name you enter has to be a FOREIGNER of the USA and the main driver. For example, Ben found a website in India, that was Indian. Luckily he is British, or our reservation wouldn’t have worked and we would have lost the money. If you want to see Maui in-depth, you need to rent a car! Plus, the road to Hana is one of the biggest attractions in Maui and you’ll need a car for that. Update: since writing this post, I have found rentalscars.com and use them since they compare all the other sites. Turn on your JavaScript to view content What to do in Maui There is so much to get up to and some that is very affordable, so that you’ll never go bored here. First up I’ll talk about adventure since I’ve already written about it. Check out: My Top 10 Adventure Activites in Maui (catarmarn sailing, zip-lining, and more!) and a detailed post on a helicopter ride over the island: Seeing the Island Differently with Air Maui Turn on your JavaScript to view content There were a few more things I wanted to try but didn’t have time. One was blown art classes at Hui No’eau visual arts in Upcountry and the famous  Elvis show . They also put on a show about Hawaii, but we’d already done the Luau so didn’t go. Another option is a day at the aquarium ( Ocean Center ) which is near Maalaea Port in the South. Tip: for something different drive NW from the airport- it’s a gorgeous ride but no cars like the road to Hana! On the way is a ranch called Mendes that has horseback riding. I didn’t have time to try! You can also see places they filmed Jurassic Park Beaches &amp; watersports: You’ll want to spend a lot of time at the beaches! On the North West you have Ka’anapali where all the fancy resorts are. This has some of the best snorkeling and is called “Black Rock”. We could see the catamarans come in to the rocks to snorkel from our hotel window. This is Ho’opika where they come to windsurf! The professionals come here and it’s the best in the world. This is the first stop on the Road to Hana, don’t miss it! you’ll see this view driving the southern route from the airport to Lahain a Money saving tip: Just hire equipment from a random place and bring it to Ka’anapali. You don’t have to be staying in a hotel to get to the beach, nor do you have to come on a big catamaran. Just walk on in! Makena beach above and below Down near Kehei, we searched for snorkeling and had no luck. Makena beach in Kehei is a shore break so you can’t even boogie board here without maybe getting an injury. It’s cool to come watch the locals skim board and boogie board here though because it takes so much talent to do. According to the lifeguard, they have neck and spinal injuries more often than you’d think. Also checked for snorkeling in Wailea, but couldn’t find anything worthwhile. Better to just go for Lahaina. Up near Paia, the water is rocky and a bit dangerous. You have to make sure to only go in water that has signage saying to do so, and never go in murky water. There was a shark attack one week before we went which was fatal. My surf instructor said he has seen two tigers while surfing. Spa treatments in Maui: Maui has amazing spas, most of which are located in fancy hotels. If you have a lower budget you can also get treatments at places which stand alone. I got my nails done at the Kaahumanu Queen Mall at Le’s Nails for $15 USD and it wasn’t great, ha but was cheaper than buying clippers, a file, and polish myself. I had a few massages (all in the name of research) and a facial which I wrote about here: Absolute Bliss at 3 Top Spas in Maui Secret local waterfalls: There are falls on the Road to Hana like Twin Falls which can be crowded. We had a local take us to some secret waterfalls. It was a little pricey, but worth seeing these cool spots that had NO tourists. We had the place to ourselves and could swim up to these waterfalls, swing on vines, and if you’re me- fall down and scrape your leg up. Be sure to wear mosquito spray. Having the “local secrets of Maui” is worth paying for a tour (if you can find one). You can ask around to surf instructors as they might do tours on the side. Getting off the beaten path in Maui is what we remember the most about our trip! Check out a luau: You can’t go to Maui and NOT see a luau. We went to Old Lahaina Luau which is the most famous in Hawaii and known as the best. There was free parking (rare in Hawaii) and we were greeted with drinks on entry. You’re free to wander and get photos will they prepare the pig, Hawaii style: The guys were funny and people were all crowded around taking photos with selfie sticks. After the big reveal, everyone chills and drinks until your table is called for food. There is SO much food it’s insane! Here are mine and Ben’s plates. There was the typical kalua pork, sweet bread, mahi-mahi Maui style, salad, Pulehu steak, rice, island style chicken, sweet potato, taro salad, more pork wrapped in banana leaf (laulau), veggies, ahi poke, and this yummy guava butter (so good). After dinner was served the Luau started. I was surprised it wasn’t just dancing and singing it was a story: the whole story of Hawaii and it was very cool. It was one of our favorite things looking back on the trip, that we did in Hawaii. With India being so conservative it was just refreshing to see another culture that is so open – didn’t hurt to look at all the eye candy either! Details: Old Lahaina Luau ,  1251 Front St, Lahaina, HI 96761, United States. Phone:+1 808-667-1998. You MUST make reservations in advance. Tickets are $109 USD. Food &amp; Shopping in Maui (By Area) Old Lahaina: There’s an outlet mall here. It was great but had Coach, Michael Kors, Gap, Tommy, Calvin Klein, and more. The main strip has lots of shops! My favorite was LUSH where I got solid shampoo and facial masks which are all natural. You can buy local art here. It’s quite pricey. Also at Island Sole you can get all brands of flip-flops. I got new reefs! Also famous: Lahaina Tub and Scrub . The main gelato shop wasn’t impressive, but the  Ululani’s Hawaiian Shave Ice  was so good and worth the wait. It’s the #1 place to eat in Lahaina and it’s just ice!! lol I got lemonade, fruit punch, and blue raspberry. Check out the Honolulu Cookie Company there are delicious samples so you can decide what to buy. To eat: Longhi’s, Spanky’s for live music and booze, Hard Rock Cafe, Cheeseburger in Paradise, Bubba Gump, Ruth Chris, and Lahaina Grill (famous &amp; pricey) which is right next to the Lahain Inn. Round Table Pizza delivers and was very good! cheeseburger in paradise Some hotels in Ka’anapali have shuttles to here. The luau I went to was here (information above). There is a HUGE Banyan tree, one of the biggest in the world in Lahaina. Don’t miss checking it out- but then it’s pretty hard to miss! Kehei: Check out the shrimp truck pictured below! The tacos were the bomb! The  triangle  is here. It’s called that I guess based on the Bermuda triangle, you drink and get lost in all these bars! Tiki’s Bar had really good live music and happy hour deals: Great spot to chill out and watch surfers and drink! There is shopping in the main area. It’s mostly self run shops like a market and I found a couple I loved. One was Re-Psyched “sea the beauty” where this girl was making designs from beachy stuff like shells and sea glass. I got a hook for keys made from driftwood and a seaglass magnet as my only souvenirs in Maui! that girls cute shop! Paia: I have a whole guide on Paia which includes best food and shopping. Make sure to check it out because some of our BEST MEALS were in Paia!! Guide to Paia Food and Shopping Makawao: Market Fresh Bistro was all I had time to try. If you’re going to Makawao for zip-lining which is why many go, head there early to explore the town. There are many cute shops in Makawao. I got a very cute druzy stone bracelet by Rue Belle at the shop Mercantile , which was a lot at $50 USD but it’s the only big purchase I made in Maui. There are about 10 shops all together. Give yourself about 1-2 hours here. Kahului: I won’t lie we spent a lot of time eating fast food while staying here! This is the airport area and it was kind of our relax and not play tourist place. sorry!!! but yes that’s me eating pizza hut, taco bell, and McDonalds. we had just landed from India! check out famous  Da Kitchen for local favorites. There is a famous ice cream place called Guri Guri , which only has two flavors. The mall here is Queen Kaahumanu Mall and it isn’t bad. There’s also a Target and Walmart if you need to stock up on things for say, a camping trip!"https://hippie-inheels.com/where-to-travel-in-arizona/,usa,"So you’ve seen the Grand Canyon. Now what? Mention Arizona to any traveler and the first thing to come to mind is the Grand Canyon. It’s big and kind of hard to miss after all. But one you’ve peered over the edge, taken a couple of panoramas, and maybe walked down into it a ways, you’ve pretty much done it. Get the postcard and get on your way. There are so many other places to see; so here’s where to travel in Arizona next! Where to Travel in Arizona (other than the Grand Canyon) Luckily there is way more to do in Arizona than the Grand Canyon.  Phoenix is a surprising cultural hub. From here, head north for a couple days and visit Acrosanti and Sedona, head west and visit Palm Springs and Coachella, head south and you’ll find Tucson and Tombstone, or just stay in town and explore some of the country’s best art festivals . Where to go in the North of Arizona Acrosanti Acrosanti  is an experiment in urban planning that uses innovative building techniques and city planning to explore new ways to increase metropolitan sustainability and reduce urban sprawl. Originally founded 1970 by the Italian architect, Paolo Soleri, the futuristic decor and original building styles are delightfully reminiscent of the Jetson-esque future imagined by 1950’s designers. To me, the style felt part space lab, part post apocalyptic utopia, and I loved all of it. A series of guesthouses provide a minimalist sleeping space that allows guests to fully immerse themselves in the Acrosanti experience.  I highly recommend visiting for a day, and staying for the evening. Take the tour, learn about their projects, and become inspired.  Dine in the cafeteria with the resident volunteers and imagine a better way to live. I highly recommend visiting for a day, and staying for the evening. Take the tour, learn about their projects, and become inspired.  Dine in the cafeteria with the resident volunteers and imagine a better way to live. Sedona Sedona is a quiet little desert town that makes a great place to rest, detox, and embrace the great out doors. Downtown Sedona is filled with art galleries, new age shops, and trendy restaurants.  Everywhere you look you’ll find stunning red rock vistas calling your name. Any visit to Sedona isn’t complete without a trek into the red rock buttes and canyons around the town.  There are probably hundreds of hiking trails to choose from. My favorite hikes included Devil’s Bridge Trail and West Fork Canyon.  Devils Bridge culminates at an impressive natural arch so large you can walk across it like a bridge. West Fork has over a dozen stream crossings, and stayed cool and shady in shelter of the cliff walls even in the heat of the day.  Pick up a good walking stick at the start of the trail. You’ll need it for balance! Where to go in the West of Arizona Palm Springs The Palm Springs/Coachella Valley area of California has become something of a mecca for festival-goers in recent years.  But no matter the season, Palm Springs is a town worth visiting. Like Sedona, it is known for its healthy mix of relaxing spas, healing springs, and the beautiful Sonoran Desert to explore. Go for a weekend. Spend the days hiking, biking, horseback riding, or off-roading the many trails in the Coachella Valley Preserve.  Come in the spring to beat the heat and enjoy the cactuses in bloom. There’s nothing quite like the sight of a brilliant flower blossoming on the spiky uninviting side of a cactus to make you respect nature’s will to thrive and survive. In the evenings soak your weary muscles in the desert hot springs, fed from an aquifer of mineral-rich spring water. Where to go in the South of Arizona Tucson Two hours south of Phoenix is Tucson and just a bit farther on is Tombstone.  Tucson is another serene desert town, nestled between several mountains and speckled with Saguaro cacti.  Wandering from one cute oasis town to the next, separated by lengths of highway and harsh desert landscapes, just doesn’t seem to get old no matter how many I visit. Tombstone But then Tombstone is another story all together. They’ve stuck close to their Wild West roots, and celebrate their colorful history everyday of the year with historically themed shops, galleries, museums, performances, tours, and more. If you like historical tourism, funny costumes, and celebrating the crazy history that brought us to where we are today; consider a visit to the Arizona Renaissance Festival too. Open in February and March, just east of Phoenix, its a silly way to spend a day recreating the best parts of Renaissance England (the beer, the food, the corsets, and the jesters!) The Arizona Renaissance Festival is a great place to go shopping too. Artisans and crafters fill the shoppes with their own unique crafts and works of art. But then, Arizona is pretty great at celebrating artists and small business owners.  The Tempe Festival of the Arts is one of the nations best and biggest art markets and well worth a visit.  Tempe also has monthly art nights every first Friday . These nights are a fun way to check out new local artists, buy some cool crafts, and try some new eats. Arizona has so much to offer other than the Grand Canyon! From art and culture to natural beauty, Arizona has plenty to offer. Visit for a day, a week, or a month. No matter how long you stay, there will always be something else you wish you’d seen, one more city you wish you’d explored and one more mountain you wish you’d climbed."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-providence/,usa,"What makes Providence, RI a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? After living in New York for a few years, we weren’t quite sure what to expect from Rhode Island and we were pleasantly surprised by the restaurants, arts scene and culture in Providence. They call it the “Creative Capital” for a reason. Providence has won all kinds of awards and is in the Top 3 in Travel + Leisure’s “America’s Favorite Cities” poll. Since it is only three hours from New York City by train and only an hour south of Boston, it really makes a perfect weekend getaway destination for anyone in the Northeast. What 5 star hotel is the best in Providence, RI ? The grand dame of hotels is the historic Biltmore Hotel , which is now part of Hilton’s Curio Collection and has been named a Historic Hotel of America. Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in Providence, RI , of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? There are a couple of boutique hotels, including the Hotel Providence , but the one that I’ve heard people coming to Providence just to check out this hotel is the Dean Hotel. It is very funky and eclectic and features a coffee café, karaoke bar, German restaurant and a super-sexy cocktail den. The rooms are also unique, some even with bunk beds for those traveling in groups. Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Providence? Providence is a bit more focused on culture than adventure, but you can do things like bike the East Bay Bike Path, or go sailing or rowing from the Community Boating Center. Theater fans should see what is playing at Trinity Repertory Company, Providence Performing Arts Center, or Columbus Theater. Music aficionados can get their classical music fix at The Vets, while rock and rollers can see who is playing at Lupos. The time to come to Providence though is during a Waterfire event, which happen from May through October and feature bonfires in the middle of the river, accompanied by music, street performers, artisans and food vendors. The luxury splurge there would be to take a gondola ride up and down the river during Waterfire. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Providence? Roger Williams Park just outside of downtown Providence offers a zoo, botanical gardens, natural history museum, pedal Swan boats, a carousel and more. I’d also recommend a stop into the RISD Art Museum (Rhode Island School of Design) and the Providence Athenaeum. If you time it right, there may even be a street festival going on where you might see someone working on a live mobile forge from the Providence SteelYard, see street performances by Providence’s Big Nazo life-size monsters, and other spectacles like the Bandaloops “dancing” down the outside of a building or see giant dinosaurs from street theater company Close-Act Theatre roaming the streets. You really never know what you will run across in Providence! If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Providence and what are their best dishes? My favorite is Bacaro, on South Water Street, which makes an incredible pasta with white-truffled scented egg. For a date night, I’d also recommend Capriccio for classic Italian; Mill’s Tavern for wood-grilled meats and fresh oysters; or New Rivers for New American cuisine. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Pastiche is one of the only desert-only places in Providence so while it is good, it can also get very crowded. I also love the Duck &amp; Bunny on Wickenden Street. This “snuggery” is tucked into a few rooms in a converted house and features tea, coffee, cocktails, crepes and cupcakes. Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Providence.  Who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  The main shopping street is Westminster, where you will find some specialty boutiques and shops featuring some of Rhode Island’s local designers and crafters, many of which are RISD graduates. I also enjoy the boutiques around Wayland Square and on Hope Street. You can also make some great finds at local street fairs and farmer’s market, like the farmer’s market in Lippitt Park on Saturdays in the summer or Hope Artiste Village in the winter. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Providence ? I would recommend either Strands or Femme Fatale in Wayland Square for salons and the best spa is The Spa at the Providence Biltmore. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? College Hill on the East Side of Providence is, as you would guess, on a hill, so can offer some great views across the downtown skyline. One good place to view a sunset would be Prospect Terrace Park. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. While the sun is still setting, I’d hit the Rooftop at Providence G, to get those great city views. After that, I’d head over to The Eddy, for another cocktail. Another of my favorite spots for drinks is The Avery, on the west side of Providence.   If you are a beer fanatic, head over to the Malted Barley on Westminster Street. They have 23 beers on tap and you can build your own flight, plus they have some amazing homemade soft pretzels. If you end the night at a fancy club in Providence, which one do you head towards? The college crowd will likely hit more of the clubs like The Hot Club, but we prefer something more subdued and upscale. The Dorrance is the place for specialty cocktails in an elegant setting."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-tulsa/,usa,"What makes Tulsa a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Tulsa is easy to get around and has all the makings of the dream glamor trip of a lifetime! Be pampered at the spa, slip into a marvelous outfit from a designer boutique, have dinner or a show and then hit the nightlife scene! Tulsa is fantastic. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? The historic Mayo hotel in downtown Tulsa is a treat. This art deco marvel was built in the heyday of the Tulsa oil boon and has hosted celebrity guests like Babe Ruth, Lucille Ball, and President John F. Kennedy (and The Educational Tourist!!) The Mayo offers what you would expect from a 5 Star swanky hotel – custom made linens in what the hotel describes are “102 ultra chic guest rooms”. Guest rooms are HUGE and ours was larger than my first apartment with a  full kitchen and living area in addition to the bedroom. Part of what makes the Mayo a step above is service. While waiting to check out of the hotel another guest was making reservations and giving detailed instructions for leaving rose petals on the floor and bed along with lit candles in the bathroom. It turns out they do this sort of romantic thing ALL THE TIME. Stay and dine at The Boiler Room which serves from breakfast till late night snacks. Or head to the roof for a fantastic view of downtown Tulsa and have a drink at the Penthouse Rooftop Lounge. Tulsa skyline image After a late night of fun, get your cup of Joe at the… Topeca Coffee Shop. Try the homemade pastry….calories don’t count while you are on vacation, right? What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Ambassador Hotel in downtown Tulsa was built in 1929. Think about that date..and remember that the country was in dire straights at that time and this was the top of luxury.  You’ll find all the usual – wifi, clean spacious rooms, and wonderful staff, but the real reason to stay at the Ambassador is the restaurant. The Chalkboard has taken ‘regular’ food and put a delicious twist on it. Try the pancakes – not the ordinary! If you are lucky enough to visit during the fall ask the bartender about the custom fall drink. It is brewed for weeks and is wonderful. The chefs and bartenders are always trying something new….and wonderful! The Chalkboard restaurant has a very hip feel to it. The art on the walls makes for interesting conversation! Where are the best hang outs during the day? Riverside park is a great hangout spot with miles of hiking and biking. When you get parched or famished, try the Blue Rose for food. Try the famous cheese fries! flowers image source If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Tulsa and what are their best dishes? My favorite is for Italian food lovers!  Villa Ravenna has amazing food in a romantic, candle lit atmosphere.  What to choose? Aragosta with Spaghetti? Bistecca alla Marsala – all fantastic, but do try the grilled pear gorgonzola, which is a specialty. For continental food try Flemings: Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar . Not only is the food magical and the atmosphere devine, but they have an award winning collection of wines they call “Fleming’s 100”. Describe what you like – bubbly and festive? fragrant and fruity? velvety and full bodied? Fill out the award winning custom iPad app called WiNEPAD to find the perfect wine! Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Antoinette’s Baking Company is located In Brookside and has THE most fantastic desserts. Ask around about everyone’s favorite and it will be a toss up between the Velvet Elvis ( banana cream pie with bacon, marshmallow, and peanut butter) and Versailles Pie (dark chocolate earl grey custard with lemon whipped cream). Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  Shopping in Brookside’s collection of boutiques in fun, fun, fun!  Try Shopgirls for a taste of the latest and greatest. You never know what you’ll find for trendy fun! Feel like hip and happening shopping? Head over to Ida-Red which is billed as “Tulsa’s Rocking Boutiqe”. Miss Jackson’s in Utica Square has been a staple of Tulsa shopping for 100 years. This department store is one stop luxury shopping. Enjoy the spa and have a make over before a big night on the town! A rare spot that not only stores and cleans your real fur coats, but if that coat is feeling out of style, you can make an appointment to have your coat restyled. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Tulsa? My favorite spa is Ihloff Salon and Day Spa in Utica Square. When you pass through the doors and put on a fluffy, cozy robe, you feel positively transported! Massages of all types are offered. I’d like to have one of each, please! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? For fantastic Japanese cuisine AND a great view of the sunset, then Zanmai is your spot. Located on trendy Cherry Street. Make reservations and dress in your night life clothes for fun! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks. For drinks, head to The Saturn Room which is the hip and happening tiki bar in Tulsa or Mixed Company Mayo and enjoy the views from the rooftop bar.  The drinks at the Mixed Company Mayo are amazing along with the names: Smoke and Mirrors, High Violet, and The Longest War."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-lake-tahoe/,usa,"What makes Lake Tahoe a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Lake Tahoe is so much more than just the stunning nature that it is famous for. The towns around the lake cater to every type of visitor, from families to campers to luxury travelers. If you are looking for a glamorous trip, Lake Tahoe is the perfect place to get cozy in a peaceful resort tucked away in one of the most beautiful natural environments on Earth. Lakeside fine dining, sunset boat cruises, and local boutique shops are just some of the highlights of you can expect from a trip to Lake Tahoe. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? The Ritz Carlton , without a doubt. Nestled amongst the towering pine trees, this luxury mountain resort features personal fire-places in each room, a spa and fitness center, a pool in the middle of the mountains, access to snowboarding and skiing in the winter, and access to hiking and beaches during the summer. They also have five unique dining options to choose from and fire pits next to which you can enjoy a delicious cocktail. It’s the kind of resort that you could spend your whole vacation in (not that I would ever recommend doing that). What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Honestly, I would recommend skipping the boutique hotels and looking into AirBnb and Vacation Rental By Owner (VRBO). Most of the cabins in Lake Tahoe are vacation homes. Whether you are looking for a small apartment or an entire luxury cabin to yourself, you can find it on these sites. This way you get the privacy of your own place and the luxury of the beautiful homes people have in Tahoe. Plus, staying in a rental cabin adds a nice homey feel to your vacation. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? Where to begin? Lake Tahoe is the perfect place for someone who wants to rest in luxury in the evening, but adventure nonstop during the day. Lake Tahoe is famous for its powdery snow, perfect for skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing. Still, don’t think of Lake Tahoe as a winter-only destination. During the summer you can go hiking, hang at the beach, or rent a boat, paddleboard, or kayak. Lake Tahoe is ideal for nature lovers as almost all the best activities are outdoors. Where are the best hang outs during the day? In summer, it’s all about the beach. King’s Beach and Sand Harbor are two of my favorite beaches on North Shore as they have a lot of shopping and dining options nearby, but they also have lots of water activities available. So you can lounge about and work on your tan, or you can rent a paddle board/kayak/boat/etc. and explore the unbelievably clear lake. In winter I recommend Squaw Village . Besides great access to the slopes, they have a massive ice-skating rink and a bunch of cute shops. It’s worth a visit just to sip hot cocoa next to one of the outdoor fire pits. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Lake Tahoe and what are their best dishes? One of the best ways to dine in Lake Tahoe is lakeside. One of my favorite lakeside fine dining restaurants is West Shore Café. The restaurant extends onto the pier, so you can dine by the water or even show up via boat. Their menu changes seasonally, but they have some of the best sweet potato fries I’ve ever tasted. I’m also a big fan of their seafood. Pretty much everything they make here is delicious. Make sure to start with their take on a Moscow Mule, the Meeks Mule.  For something a little more intimate, head to The Soule Domain. The cozy cabin makes a great date setting and the food is to die for. They even cater to vegans, so everyone can enjoy the mouthwatering meals here. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Okay, so this isn’t the most luxurious place to dine, but Mourelatos Cable Car Ice Cream is famous. There’s almost always a line and it is always worth the wait. However, if you are looking for sit-down service, head over to Jake’s on the Lake. Their hula pie is a meal of its own. It’s definitely meant to share. For those of you who don’t know, hula pie is a chocolate cookie crust with macadamia nut ice cream piled on top, covered with chocolate fudge, whipped cream, and macadamia nuts. I’m drooling just thinking about it. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? While there are plenty of cute shops around the lake, I would recommend heading to Truckee if you interested in serious shopping. Though the main street in Truckee is small, it is lined with great boutique shops. The shops in Truckee carry really unique items that you can’t find anywhere else. They also have a few shops filled with locally made goods. My favorite shops there are Artisan’s Market Place and Bespoke. Oh and the candy shop, of course. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Lake Tahoe? 1862 David Walley’s Hot Springs &amp; Day Spa is a little bit south of the lake, but it is worth the drive. For $50 you get full day access to the hot springs, steam room, dry sauna, and pool. Once you’re there you can also purchase spa treatments from their extensive list of offerings. Go during the weekend and you can enjoy poolside cocktails as well! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? There is nothing quite like sunset on the water. The Safari Rose is a two-hour sunset cruise around the lake that includes cocktails and appetizers. There is also the Tahoe Queen Dinner Cruise, which includes dinner, cocktails, and a sunset that will blow your mind. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Two of the most popular places to get drinks are Sunnyside and Lone Eagle . Sunnyside has a beautiful deck next to the lake while Lone Eagle has fire pits along the beach. You’ll notice there is a bit of a theme in Lake Tahoe… the closer to the lake the better. Another great place to drink by the lake is Gar Woods , where they are famous for the “Wet Woody”. In fact, they have an entire Wet Woody menu . There really is no better way to end a day in Tahoe than sitting by the lake and sipping a cocktail. Every time I’m there, I feel like I’ve found my own little slice of paradise."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-upper-west-side-nyc/,usa,"What makes the Manhattan a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Manhattan has some of the most beautiful, safest, and iconic streets in all of New York City. Most people know the Upper West Side as an affluent, intellectual, and cultural neighborhood. It starts at West 59th street and ends around West 110th Street, so it encompasses a very large portion of Manhattan. You’d need days to explore it fully! There is always something to do within the large compounds of this neighborhood. In case you didn’t know Jerry from “Seinfeld” lived on the Upper West Side. Other UWS residents include Ted from “How I Met Your Mother” and Miranda and Charlotte from “Sex and The City.” What 5-star hotel is the best in the Upper West Side? The Mandarin Oriental New York is one of the most high-end hotels you can get in the whole city.   It’s located at the top of the Time Warner Cable Center and is only one block from Central Park. All the rooms have a fantastic view of the New York City skyline. Click here for rates and availability.  For More Luxury Hotels in the UWS, check here. What about boutique hotels in the Upper West Side? Which would you, send your friends or family to stay at? This would have to be the Hotel Lucerne . I have never stayed here, but have always wanted to spend a weekend enjoying the area and stay here with my family and friends. The hotel is steps away from the Natural History Museum, which although touristy, is a must do in New York. The Lucerne is also located on the perfect street for brunch enthusiast. I would love to walk out of this hotel to go have Bloody Mary’s next door. Click here for rates and availability. Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Manhattan? I wouldn’t say that the UWS is the adventure capital of New York City. For an active day out I suggest renting a paddle boat and cruising in Central Park. For a real adrenaline rush in New York head south about 30 blocks to W. 29th St. and fly high with the Trapeze School New York. For more NYC activities, check Viator Where are the best hangouts during the day in Manhattan – (café, beach, or park)? Central Park starts at 59th street and ends at 106th street. Going to Central Park is a must for anyone visiting New York City. I love coming here just to sunbathe, people watch, and do some exercises.   However , there are beautiful gardens, a zoo, roller rink, ice skating rink, and, my personal favorite, volleyball courts. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Manhattan and what are their best dishes? We always took our date nights at Kashkaval Garden on 56th and 9th. It’s a quaint restaurant that doesn’t take reservations. They specialize in tapas and Mediterranean dishes.   We loved coming here to get red wine paired with a nice cheese and meat platter. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Hands down it’s  Magnolia Bakery . I could eat their banana pudding all day long (and deal with the stomach ache to follow). The bakery specializes in classic American desserts. You feel so warm and welcomed walking into Magnolia Bakery – and believe me that doesn’t always happen in New York City. Tell us about the trendy, upscale spots in Manhattan? Well, it’s New York City, so you can bet there are going to be some trendy spots. I loved walking around Lincoln Center, where you’ll see the world famous Metropolitan Opera.   Walk around here for a night to feel like high-class royalty. What are a couple of the best fitness salons and spas in Manhattan? Get your sweat on is Physique 57 on Broadway. It’s beautiful and is just so “New York.” You can even see high profile celebs have been seen burning fat and pumping iron. It’s close to Central Park too, so after a workout, you can head right to the park and be one with nature.  Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Riverside Park for fantastic views over the Hudson. I love watching the sun set here. Plus you get great views of New Jersey! Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. The The Empire Hotel Rooftop located at 44 W 63rd St. has great views, a fireplace, and a fabulous bar that is a perfect place to catch up with friends. If you end the night at a fancy club in The Upper West Side which one do you head towards? The Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola  at Lincoln Center where you can get the best jazz music all night long accompanied by soul food and drinks all around."https://hippie-inheels.com/gervasi-vineyard-villas-review-top-winery-ohio/,usa,"Gervasi Vineyard &amp; Villas Review (top winery in Ohio) If you wanted to visit one of the top wineries in Ohio, look no further than award-winning Gervasi Vineyard in Canton, Ohio. It’s won multiple awards to receive the honor and is also known to have the most luxurious villas in Ohio. I stayed with my mom for a night just recently. Here’s my review of Gervasi Vineyard. My stay at Gervasi Vineyards Gervasi winery is not just a vineyard but is a great place for fancy dinners, casual lunches, a setting for an Italian vineyard wedding setting, and for weekend getaways. We were set to do a vineyard tour! In the season, they have cooking classes as well you can look into. Gervasi Villas You do need to book ahead for these villas (you can use that link to book) as they fill up pretty far ahead of time. My mom is already about to call and book to go back with my dad! I stayed in the Sorrento villa. This is one which is a suite inside a house that has 4 suites in it. The suites have a shared common area which was no hassle at all, in fact it was nice to meet the other people staying there out on the balcony. Out in the common area was a kitchen with complimentary juice, tea, water, and yogurt (the nice brands too!). common area, plus living room not pictured Rooms are all decorated in Italian style, from the walls to the floor! The lighting fixtures, and every small touch in the room is Italian themed. Beds were super soft, towels warming on towel warmers, and there were robes and slippers.  In the mornings, they brought breakfast to the room in little wooden baskets that had sandwiches, quiche, and pastries. The coffee was in the common room were you could grab your other snacks and drinks from the fridge. I love not having to leave the room for breakfast.  The back porch opened to the lake which was nice (and a short cut to walk to dinner). It was a nice place to sit. You can look across to the Bistro &amp; Piazza and people watch. There were SO many people out on a Tuesday night who came for dinner and drinks. It was actually pups on the piazza so lots of cute dogs out there.  Spa services by Divine Touch They offer spa services to the room from Divine Touch a local company. My mom and I did facials last year in Dublin , Ohio and had massages in Hocking Hills  (twice), so we wanted to try a facial here too! You can make your booking through Gervasi once you book a room . Check this page for a list of services and prices. We had the oxygen facial which was SO relaxing. Mom wanted to nap after but I wouldn’t allow it! The facial isn’t like one I’ve had before. The product bubbles up on your face like  pop rocks which was crazy! It does work though and my mom and I felt we had really soft skin for the week following. It’s always good to get all that dead skin off your face, especially in the summer. Touring the Ohio Winery We did the vineyard tour, which is another think you need to book for when you make a reservation. You don’t have to be a guest to take a tour though, go ahead and call to make a reservation even if you aren’t staying at the villas. You do a wine tasting with the tour and learn about the pairings for different types of wine. My mom really noticed the changes, more than I did, but then again I eat Cheetos, Hot Pockets, and Kool-aid on the regular. I suppose my palate isn’t too sophisticated lol! Gervasi Bistro &amp; other eateries We ate lunch at the Crush House which was so so tasty! We got a quesadilla, cheese sticks (so good!) and I had a meatball sandwich. I have learned a lot traveling, and one of those things is you can never go wrong ordering a meatball sandwich . For dinner we ate at the Bistro which is the fanciest option on site for dining. There’ also the Piazzo which is kind of like the Crush House but is outside on the patio with live music and an open grill. You HAVE to order the sausage stuffed banana peppers. They have a good kick to them and are so tasty I am going to try to make them at home ask my mom to try and make them at home! The wedge salad was great, and the short rib was the bomb. I think our favorite was the pizza though. Such a perfect crust! For dessert we had the gelato sampler. Chocolate was my favorite! Mom surprisingly liked the pistachio the most. It was only $7 for all this ice cream, that’s crazy! Last mentions about Gervasi! If you want to buy the wine you try, you can at the Marketplace. We picked up FOUR bottles of wine and a couple of chocolates (bacon chocolate for Ben!). I thought this was so funny. Bombay Sapphire is the most popular gin in India and one of the most popular drinks, after maybe Old Monk. I just thought that was the most random thing to find! A necklace made with the bottle. Another thing to note is that you can get married at Gervasi Vineyard. There is a big area off to the side of the lake with a platform that can be enclosed in the case of rain. They have an extra catering kitchen and a ceremony area by the water. They also have another place to get married in the little greenhouse."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-portland-oregon/,usa,"What makes Portland  a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Portland literally has something for everyone. With beaches, mountains, vineyards, rivers and hiking trails all within a few hours drive, Portland is also a great home base for exploring Oregon. The city itself boasts a great food scene, walkable neighborhoods, and some of the best beer, pinot noir , and craft cocktails in the Northwest. What 5 star hotel is the best in Portland Oregon? The Nines , Portland is literally right in the middle of downtown. Occupying the former Meier &amp; Frank department store building, The LEED certified hotel overlooks Pioneer Square and is surrounded by restaurants and retail shops. Perched atop the Nines is one of my favorite restaurants/bars in Portland, Departure. The rooftop patios boast beautiful views of downtown, while the indoor restaurant offers amazing Asian cuisine, and Portland’s largest sake selection. What about boutique hotels in Portland, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? Portland has some great boutique hotels, but my favorite would have to be Portland’s Hotel Monaco . When President Obama visited Portland last summer, he stayed at the Hotel Monaco (if the President chooses to stay there, you know it must be good).   Located in the heart of downtown Portland, Hotel Monaco offers guests complimentary bicycles to explore the city, as well as an evening wine reception to get to know fellow visitors while tasting local wines. With vibrant décor and quirky amenities (think animal print robes, luxurious bath products, and a complimentary gold fish to keep you company), the Hotel Monaco is reflective of the colorful city in which it resides. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Portland? Where do I start? Portland’s waterfront is great for biking, walking or running. Visitors can also rent kayaks or canoes and paddle along the Willamette River for great views of the city. If you want to enjoy the rive from a larger boat, the Portland Spirit offers brunch and dinner cruises. Hundreds of hiking trails are a short drive away, or you can stay in the city and hike Forest Park up to Pittock Mansion. The Willamette Valley also offers wine hikes through vineyards, or horseback riding wine tours. Where are the best hang outs during the day in Portland Oregon? Locals and visitors alike enjoy spending time at the waterfront (the stretch of parks and paths along the Willamette River). The Tom McCall waterfront park regularly plays host to festivals end events, while every week the Saturday Market attracts hundreds of people to the area. There’s also great restaurants and shops long the south waterfront, or grassy areas where you can relax with a book. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Portland and what are their best dishes? Portland has so many great restaurants. If you’re in the mood for Thai food, Pok Pok is a must. Their famous Fish Sauce Chicken Wings are worth the inevitable wait. Portland City Grill is a great place to bring a date. It’s located on the 30 th floor of the US bank building and boasts stunning views of the city. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? As cliché as it may sound, if you’re visiting Portland you have to try the famed VooDoo Donuts. While it’s the bacon maple bar that made them famous, my favorite donut is the “Dirty Old Bastard” (chocolate frosting with Oreo cookie crumbles and peanut butter drizzle – don’t let the name deter you, this donut is delicious). Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers in Portland Oregon?  The Pearl District (the neighborhood that borders downtown) has a great combination of local shops (e.g. Powell’s Books, Made in PDX store) and favorite stores (e.g. Anthroplogie, LuLuLemon). Northwest 23 rd street also boasts a great selection of boutiques, designer brands and great restaurants.   What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Portland? My favorite spa in Portland is Ruby’s Spa at McMenamins Edgefield. The spa is beautiful and guests can relax in the outdoor, heated (saltwater) soaking pool before or after treatment. The Edgefield grounds are gorgeous, and include restaurants, a golf course, a winery and a brewery. I also love Portland Spa &amp; Boutique which is located on the waterfront and offers a good variety of servies to help you relax and rejuvenate.   Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Located in Portland’s West Hills, Pittock mansion overlooks the entire city, and is a beautiful place to watch the sunset. While you can drive to the mansion, most visitors prefer to hike the short trail through Forest Park and take in beautiful scenery. Pack a picnic, find a place on the lawn, then sit back and enjoy nature’s nightly production. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot in Portland. You don’t have to look to hard to find some amazing drinks in Portland. Creative craft cocktails are the norm, and mixologists here do them right! There are so many great places to grab a drink in Portland , but one of my favorites has to be The Rookery bar at Raven and Rose. If you’re a bourbon fan, don’t miss   The Multnomah Whiskey Library, where – as the name suggests – hundreds of bottles of whiskey occupy the shelves covering the walls. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? If you’re looking for somewhere to dance, or enjoy bottle service, check out Fifth Ave Lounge, District, or XV. All three clubs are downtown, and within walking distance from one another."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-redondo-beach/,usa,"What makes Redondo Beach a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Redondo Beach is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. It has miles of sandy beaches and a beautiful marina filled with activities plus a slip for your luxury boat! Whether you’re looking for adventure or relaxation, this is the place to be! What 5 star hotel is the best in Redondo beach? Redondo Beach is a small, seaside town with no 5 star hotels but there are luxury accommodations. Portofino Hotel &amp; Marina is a Mediterranean-esq, 4-star oceanfront hotel. Originally opened in 1962, this charming hotel recently underwent a multi-million dollar renovation. While staying at the Portofino Hotel, guests are treated to first class service and amenities such as in-room massages, oceanside pool &amp; spa, fire pits on the harbor, and complimentary beach cruisers. Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in Redondo Beach, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Redondo Beach Hotel is a sleek, modern boutique hotel with 112 guest rooms and suites located just steps from the marina, the beach and all of the city’s best attractions. I would send my friends and family to this hotel because it offers many of the same amenities as the Portofino Hotel &amp; Marina at half the price. Click here for rates and availability.  Are there any fun activities in Redondo Beach for the adventurous traveler? The adventurous traveler won’t have to go far to find thrilling activities in this city! At King Harbor visitors can go kayaking, sailing, (SUP) Stand Up Paddle Boarding, whale (and dolphin) watching, surfing and more! Where are the best hang outs during the day in Redondo Beach? With all the activities available, you’ll want to spend most of your free time at the beach! Pack an umbrella, sunblock and a few snacks and enjoy a relaxing day in the sand or get moving and do a few of the activities listed above. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Redondo Beach and what are their best dishes (include any location information you have)? On date night, my husband and I would probably go to R10 Social House (just off the boardwalk at 179 N. Harbor Drive). This gastropub features a full list of handcrafted cocktails and fresh, farm-to-table fare.. My favorite dish on the menu is the P.E.I. Mussels! Every time I have this dish, which is often, I want to order a second bowl before I’ve even finished the first! Other can’t miss dishes are the Jidori Chicken and Waffles, Mac-n-Cheese with house-cured lamb bacon and Alice and Willard’s Short Ribs! These local restaurants are also date night worthy: BALEENkitchen, H.T. Grill, Bottega Romana, Ortega 120 and Chez Melange. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? I can’t say who makes the best but I can tell you about MY favorite place, Kirari West Bake Shop! This quaint, modern bakery offers an extensive selection of gluten-free pastries and bold coffee. Since I love salted caramel and my husband loves chocolate, we usually order a salted caramel scone and a slice of Dark Passion, a decadent chocolate sponge cake with chocolate mousse and fruit confiture. More often than not, we compromise and share the chocolate brownie with sea salt caramel! Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers?  The Riviera Village is THE place to shop. From clothing and accessories to home and garden, you’ll find everything you need in this trendy neighborhood. Several shops sell recognizable and local designers. Come for a visit and pick your favorite shop! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Redondo Beach? Finding a place to pamper yourself is easy unless having too many choices gives you anxiety! With over 30 salons and spas to choose from, the Riviera Village can satisfy any budget. My top picks are Ananta Spa, Salon Riviera, Spade Skin Care, Riviera Eyebrows, and Lux Nail Spa. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? For a great view of the sunset, I would stay in the Village area and grab a spot on the Avenues (A-I) just above the strand where you can get a full view and stunning photographs. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Pre-gaming can be done in a number of spots around town. If you’re at the beach, Barney’s Beanery and The Slip Bar &amp; Eatery are casual choices right on the boardwalk. A few blocks away is Hudson House, a gastropub owned by former Top Chef 10 runner up Brooke Williamson and husband. Popular with locals and visitors alike, this pub boasts an extensive beer list, signature craft cocktails and a killer menu!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-austin/,usa,"What makes Austin a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Austin definitely has an understated tone of luxury. It’s not known for its fancy yachts or extravagant nightclubs, but offers a more laid back and relatable glamour. Such is the way of Texas charm and character! Known as the live music capital of the world, Austin attracts musicians, actors and celebrities from across the globe with its popular music and film festivals. In addition to this, Austin boasts world-class restaurants, the famous (or infamous) Sixth Street and bountiful five-star accommodations whose hospitality lives up to the southern charm stereotype. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town?   The Driskill hotel is a must when visiting Austin. Built in 1886 it has become a historic Austin icon and is situated in the perfect location. It’s only a short walk away to the Texas State Capital, legendary 6 th street, fine dining, and the convention center among many other sights. The inside of The Driskill has been restored to its original ornate opulence with glamorous marble, columns and stained-glass features. It is honestly one of the most beautiful hotels we’ve ever stepped foot in – it makes your jaw drop!   If you’re looking for an added thrill, book room 525 as it is rumored to be haunted by the original owner of the hotel. He lost the property in a bet only a year after building and died shortly thereafter! What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? There are two boutique hotels that really stand out from the rest. The first is Hotel Ella , which recently underwent a multi-million dollar renovation. It was money well spent because the property is absolutely gorgeous and screams Texas charm. It boasts an in-house restaurant and bar for a conveniently delicious meal or libation and is located just a few blocks down from the UT campus. Hotel St. Cecilia in SoCo (South Congress) is such a fun little hotel. Each room has its own signature Austin style and takes inspiration from its namesake St. Ceclia, the patron saint of music and poetry. Perhaps the best feature is the handmade organic beds built by Sweden’s most reputable bedding company, Hästens. We recommend staying in one of the hotel’s 6 poolside bungalows to make the most out of the Texas heat! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? Paddle boarding and kayaking on Lady Bird Lake has become somewhat of a city pastime for its residents. On nice days, lines for the rentals can be quite long, but getting out and enjoying the lake beneath the Austin skyline well makes up for it! If you’d like some tears in your eyes from a mixture of adrenaline and fast speeds, zip lining on Lake Travis has recently started gaining traction. There are five zip lines available, with some an amazing 20 stories high. You can even do these at night for that extra kick of excitement. If you’re here at the right time you’ve got to hit up the famous SXSW or ACL music festivals. In the past decade, each of these festivals has grown into a monster all their own, with literally thousands of people flying in from all over the world to attend them. Get Platinum badge tickets for SXSW to attend everything available or VIP tickets to the ACL festival, which will provide you a truly luxurious experience!   Where are the best hang outs during the day?   It wouldn’t be Austin without a good place to hang out during the day. Think of Zilker Park as New York’s Central Park, but with more hipsters and less museums (it’s also less than half the size.) Within Zilker Park lies the crown jewel, Barton Springs Pool . The Pool measures three acres in size and is fed from a natural underground spring that keeps temperatures between 68-70 degrees. When you’re melting from the 105-degree Texas summer, Barton Springs Pool is where everybody goes to beat the heat. You’ll most likely be serenaded by guitar players and musicians as you soak up the sun. Lady Bird Lake is a section of the Colorado River that is popular for paddle boarding and kayaking. Some of the best views of the Austin skyline can be seen from here.   If you’re like us and have an obsession with cafes and coffee shops, then Austin is a gold mine. Head to Kerbey Lane for Texas’ best queso (basically the most delicious cheese dip on the planet), Jo’s Coffee for an adorable photo op, and Mozart’s Coffee Roasters for a delicious Mexican mocha right on the coast of Lady Bird Lake. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Austin and what are their best dishes? Austin is such a difficult place to just recommend one or two places because it truly does have world-class food. Here you will find that most restaurants tend to offer something traditional, put an Austin spin on it, and present it in a way that is incredibly unique. Uchi is a sushi restaurant, but with that Austin flair we just mentioned. It has a relaxed atmosphere and is one that is enjoyed by many celebrities as well. People will often mention that the menu is full of strange items, however you’d be hard pressed to find anything you don’t like! Try out the machi cure or the bacon steakie and then join the other restaurant goers shouting from the rooftop that it is their new favorite dish. If you’re not much for sushi, definitely add Barley Swine to your list. Of course, they also operate a bit differently from your typical restaurant. They use fixed menus that you pay one price for and get a whole list of crazy, small dishes. Funyuns and caviar… beet trifle, grilled mushroom and a blue cheese cookie… scrambled egg, crawfish boil and potato…. The list goes on and on. Each dish is extremely unique and oftentimes includes words we’ve never heard of. In addition to the menu, they offer beer and wine pairings. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best?   Over the past decade, food trucks have been exploding into the Austin scene. So much so, that a night out on the town can easily mean grabbing some crazy dinner concoction from a food truck, going to the next one for some drinks, then one food truck down for dessert. Specialty dessert food trucks have become abundant recently, including the Cow Tipping Creamery and Banarchy (it wouldn’t be a food truck without a food-related joke or pun.) If you don’t think food should be mobile, try out Cream Whiskers instead, located just a few blocks from the University of Texas campus. Their specialty is the cream puff, with as many variations as your imagination can come up with. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? Are there designers we should make sure to meet? Kendra Scott Jewelry originated here in Austin so you’ll find her stores peppered throughout the city. If you haven’t heard of her already (she’s blown up across America), you should make it a point to stop into a store for some beautiful handmade jewelry pieces! East 6 th street is a great place to shop for local stylish treasures. There you can find an eclectic mix of clothing, jewelry and craft stores which are sure to keep you occupied for hours. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Austin?   Lakeway Resort and Spa is one of the most well known retreats in Austin. Located 30 minutes north west of the city on Lake Travis, it’s a great place to escape the bustling town and relax. We stayed there for a wedding recently and didn’t want to leave! Austin is well known for it’s active and healthy lifestyle – from natural food to skin treatments! Organic Spa Massage and Skincare is an upscale salon offering massages, facials, body treatments and several different packages all using (you guessed it) organic products. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? There are several great places to see a great Texas sunset! Auditorium Shores is a park located right on the southern end of the Colorado River with great views of the Austin skyline. Getting outside the city a bit, the 360 Bridge Overlook and Mt. Bonnell are fun little hikes for wonderful sunset views over the Texas hill country. One of the more unique places to see the setting sun is from the Congress Street Bridge near Lady Bird Lake . As the sun sets in the spring and summer, nearly 1.5 million bats fly out from underneath the Congress Street Bridge to feed on insects, which actually makes this the largest urban bat colony in North America. We recommend renting a kayak and experiencing this from the lake itself! If you’re looking for a great place to eat or drink while watching the sunset, look no further than The Oasis, located just northwest of Austin on Lake Travis. It is quite literally perched on the side of a cliff, with large patios overlooking the beautiful lake. Traditionally, the sunset is met with applause from the patrons as well as a round of margaritas. Doesn’t get any better than that!   Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. It wouldn’t be a trip to Austin without stepping foot on Austin’s legendary 6 th Street for some live music. However, from a local’s perspective we much prefer a more low-key night out on Rainey Street. It has a more casual laid-back ambience that we love. But if you’re an Austin newbie, do at least one night out on 6 th . We’d even recommend ending the night with the best drunk pizza one can get – Roppolos!"https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-san-fran/,usa,"What makes San Francisco a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? San Francisco, (don’t call it SF or San Fran, locals will make fun of you) is the perfect location for a luxury vacation. The weather is very mild, never too hot or too cold. The city is filled with gorgeous hotels, five star restaurants and views that will make your jaw drop. Golden Gate Park gives Central Park in New York a run for its money. Plus the entire city is only 5 by 5 sq. miles so it is possible to walk nearly everywhere, as long as you don’t mind climbing some hills. feature image source: Jamie Beverly What 5 star hotel is the best in  San Francisco ? If you are looking for extravagant luxury, look no further than The Palace Hotel . This historic landmark was built in 1875 and has been the epitome of elegance in San Francisco since its construction. A renovation was completed in 2015, so if you have stayed here in the past, it might be time for another visit. The hotel is located on the outskirts of the financial district, about a 10 minute walk from Union Square. Though the location could be better, the experience could not be. It is one of only 30, four diamond hotels in the world and a luxury San Francisco vacation would not be complete without a night in The Palace. A night here will cost you about $725 during peak season. What about boutique hotels in  San Francisco , of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? As a Seattle hipster, I really hate big name brands and chains… I will always choose a boutique hotel over a Fairmont or a Marriot hotel. My favorite hotel in San Francisco is The Argonaut . If you couldn’t guess by the name, the hotel has a nautical theme and the rooms are decorated accordingly. The building itself is a restored warehouse that was built in 1907, and thus it is not the typical 20-story high-rise that you may be expecting. Many of the rooms have exposed brick and wooden beams, making you feel as though you are a part of the buildings history. The location on the edge of Fisherman’s Warf leaves little to be desired. Basically everything is within walking distance, providing easy access to the myriad of amazing restaurants nearby. One night here will set you back about $450 during peak season, but trust me, it’s worth it. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in  San Francisco? San Francisco is unique in its proximity to California’s Wine Country. In about an hour (depending on traffic) you can be in Napa or my personal preference Sonoma. There are a number of different tour companies in San Francisco that offer luxury wine tours. The best, in my opinion, is Platypus Wine Tours . This company is special in that they focus on smaller, family run wineries as opposed to the larger more commercial vineyards. Again, my hipster nature is shining through. These little mom and pop shops typically provide a more intimate experience in which you can learn more about what you are drinking and the family who is making it. Where are the best hang outs during the day in  San Francisco? I have already briefly mentioned Golden Gate Park, but this thousand acre park in the center of the city is the perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon. My favorite part of the park is Strawberry Hill, which occupies an entire island in the middle of Stow Lake in the center of the park. From the island you can see views of the city, though they are partially obscured by trees now. You can also take some really cute photos at the Chinese Peace Pagoda near the edge of the lake. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in  San Francisco  and what are their best dishes? As one of the best foodie cities in the world, this is the hardest question so far. For me, the atmosphere at Foreign Cinema takes the cake. The menu changes daily, but is influenced by Mediterranean-Californian cuisines. It has been listed as one of the Top 100 restaurants by the San Francisco Chronical for the past 16 years. It is such an icon that September 18 th has been designated as Foreign Cinema day in the city. Start the night off right with a glass of champagne and some oysters on the half shell. End the night with the eggnog-scented crème brûlée or sample one of their local rotating cheeses. There is really nothing you can order here that will disappoint you.     Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? Dessert tastes vary so much from person to person. I am not really a baked good person, but I know most people would find that strange. My personal favorite is Bi-Rite Creamery. They serve house-made, small-batch, artisanal ice cream. The flavors range from the ordinary (malted vanilla) to the obscure (honey lavender). I am on a personal quest to try them all. For those of you who prefer more traditional dessert options, head over to Bob’s Donut and Pastry Shop. This place has over 2000 reviews on Yelp (which is insane if you are unfamiliar with the site) and is open 24/7. It has been family owned and operated since 1960, and serves up some of the best donuts in the country.     Time for a great sunset view in  San Francisco … where would you go? Hands down, Lands End is the best place to watch a sunset in San Francisco. Here you get views of not only the Golden Gate Bridge, but also all of Marin County. You can walk out past the ruins of the Sutro Baths. When it was built in 1896, it was the largest public saltwater swimming pool complex in the world. However, the facility burned down in 1967, but the ruins are still pretty cool. You can also see numerous shipwrecks from the Coastal Trail during low tide. All in all, this is a really sweet place to visit at any time of day, but is at its best during sunset. cable car source:  Richard Gillin Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. My favorite spot to start a night of drinking in San Francisco is The Buena Vista. Generally, I need a little caffeine to get me going and the Irish Coffees here are the perfect solution. There is not a better Irish Coffee in the country in my opinion, and trust me, I have tried my fair share. Plus, the most popular way to get here is via cable car, if you want to check that adventure off your bucket list as well. Pick up the cable car at Powell &amp; Hyde heading toward Fisherman’s Warf and you can’t miss The Buena Vista. If you end the night at a fancy club in  San Francisco , which one do you head towards? I may not be the best person to answer this question, as I don’t really frequent night clubs. I much prefer a quieter evening with a group of friends at a fancy bar as opposed to a night of drunken debauchery at a packed club. On that note, I am partial to Infusion in Union Square if I have my dancing shoes on. Though it looks really upscale, it is typically one of the cheaper clubs to get into and they constantly do promotions for free bottle service if you follow them on Instagram. Delirium in the Mission is also super fun, mostly because of the music they play which is a mix of top 40 and all the terrible music they played at your middle-school dances. It has been described as “one of the most underrated dance experiences ever”."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-santa-barbara/,usa,"What makes Santa Barbara a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Santa Barbara is a destination for many Hollywood celebrities for good reason. After all, it was the original “Hollywood” as it was home to California’s first movie production company in the 1920s! Santa Barbara has something for everyone and offers world class shopping, an array of fine dining, a lively nightlife of clubs and live music, a rich arts and culture scene, and of course the beautiful beachfront and all its accompanying water activities.  What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? A few of the most famous hotels in the Santa Barbara area are the Four Seasons Biltmore , the Fess Parker Doubletree , and Bacara Resort . Even if the rooms aren’t in your budget, go for cocktails in the beautiful ocean-view bar at the Biltmore (I recommend the Raspberry Smash!), and try the exquisite brunch at the Bacara or Fess Parker’s. What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? For a smaller, more intimate setting try the upscale boutique hotel San Ysidro Ranch and indulge in a romantic meal at the adjacent restaurant, Stonehouse. If you’d rather be in walking distance to all of downtown’s delights, check in to the swanky Spanish-style Canary Hotel . Make sure to take a dip in their rooftop pool and soak in the incredible 360 degree view of the ocean, mountains, and red tile rooftops! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? The adventurous traveler will be in heaven in Santa Barbara. Love sailing? Rent a boat from the harbor and sail along the palm tree lined coast and watch as dolphins swim alongside your boat. If you prefer to be in the water, go surfing, paddleboarding, or kayaking.   And if you love being under the sea, scuba dive through kelp forests at the world famous Channel Islands! If you prefer dry land, rent a bike and explore the historic sights throughout the town or go for a hike on one of the dozens of trails through the Santa Barbara mountains. What kind of sights are there to see? Santa Barbara has a rich history and stunning architecture. The Santa Barbara Mission is an iconic church founded in 1786. Spend an afternoon exploring its museum and gardens and bring a picnic for the lawns out front among the Rose Garden. The Courthouse is another icon for its Spanish Colonial Revival style building. Wander the halls, explore the historic rooms and make sure to go to the top for a breathtaking view of the mountains, city, and ocean! For other sights and museums, go to the Botanic Garden, Museum of Natural History, Museum of Art, the Presidio.   Read my somewhat controversial piece about The Secret of the SB Courthouse Clock Tower that spurred a heated debate on a local news website. Where are the best hangouts during the day? The beach volleyball courts at East Beach are a popular place to hang out in the sand—but get there early on weekends to grab a court as they fill up! If you’re like me and enjoy a good day drink, spend an afternoon in the “funk zone” on the Santa Barbara wine trail . Dozens of little tasting rooms have sprung up offering delicious wine, live music, and tasty treats. If shopping is your vice you’ll want to spend the day meandering Paseo Nuevo , the outdoor mall with everything from local boutiques to high end brand names. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Santa Barbara and what are their best dishes? Santa Barbara has dining options available for every palette and atmosphere. Check out the Santa Barbara Dining Guide to find exactly what suits your mood. For a fun, festive atmosphere check out the Cajun style Palace Grill. The crawfish pasta and crabcakes are a must! If you love Italian, make a reservation for the charming and delectable Ca’Dario and indulge in gourmet pasta. For some of the best Mexican food, order the seafood enchiladas at Los Agaves. For a beautiful patio and belly dancing along with your Middle Eastern fare you have to visit Zaytoons. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? If you’re a sucker for good ice cream like me, go for a cone at McConnell’s Creamery and check out the signed photos of famous celebrities and US presidents who have also indulged in their delicious ice cream. For some divine baked goods, go to Anderson’s Bakery for Danish style pastries and cakes. The apple strudel and chocolate layer cake will have you drooling. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? A local’s favorite any day of the week is the Boathouse at Hendry’s Beach. Watch the sun set over the ocean and enjoy a happy hour cocktail from their outdoor patio overlooking the beach.  Now that the sun’s gone down, tell us the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. If you’re feeling swanky grab a firepit table at Blush and order up one of their divinely fancy cocktails (try the Cotton Candy!). If you love a good craft beer and some live music grab an ale from Figueroa Mountain Brewing in the funk zone. And if you’re in the mood for dancing the night away to a live band, check out the calendar for SoHo and grab a drink while you boogie down. If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? While Santa Barbara doesn’t have a very fancy club scene, there is no shortage of places to take over the dance floor. You can warm up at places like Sandbar, O’Malleys, and the James Joyce (if there’s a live band playing). Then work your way to the bigger clubs like Tonic and Eos. If you’re feeling particularly bold head over to the Wildcat (affectionately referred to by locals as The Sh*tty Kitty) and dance the night away alongside the gogo girls."https://hippie-inheels.com/a-luxury-guide-to-baja-california-mexico/,usa,"What makes Baja a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? There’s something about being in Mexico that ignites a full-fledged “vacation-mode” feeling.  Even though the temperatures are about the same as in San Diego, and the coastline only has subtle differences, no other place makes you want to relax and drink margaritas like Mexico does. It’s also much more economical than San Diego. You don’t have to fully splurge to feel like a luxury traveler. Considering a few important tips , it’s also really easy to get to and visit. view of Rosarito from a rented villa in Baja California What boutique hotel would you recommend to your friends that are stopping through? There aren’t too many boutique hotels in the area, but instead I’d recommend renting a beach house .  With a few friends, you can easily rent an entire house with a BBQ, patio and beach access. Search on Airbnb.com and Homeaway.com to find the perfect spot. What about 5 Star, of them all, which is the best in your town? I love the Hotel Coral &amp; Marina in Ensenada .  I’ll stay there with my family and enjoy the pool, the surrounding beaches and the great Mexican food in town. It’s such a serene and luxurious place, away from the chaos of the city.  There’s also a harbor where many people choose to park their boats.  If you happen to know someone with a yacht, why not make the trip via the sea from San Diego? I’ve never done it, but one can dream. Right? view from Hotel Coral and Marina Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? There are loads of activities for the adventurous traveler all up and down the Baja coast. While of course there is deep sea fishing, diving, kayaking and surfing, there are also a few more unique experiences too.  Near Los Arenales, the Sand Dunes of Cantamar tower over the water.  Rent 4x4s and race up and down the desert-like dunes. Where are the best hang outs during the day? There are tons of day trips to take in the Ensenada area .  One popular spot to visit is La Bufadora , the largest marine geyser in the world. It shoots water up to 60 feet in the air. A surprise to most people, you can also go wine tasting in Baja. The Guadalupe Valley is full of wineries and it’s only about a 30 minute drive away. If you’re feeling lazy, just head to the beach! You can also bar hop down the main drag in downtown Ensenada if you’re feeling up to it. Be aware the cruise ships pull in early bringing a lot of debauchery. Sometimes, the loud music and dancing starts as early as lunchtime, ensuring great people watching.

Anything on the menu at Muelle3 will be delicious, so you can’t go wrong there.  Make sure to try the “ceviche de la casa”—avocado mixed with fresh tuna and octopus. If you are staying near the tourist village or Puerto Nuevo , pop into a place for fresh lobster.  Almost every restaurant will be serving it, so don’t be afraid to window shop first.  Order a lobster tail, rice, beans and tortillas.  Eat them separately or make your own mini-lobster burritos.

It’s great for its food and atmosphere and sometimes there is live music, too. La Fonda  is another great spot right on the cliff overlooking the beach, and perfect for watching the sunset.  Try and get there early for a spot on the outdoor patio.  The margaritas are perfection and the tequila shots are huge."https://hippie-inheels.com/pack-for-a-hawaii-vacation/,usa,"What to Pack for a Hawaii Vacation There are so many different activities you can do in Hawaii. I’ve written about adventurous activities in Maui while also writing about the amazing spas you can visit . Since you could be hiking one day and enjoying a luxury dinner the next, I thought I’d jot down a guide on what to pack for a Hawaii vacation. This way you’re not stuffing a huge suitcase but you’re also not forgetting the essentials! Tips for a Hawaii Vacation If you haven’t booked your flight yet, check Kiwi for the best possible flights.  I wrote about my love for Kiwi here.  Basically, it does all the work of flight hacking and whatnot for you. Compare your flights here . Check the weather.  Might be obvious advice, but you never know! If it’s going to suddenly downpour while you’re there, no sense in worrying about packing for the outdoors. If you’re not a U.S. citizen, get travel insurance .  Healthcare in the U.S. is crazy expensive and travel insurance is so cheap. I always use and recommend World Nomads . Make a list of activities you’ll be doing.  This will help you pack light. No sense in bringing hiking clothes if you’re going to be in the water the whole time. What to Pack for a Hawaii Vacation Sunglasses Sunglasses are not only practical and good for your eye health but they can make an outfit look a lot better – it’s the ultimate accessory and one of the only ones I travel with. My favorite brand is Sunday Somewhere which area a little pricey but so durable. I also love LeSpecs which is also durable but closer to $50 per pair. I also love my Ray Ban Clubmasters. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Flowy Dresses I live in dresses when I travel. Dresses make it so much easier to get ready as you don’t have to match outfits and instantly look put together and chic. I love Free People and usually buy about 5 dresses from them every summer when I’m in the USA. They are around $88 originally but you can get them on sale online or at stores like Macy’s, usually around 30% off. I think of them as an investment! Turn on your JavaScript to view content Crop tops Crop tops are great with high waisted shorts and maxi skirts. I tend to go for simple cotton casual tops and have a few ruffled ones for night’s out. For the cotton ones, I try to get Top Shop or something a little more quality (not Forever 21) since I only buy about 3 each year and wear them over and over, so I want them to hold up. A favorite dressier one is the striped one below by Tia. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Jean Shorts You’ve gotta pack jean shorts! I got lucky with my favorite pair of Levi’s being on a clearance rack IN HAWAII for just $5. What are the chances!? But, I have others, mostly from Urban Outfitters, and have a regular jean color, black, and a tan pair. They are small, so I usually travel with all three. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Rompers or Jumpsuits These are the best thing ever invented and I pray they don’t go out of style! I always loved rompers, but I first bought my first pantsuit, a military green one from Urban Outfitters, last year for my travels in Israel and Morocco and it was the BEST thing I ever traveled with: instantly looking put together with zero effort. Since then, I’ve bought too many to count – a few of my favorites are cotton ones by Tia. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Bikinis I travel with too many bikinis. I always think, “Oh, one more won’t take up that much space,” but they kind of do. You should limit it to three if you can.

It’s nice to be able to escape to your “backyard” for a little staycation. What makes Waikiki a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Waikiki is truly a vacationer’s paradise! White sand beaches, luxury shopping (check out Ala Moana Mall !), and near perfect weather make for a great time here in the islands. Waikiki is the main hot spot for nightlife, has a huge number of hotels and spas, and there are numerous 5 star eateries in the area. What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? You can’t go wrong with The Trump Hotel in Waikiki if you’re looking for ultimate luxury. A lot of celebrities choose to stay there (we’ve actually seen one during our stay!), and it has an amazing infinity pool and spa. What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? We’ve heard that The Modern Honolulu is an amazing spot! It also boasts an insane infinity pool that hosts a lot of popular pool parties. They also have a club downstairs that we frequent, Addiction . ( editors note: I stayed at the Modern and wrote a review , check it out! Another popular boutique hotel is Hotel Renew . A block from the beach, near popular shops and restaurants, and some rooms are even dog friendly! Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? There are truly a countless number of adventurous activities for the thrill seeker in Hawaii. There are a ton of watersports available at Waikiki from parasailing to jet ski, and for the truly adventurous there’s shark cage diving! (All of which we’ve done!) We’ve also recently gone sky diving , and Hawaii is probably one of the most beautiful places to jump out of an airplane. Where are the best hang outs during the day? The beach is an obvious option, and living on an island, there are plenty to choose from. We also have a big food truck scene, and Salt at Kaka’ako is a fun place to try new, local cuisine. We also love to hike on our days off, and the views here are gorgeous! Try out Lanikai Pillboxes, Diamond Head, or Kokohead. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Waikiki and what are their best dishes? Italian is our favorite type of food, and La Cucina and Arancino on Beachwalk have some of the best pasta dishes we’ve ever eaten! La Cucina is run by a singular chef who hand makes all of their pasta dishes. The Ravioil Gorgonzola comes with a roasted garlic cream sauce and cranberries; simply out of this world! Arancino on Beachwalk is known for their Spaghetti Ai Ricci Di Mare, aka their uni pasta. Fresh uni, or sea urchin, is paired with a sweet garlic wine cream sauce that’s absolutely delicious! If you’re a seafood lover and you’ve never tried uni, this is a must! What’s one local food that needs to be tried? Poke, definitely! Pronounced “poh-kay”, it’s fresh raw fish that’s often garnished with sauces/spices and put on rice. (A poke bowl.) While there are many different kinds and you can find them almost anywhere, our favorites are the spicy ahi bowls. Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? When you come to Hawaii you NEED to try shave ice! You can find it almost anywhere, but our favorite place to get it is at Ailana’s , across from Ala Moana mall. Definitely try their homemade haupia and strawberry milk syrups! Shokudo also makes a drool-worthy honey toast dessert. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Waikiki? The Moana Lani Spa at the Moana Surfrider is one of the largest and luxurious spas in Waikiki. It also boasts great ocean view rooms, and offers a variety of treatments. Another great one is the Spa at Halekulani , which offers a variety of polynesian inspired treatments. Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Honestly you can catch an amazing sunset anywhere in Hawaii; it’s one of the perks of living here! Lay on the beach after a long day of surfing and feast your eyes on some of the most picturesque sunsets you’ve ever seen. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. A really popular place that offers unique cocktails and food is Bevy , a classy bar with fancy drinks and $1 oysters during happy hour. If you’re looking for something different, often before a night at the club we like to go to Air Park Karaoke with friends. They have a bar area and private karaoke rooms that are very modern and have the latest songs. They also have ahhhmazeball cocktails!  If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Our favorite clubs are The M or District Nightclub . Both have great music and are very popular clubbing spots. The District also has amazing $5 drink specials until midnight; can’t beat that."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-to-key-west/,usa,"What makes Key West a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Key West is hands down the prettiest town I have ever been too – from the stunning ocean views to the candy coloured houses, boutiques and cocktail bars. My favorite thing to do is spend an hour wandering the back streets, popping into a few of the lovely boutiques, and deciding which luxury beach house I want for myself! There is just so much on offer here – whether you want to just enjoy the gorgeous weather from one of the many luxurious resorts, or submerge yourself in the quirky island way of life. There is something new to experience around every corner. What 5 star hotel is the best in Key West? You are really rather spoilt for choice in Key West, with so many fabulous hotels and beach resorts. I would say The Southernmost Beach Resort can’t be beaten for location, and the rooms and amenities are stunning! Click here for rates and availability.  What about boutique hotels in Key West? Of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? The Paradise Inn is my absolute favourite. With private cottages, light and airy rooms, a pool courtyard and Jacuzzi, you really can’t beat this hotel for a luxurious getaway. Plus it is adult only, so really is a peaceful place. For vacationers with children I recommend the Eden House . It is the oldest hotel in Key West, has so much charm and history, and is utterly stunning! It is certainly the place to stay to be surrounded by some of that Key West quirky charm. Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Key West?   Being on an Island, the water is the best place to be! Chartering a boat is easy as there are so many companies that offer this. Take your picks from activities such as sailing, scuba diving, snorkeling, parasailing, jet skiing, fishing and kayaking! My favourite day trip is taking a tour over to the island of Fort Jefferson, an abandoned fort on an Island in the Dry Tortugas – an national park archipelago about 70 miles offshore. Beautiful! Where are the best hang outs during the day in Key West? The best beach around is in the Fort Myers national park, which is just outside the main town. It is idyllic, and perfect for a day trip. Strangely the cemetery is actually one of my favourite places to take a stroll through. It is so peaceful, and the views from up there are beautiful. Plus there are some funny infamous gravestones to look out for! For drinks, I love the Date and Thyme café for hanging out and drinking matcha lattes, and there are so many happy hour spots dotted around Key West (I won’t even begin naming them all!) it is always time for a cocktail! What are your picks of the tourist spots? You can’t miss visiting Hemmingway’s house and museum. Firstly, the house is a great example of the charming architecture in the town, but it is also really interesting to visit the place where this famous writer found his inspiration. There are also lots of interesting places hidden amongst the bars and shops – such as the oldest house in Key West, which you can just wander in and out of at your leisure. If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Key West and what are their best dishes? Louie’s Backyard is the most romantic restaurant for a date night, and perfect for trying beautifully prepared seafood. My pick is the Florida Lobster braised in Truffle Butter – delicious! The SHOR American Seafood Grill is a good choice for their stunning sunset view, and once you have seen the sunset in Key West you might never want to leave! And if seafood isn’t your thing, Antonia’s serves the best Italian around. And who doesn’t love Italian for a date night? Let’s talk desserts – what place makes the best? Better Than Sex is a dessert restaurant, open from 6pm-midnight, serving sexy cocktails and decadent desserts. You get a booth in the boudoir-styled interior and order off the extensive yummy dessert menu. My idea of heaven! Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Key West: who’s carrying the trendy local designers? There are lots of great boutiques amongst the tourist shops, and many stock local designers and handmade items. I love The Green Pineapple , a gorgeous boutique, yoga studio and health food café that stocks beautiful clothing and accessories. Date and Thyme is a great place to go for all things yummy and healthy, and I buy natural skincare products there. I really like Indigo boutique for clothing and jewellery and Artisans Key West for something a little bit different. If you are a book lover, there are a couple of great book stores, including Key West Island Books which stocks a selection of local authors, so even with your poolside read you can be fully submerged in your surroundings!  Lastly, Key West has a really great creative scene, and you will find so many independent art galleries and studios dotted around. The perfect souvenir is something beautiful to hang in your home! I absolutely love the DE LA Gallery , which houses the work of Miami/Key West based photographer Jorge De La Torriente. His work is incredible! What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Key West? My favourite spa is Anahara spa on Duvval Street which is just beautiful and offers gorgeous treatments including massage, reflexology, mud wraps, and amazing facials. For nails I would recommend Nailtini , which offers everything from shellac to acrylics, and you can get a last minute wax there too! Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? Mallory square actually has a sunset party every night, with street performers, musicians, food carts, and crafts. If you just fancy a nice spot to have a drink and enjoy the view, I recommend the Sunset Tiki Bar &amp; Grille located at the Galleon Resort, and like many of the resorts, you don’t have to be a guest at the hotel to enjoy the bar! Just outside Key West, about an hour drive north, is the seven-mile bridge which is my absolute favourite spot to watch the sunset in the Keys. Park your car or bike, and take a wander down the old pedestrian-only bridge. Below you often see turtles and sharks in the clear water, and the sunset is incredible. If you fly to Key West from Miami, this is a great place to stop on the drive back up North. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. There are so many great spots for drinking, but I really love the Porch , which is a craft beer and wine bar and is just stunning. I also really like Kelly’s , which has a gorgeous outdoor courtyard. For tequila lovers, Agave 308 Tequila Bar is perfect for margaritas! If you end the night at a fancy club in Key West, which one do you head towards? VIP clubs and long lines don’t really fit in to the Key West laid back style, so you won’t find swanky night clubs here. It is, however, full of lively bars and dancing – so you will have a good night that’s for sure. If it is a lounge style bar with live music that is your thing, Little Room Jazz Club is a great spot. Otherwise, get ready to have fun and head to one of the lively gay clubs, such as Aqua or 801 Bourbon Bar which has nightly drag shows! It is all part of the Key West eclectic island style – and one that you will soon fall in love with!"https://hippie-inheels.com/my-top-10-adventure-activities-to-do-in-maui-hawaii/,usa,"My Top 10 Adventure Activities to Do in Maui Hawaii Maui is not a place to sit around on the beach. It’s a place to go play and be active! Everyone else around will be, so why not join in? Even if you have a budget of 20 bucks you can rent a SUP (stand up paddleboard) and look into the clear blue ocean for turtles! And remember, you can always kill two birds with one stone. For example, in whale watching season don’t book a whale tour. Book a snorkeling tour instead, and you’ll see whales while you’re out there. Here are my 10 favorite adventure activities to do in Maui Hawaii. Tips for Visiting Maui, Hawaii For flights to Maui, check out Kiwi to get the cheapest options. I use it now for all my flight bookings ( you can see a full post here ), whether it’s domestic or international. If you’re not a US Citizen, make sure you check out any visa requirements to visit. I use iVisa for everything related to tourist visas . Also, US Healthcare is expensive (take it from a former nurse!). One small, broken ankle could wind up costing more than your whole trip if you don’t have insurance. I highly recommend World Nomads while you’re here , especially with these activities. You can easily get a quote in the box on my sidebar or clicking here . For a full guide to Maui beyond these activities, check out my little guide here . If you want to look through all the tours you can do, Viator has a huge list ! 10 Adventurous Activities to do in Maui Hawaii 1. Helicopter Ride over Maui My tour with Air Maui really topped the charts of “coolest shit I did in Hawaii.” I think it’s absolutely worth the money. The trip is short and sweet, takes up hardly any of your day, and you get to see a glimpse into so many areas of the island. You can even do the Road to Hana by helicopter in an hour rather than drive it which takes all day. Check out Helicopter Tours on Viator here 2. Canopy Zipline Tour I’d only ever been once before back in Ohio at Hocking Hills with my parents. If you’re an Ohioan, the ones in Maui are a little bigger but no scarier. I chose Piiholo Ranch Zipline . It’s located in the cowboy town of Makawao (779 Piiholo Road) in what they call “upcountry Maui”; I suggest going early to the town, exploring and having lunch before your tour. See all similar Zipline tours here Tip for Families: If you’re looking for free activities to do in Maui Hawaii, or things to do with kids, this is free for kids under 12 with an adult accompanying them. They have a couple different options and both seemed pretty in the middle on a scale of hiking to skydiving. There was a drop after one zip where you have to just walk off the platform and a suspension cable will catch you part way and slow you down to the ground – with this part, I got the same adrenaline as bungee jumping ! So, pretty cool. This is the drop part that I loved, and below you see the staff pulling another zipper (is that a word) in. He was a blast as a tour guide!  The ranch itself goes back all the way to 1830 when missionaries came. During the tour, you’ll hear stories and see the forests of Haleakala. I did the 5 line which was $190 USD. You must wear closed-toe shoes, long pants work best, you can take a camera with a safety strap, and you must be over 8 years old and over 50 pounds (max 275). Tours are rain or shine. I had some rain; they gave us coats and I actually enjoyed the showers. 3. Snorkeling from a catamaran You HAVE to go snorkeling while in Maui. The coral reefs are cooler than any I’ve seen in places like Thailand, and the water has such good visibility. I chose “luxury sailing charters”  Alii Nui  and was not disappointed. See similar snorkeling tours here When we showed up, it seemed like there were too many people for the boat and they said: “just wait until we’re out and you’ll see there is loads of space…” They were right. When you arrive, it’s early, cold, and breakfast is piled high for everyone, so of course, people jam into the bottom of the boat to eat. As soon as we took off, people spread out over the trampolines and outside the edges of the catamaran. They never take more than 60 people. Other than the snorkeling being amazing (we went to two locations, gear was great, and wetsuit tops provided), staff was funny and helpful, they were fully stocked with sunscreen, towels, blankets, and fresh water hoses to rinse off, and the FOOD was amazing – even though goPro’s don’t do it justice. Granted, I just got in from a year in India, but I devoured everything. Full breakfasts with bacon, eggs, croissant, bagels, fruit and more), to snack time (one of my favorite times of day lol) which were veggies, pita and dips, and cookies, to a yummy Hawaiian lunch of pulled Kalua pork, macaroni salad, and more. It was a six-hour tour which was just right to snorkel, lay out and enjoy the boat, eat and mingle. You can also scuba or huka dive from the boat at an extra fee. I did the morning snorkel deluxe. Arrive at 6:30 am at Ma’alaea Harbor (slip #56, parking is free). The cost is $165 USD and you can book online through the link above.   Tip: bring clothing for COLD weather. It was freezing in the morning. Also, yes, booze is included in the price! 4. Surf like a local! I really wish my photos would have turned out better for this, but sadly most are blurry as the zoom was messed up on my camera, or actually, I think I just need a new camera. I went surfing with Nancy Emerson Surf Clinic . She is a pro surfer herself and has been a Hollywood stunt double. She has schools in Oahu, Maui, and the Gold Coast. She’s not only the first school to open in Maui, but she focuses on safety and teaching people about the ocean instead of just throwing loads of people in the sea on boards and collecting cash. It’s individualized attention from the pros and the most there would ever be are 5 people if you choose the least expensive option. My instructor was huge and could probably have blocked a wave for me with his body if he tried haha, but he was like a lifeguard and also gave me a push for each wave since at first people can’t really paddle hard enough to catch the fast waves. If spots are booked up during your stay, check out more surfing places here sad these are blurry :( We had a land lesson first then spent over 2 hours in the water even though my lesson was only two hours (my instructor was a really good surfer, and I think just loved being in the water so neither of us was keeping time). We only stopped because I literally couldn’t paddle anymore. My arms were so tired and my legs were shaky. But, thanks to snowboarding almost my whole life, I got up on the first wave and by the third was turning. It was amazing, and I’ve been daydreaming about surfing ever since. Their lessons were one of the most memorable parts of my trip, and I highly recommend taking lessons through her clinic. Lessons start at $95 for two hours. Also, while doing land lessons I looked over and saw THIS GUY: 5. Stand Up Paddleboarding (SUP) &amp; Kayaking Something that anyone can do! You just need to get used to balancing on the board and start out in really, really calm water. We saw a turtle go by and since the water is so clear, you can see all the cute fish underneath. It’s also a great workout! Renting was once as cheap as $10 so it’s easy to just do on a whim anywhere. One well-known company to rent from is called Hawaiian Paddle Sports  who you can also get kayaks from. make sure to wear sunscreen! If you want some more guidance, check here for SUP lessons 6. Road to Hana This road starts near Paia and goes up to the small isolated town of Hana on the east coast. We weren’t in AWE of the road to Hana, but it was very cool. Luckily, our hotel Paia Inn gave us a printed out personalized guide of what to stop and see because the signage isn’t great. Alternatively, you can buy CDs that explain the stops along the way. You’re going to need something to tell you which mile markers to slow down at. Also, they make it out like you need a lunch, and there’s NOTHING on the way, but there were loads of stalls selling food. Still, we took a lunch because we didn’t know. Mana food is amazing and has delicious sandwiches and salads. For car rentals, check rentalcars.com ; they compare all the major car hire sites. If you’d prefer, there are tons of different tours for the Road to Hana. We stayed in Paia, but if you aren’t, then save time to see this cool little town. Also, go to Ho’okipa to watch the kite-surfers (most famous windy surf place in the world). The first bits are Twin Falls, a Bamboo Forest, and painted Eucalyptus trees. Basically, after that, we just drove. We didn’t stop for, well anything until we got to Hana Bay. To be honest, it was raining and all the cars were driving slow, so we got kind of bored. The views were covered by clouds. We’re used to Indian traffic, and it was exhausting not to be able to pass people ;) You need 3 hours to drive out there. If you make stops, then you need a whole day dedicated to this drive and you should get started early in the morning. 7. Bike to the beach I hadn’t ridden a bike since I was a kid, and Ben sort of hates riding bikes, but we did it anyways ha! Our apartment at Spreck’s Plantation had a few lying around so we went to the beach, and it was really fun. There are bike rentals all over the island and bike lanes making it safe. If you want, you can even go on bike or mountain bike tours (and now a few things we  didn’t do,  but are great options for your trip to Maui!) 8. Horseback riding I really wanted to do this but didn’t have time. I was looking at Mendes Ranch because it is in the mountains and  views of the ocean too. Most of the ranches in Makawao don’t have sea views. Check out other horseback riding tours here 9. Scuba diving We didn’t have it in our budget to do it while out on our Alli Nui tour, but you could on that boat or you can use a variety of companies. Actually, if you want to snorkel, but with a smaller group of people, like 6-8, you can look into Snorkel Safari , a company I wanted to try but didn’t have time. Here are some scuba diving tours 10. Drive up and hike Haleakala This is a volcanic crater that’s famous to see at sunrise, and it’s a drive… which means waking up at 4:30 am. I’d just been to Bandung seeing huge craters that were amazing, and we didn’t want to get up early, so skipped. I know people will think that’s crazy, but sometimes when you travel you have to do what you feel like. I have a feeling I’ll be back and able to do this another time."https://hippie-inheels.com/luxury-guide-atlanta/,usa,"What makes Atlanta a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip? Atlanta offers a great array of dining and shopping experiences with a level of luxury that rivals most any city in the world.   Atlanta may not have as many “must see” tourist attractions as other cities, but it’s a fantastic place to visit for a weekend trip to spoil yourself!  What 5 star hotel is the best in your town? Atlanta offers a slew of upscale lodging options including the Ritz Carlton, St. Regis and Mandarin Oriental, but my favorite is the Four Seasons .   Not only does the hotel exude classic luxury, it’s in a prime Atlanta location.   Smack dab in the midst of Midtown, you can walk to many dining and nightlife options from the Four Seasons.  What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at? My personal preference is the Artmore Hotel which has a modern, funky vibe and a beautiful courtyard which is the perfect setting for happy hour cocktails. Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler? You don’t need to travel to an exotic location to dive or swim with whale sharks – you can do it at the Georgia Aquarium without even boarding a boat!  Where are the best hang outs during the day? During the daytime, you’ll find locals and tourists alike at Piedmont Park , Atlanta’s own (smaller) version of Central Park.   There’s plenty of green space for sports, playing with your pup or for a picnic.   If you’re hungry or thirsty, Park Tavern offers food and libations with a great view of the park and the Midtown Skyline .  If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Atlanta and what are their best dishes? Atlanta has so many amazing restaurant options!   For a mouthwatering steak (and 5 star service) head to Bone’s .   If you love Italian and crave carbs, Sotto Sotto is a great choice (and so is their mushroom risotto with truffle oil).   If you prefer farm-to-table fare, Miller Union can’t be beat.   For innovative, eclectic cuisine try Rathbun’s , and if you’re craving Southern delights, head to South City Kitchen , The Southern Gentleman or JCT Kitchen .   For more great dining recommendations, check out my Local’s Guide to Atlanta .  Let’s talk desserts- what place makes the best? A solid Atlanta stand-by brimming with dessert options is Café Intermezzo .   The bar/restaurant/cafe also serves an extensive list of coffee drinks and cocktails. Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who’s carrying the trendy local designers? The best designer shopping can be found at Phipps Plaza where you can find classic shops such as Dior, Fendi and Gucci, or the Buckhead Atlanta shopping complex which is home to luxury brands such as Christian Louboutin and Hermes. What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Atlanta? You can’t beat the spas at the Ritz Carlton Buckhead and the Four Seasons.  Time for a great sunset view… where would you go? I’d recommend that you head downtown to the Westin’s Sundial Restaurant and Bar.   The bar occupies the 73 rd floor of the hotel and the floor slowly rotates, offering you a 360 degree view of the city. Now that the sun’s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. Since the weather in Atlanta is warm or mild for most of the year, I’m a huge fan of roof-top bars.   Try SkyLounge atop the Glenn Hotel Downtown or Community Smith which tops the Renaissance Hotel in Midtown.  If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? Atlanta does have a thriving club scene, but you’re more bound to find young professionals out at one of the many bars in the Virginia Highlands neighborhood (my favorite for live music is Limerick Junction ).   If you’re looking for a perfectly crafted cocktail in an interesting setting, check out Prohibition in Buckhead.   You’ll find the entrance of the speakeasy styled bar hidden inside a telephone booth in the East Andrews complex.   To gain entry, you have to dial the phone and give the bartender the password."https://hippie-inheels.com/favorite-american-foods-dont-read-hungry/,usa,"My Favorite American Food (don’t read this while hungry) I actually go through withdrawal of American food when I get back to India. Going through these photos was rough guys… but I did for it you… ;) My favorite American Food I flew in to Ohio and left for Florida just two days later. It was a press trip and they feed us bloggers well, that’s for sure. It was 10 days of food heaven. Then I went to Vegas, as well as more time back in Ohio. Here were some of my faves. If you’re American I guess no explanation needed but stats show that only 38% of you are so I will put some captions on the stranger dishes. shrimp tacos! This sandwich was ordered mainly so us bloggers could take photos and even sharing it we couldn’t finish. The milkshake? Full of booze. Below is Guy’s restaurant from Diner’s Drive-ins and Dives. You’ve got to try it in Vegas! It was my favorite of all the places I tried. I was working with their PR team so they wanted us to try a lot of dishes. I can’t even count how many they sent out! My friend was on a diet for her upcoming wedding and obviously had to put that on the backburner for the week – haha woops! This was a meal from Gervasi Vineyard in Ohio. I love a good wedge salad and miss having such good iceburg lettuce while in India. The other dish is stuffed sausage hot banana peppers. I love spicy things and these were the bomb. Nashville is known for food and these were some of my favorites, but I have a whole post coming on the best food in Nashville! meatloaf, chicken pot pie Now for the Ohio food! Most of which was cooked by my mom. Some of the best dishes she cooked I ate too fast to photograph! My all time favorite lunch is tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. The other pic to the right is called “country fried steak” and is kind of hard to explain, but it’s a Southern dish I think. This delicious sandwich is bologna and it’s not just any bologna, but the best from G&amp;R Tavern in Waldo, Ohio. This was the 5th time I had fried pickles since I’d been back… and it wasn’t the last. The other fried bits are mushrooms. My family and I love fried food and I don’t care if it’s unhealthy :p Dad’s homemade ribs are an all-time favorite and Ben can eat a rack of them by himself. It’s pretty impressive.  We usually get 1 rack for me and my mom and dad, but when Ben comes we get a second one just for him! That’s just one rack above, cut in half. Below, is “sausage gravy biscuits” which is made with delicious sausage grease haha super way to start the morning and my mom’s specialty! Dad’s chili could win contests. We top it with sour cream, cheese, and crackers. I have made this in India but found out the hard way that chili powder here is a hell of a lot more potent! wings, stuffed potatoes, and spinach dip are American appetizers you have to try when you visit the USA! In Ohio, but nowhere else, we have something called Skyline Chili and it’s chili on noodles with a TON of cheese on top. My mom makes it at home, but there is a fast food chain that originated it. Actually, it was a Greek guy who owned it back in the day and the meat sauce is very similar to the taste of a Greek lasagna, Pastitsio. At the restaurant you have to get the coney dogs. We did some Pinterest recipes and some kicked ass, while others were total failures. The little parcels below weren’t the best (biscuits with jalepeno popper dip inside). We tried another similar jalepeno popper dip recipe with crunchies on top and that was so good we had it twice! One I made and one that my BBF’s mom made. The other recipes above? Buffalo chicken dip (the bomb), taco dip, beer and cheeseburger dip (you have to try this one!), and Hawaiian ham and cheese sliders which are all over Pinterest and now I can see why. You will go through a lot of cream cheese and butter making these recipes. Americans love eating dips. It’s a fact. Panera was a must, and my mom’s pizza hoagies (the huge sandwich above on the right) I had to have twice. They are a specialty of Cincinnati and actually the “hoagie” beef is something we have to buy 3 hours South in my parents’ hometown because you can’t get it everywhere in Ohio and bring it home in a cooler when we go South to visit Grandma. Roadhouse salads and rolls… something I crave on the regular fair food: coneys, BBQ, Philly cheesesteak, fair fries, and lemonade… me and my parents went to the State fair which has a lot of activities, but for my dad and I it was only to eat. Ribs &amp; green beans casserole with fried onions Ben’s contribution: shepherd’s pie… my parent’s requested him to make it after they tried it while in India.. it’s the best! mall food… Auntie Annes soft Pretzels and mall Chinese.. the best.. love me some MSG And lastly my birthday cake from Dairy Queen, made with ice cream. So, these are my favorite American foods!"https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-vatican-city/,vatican_city,"Tips on Vatican City Having the security guard tell me, in the pope’s elevator, that the pope was on holiday in the Alps might not have happened if I hadn’t offered a bribe. Seems wrong considering I was in Vatican City , but it was completely unintentional… and totally worth it. My time in Rome started out innocently enough, getting a tour through Rome and learning all about their ancient days. I was feeling very well rounded, smart, and like I was behaving just as a tourist should. The free walking tour we took was full of stories about the Roman’s week long parties where they ate so much, they stuck a feather down their throats and puked it back up. The party could continue! We snuck around the ruins, past the signs saying do not enter (this is very bad, I know…) The mistake. Rome was stressful because Amanda and I were lost most of the time, and because our campground put a random German man in our bungalow (each one fits 3), and he was not fond of clothing or showering. We had plans to leave on a 1 o clock in the afternoon on the train. So in the morning we got up at 7 went to Vatican City and were some of the first in line to go up the Basilica of Saint Peter , just to be told we couldn’t bring our backpacks in. Rookie mistake.  We hung our heads and went back to the train station to lock them up. Upon returning, the line was so long we’d never make it and get back to catch our train. The bribe. I walked up to beg the security man to let us cut everyone; I offered a bribe of 5 Euros . Normally, I wouldn’t think to ask something like this- especially not at the Vatican, but because of our mistake, I was feeling pretty desperate to actually get in. Who knows if I”ll be in Rome again! Not surprisingly, he declined saying absolutely not; it was completely unfair to the people waiting in line. He was annoyed I’d even asked. I thought yeah, he’s right I shouldn’t have asked. Maybe he just changed his mind because he felt bad, but he called out, “Come back, I’ll sneak you in”  as we walked away. Nice!   The reward. We went through a side door so no one saw us cut, and to our amazement he walked right past a red rope of the church lifting it up for us to come in and we went into the back of the cathedral. He hit up on the elevator, and we asked, as if we knew the man, “so what’s the pope been up to?” That’s when we found out where he likes to holiday. When the elevator stopped, we were shooed into the stairwell that winded the rest of the way to the tippy top of the basilica. I love when lucky things like this happen. I was nervous to ask to cut, because it’s wrong, we had been the ones to mess up by poor planning, and most likely I’m told no. In this case, it worked out, and that goes to show it never hurts to ask.  I think sometimes when you travel, the world is happy you want to see it- so it will give a little when you need it to. We ended up not even paying the original fee to gain entrance. We made it in time for our train, and sent a message for him to tell the pope we said Hi!"https://hippie-inheels.com/central-vietnam-itinerary-1-week/,vietnam,"Central Vietnam Itinerary: 1 (One) Week Spending a week in Central Vietnam is easier than you might think. While many priorities Hanoi or Ho Chi Man City, You can escape the comparative crowds and make your holiday in central Vietnam . With the historic Hue, out-of-this-world Phong Nha, modern Danang, and quintessential Hoi An, here’s how you can spend one week around the region. Central Vietnam Itinerary 1 Week Day 1: Arrival Danang and enjoy the seafood Danang is the third largest city in Vietnam, and if you are coming from Southeast Asia, direct flights are available! Whenever you arrive, one thing to do on your first day in Danang is to eat some delicious seafood for cheap! In Danang’s seafood restaurant, you can find the prices on a huge board next to all the seafood themselves. You are unlikely to find English translation, but you can enlist the help of a staff to pick out your desired seafood. The most highly recommended item is their seafood pot, although on my visit we got excited and end up getting full on pawns and clams. Recommend restaurant: Quan B Man B Seafood Address: Lo 13 Durong Hoang Sa – Danang P.S. if you have time, the beaches there are practically empty during the day! Day 2: Marble Mountain and sightsee around Danang before heading to Hue Aside from seafood and the beach, the most famous sight in Danang is the Marble Mountain. The name derives from the five marble mountains that rose high along the flat coastline, and each renamed after the five elements: earth, water, metal, wood, and wind. They are home to some Buddhist and Hindu temples and grottoes, and you can hike up the Water Mountain to get visit the religious sites and get a panoramic view. If you are looking for garden decorations or souvenirs, the marble from the mountains is used for making statue and carving, too. Danang is also famous for street food, too. And their prices are so affordable that it’s insane. You can have fish cake noodles for as little as 1.75 USD, so grab a bit before taking a two-hour journey to Hue. If you want to spend more time in Danang, here’s a 3 days itinerary. Hue is the capital of the last reigning dynasty in Vietnam: the Nguyen. With a few hours left before sunset, set off to Thien Mu Pagoda. It’s best to ask your hotel to get you a taxi driver that would take you there and back because it’s not on a popular road or near the center. Thien Mu Pagoda was built by the Nguyen before they were even emperors and is the tallest religious building in Vietnam. Nearby is the beautiful yet abandoned Temple of Literature, which is worth visiting for photo opportunities if time permits. Practically no one ventures to Temple of Literature, so it’s a perfect photo spot Hue is famous for its spicy beef noodles which you can find anywhere – although as someone who can’t handle hot flavour, I didn’t find it that spicy. It’s a must try for your dinner!   Day 3: Hue to Phong Nha, Phong Nha Cave From Hue it’s a six hour’s journey to Phong Nha, and my advice would be to get a private car or join a bus tour that would stop at interesting sights along the way as you go up. This area was the DMZ – the de-militarization zone – during the Vietnam War, and the history was definitely etched deep. However, the main attraction to Phong Nha is its caves. Phong Nha is home to some of the largest karst caves in the world, and some have been developed to be easily accessible to tourists. For example, Phong Nha Cave is the most popular one, and you can join a boat along the underground river that would take you inside the cave to admire the surreal stalactites and stalagmites.   Day 4: Dark Cave and Paradise Cave Unless you can drive, otherwise it’s advisable to join a tour that would take you to the Dark Cave and the Paradise Cave, since both are in the countryside. For more information, you can find a guide to visiting Phong Nha National Park here. But you can easily find the best deals on the ground. The Paradise Cave is true to its name, a surreal underground world that takes your breath away. Unlike Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave is accessed through staircase down and wooden walkways. There are other more adventurous tours that involve kayaking, as well as other caves in Phong Nha that’s worth visiting. The next destination is the Dark Cave. Unlike the other two, it is an active option that involves ziplining, swimming and walking through small tunnels to get to a dark, muddy cave. It’s a fun experience, so prepare to wear your swimsuits although be warned that the mud does stain. The Dark Cave tour ends with kayaking to its watersports center, where you can use its facilities until the bus goes back. Day 5: transfer back to Hue and visit the Citadel and tombs Take the morning bus back to Hue, it’s time to discover its royal past. The Citadel is dubbed as the smaller version of the Forbidden Palace in Beijing. Despite being damaged during the Vietnam War, there are still enough to see. It was built in the 19 th century after the Nguyen had come to powers, with its own moat and beauty. After seeing the royal residence, it’s time to visit the tombs of emperor passed. The most famous three are the classically Chinese-styled Minh Mang Tomb, the western-mix-Chinese style Dong Khanh Tomb and the tomb where a king had lived: Tu Duc Tomb. For more information on visiting Hue if you have time to spare, check the post here. Tip: you can buy a combination ticket for all 4 attractions! Day 6: Hue to Hoi An Make your way down from Hue to Hoi An via the beautiful Hai Van Pass, a scenic coastal road that’s 21km long that meandered on the mountain. The journey takes about three hours and once you’ve checked in at your hotel, it’s worth reining in the urge to see the old town and visit the Cam Thanh region where the water coconut forest it. They are famous for the round bamboo raft that the locals use to get around, and it’s a fascinating and fun experience to see the waterways onboard one of them. As for dinner, there are no ends of amazing options in Hoi An, but my favourite restaurant there is the Rice Drum. They have all the Hoi An specialties, amazing décor and affordable prices. Address: 75 Nguyen Thai Hoc Minh An, tp Hoi An Day 7: Hoi An The last day should be spend exploring Hoi An’s Old Town. The beauty of the 17 th century port town was preserved in its entirety, with a charming blend of European and Asian architecture style. While the entire Old Town is a work of art, the most notable site is the Japanese Bridge. If the weather gets too hot, the Reaching Out Tea House is a good place to sit and chill. Address:   131 Trần Phú, Sơn Phong, Tp. Hội An, Quảng Nam, Vietnam"https://hippie-inheels.com/two-week-itinerary-for-vietnam/,vietnam,"The Best Two-Week Itinerary for Vietnam (By Someone Who Lived Here Two Years) Vietnam is an amazing country, from top to bottom and from side to side.  It’s endlessly diverse landscapes, food and culture keep even the most distracted of minds occupied. The only downside, if you can call it that, is that there is perhaps too much to see in one trip.  We’re going to share the best two-week itinerary for Vietnam to get you started on planning your trip. Two-Week Itinerary for Vietnam The country is long, a little over 1000 miles to be explored.  Planning such a trip can be daunting, but we’ve got your back.  Having lived in Hanoi, northern Vietnam, for over two years, we know the north pretty well.  So, here we go, two years of travel and exploration of a region condensed into a 2-week itinerary for Vietnam.  Let’s do this. Before going to Vietnam, keep in mind you DO need a visa. You can get your visa quick and easy on iVisa . Don’t forget this step. Hanoi, Vietnam The best way to arrive into northern Vietnam is flying into the capital city of Hanoi.  The city is filled with charm and vibrance at every corner.  There are two rules in Hanoi: expect the unexpected and the only consistency is inconsistency. Suggested time in Hanoi: 3 days (but you’ll be coming and going from the city, too) What to do in Hanoi: Walk around Hoan Kiem Lake This lake is one of the most famous symbols of Hanoi, and its banks are considered sacred to Vietnamese people.  A wander around here is lovely at any time of day, but head over as the sun is setting (and the temperature is dropping) to see people playing badminton, jogging and enjoying coffee on the street with friends. Try to navigate the alleys and lane ways of the Old Quarter Hanoi is famed for its alleyways.  Outside of the Old Quarter these alleyways are where the majority of Hanoians live, inside of the Old Quarter they home markets, street food and shops.  Wander and get lost, stop for a cafe sua da (iced vietnamese coffee) on a little plastic stool and continue on your way. Visit the Ho Chi Minh Complex The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is almost considered a pilgrimage to a lot of Vietnamese people.  Queue to see the embalmed remains of the communist leader and then head next door to see his home in the grounds of the Presidential Palace.  There is also a museum and One Stilt Pagoda on the site. Temple of Literature Not far from the Ho Chi Minh Complex is Vietnam’s first university: The Temple of Literature.  The Temple of Literature is still of great importance amongst local people (particularly students) today.  If you happen to visit around exam period, you’ll see students here studying and paying respect to Confusious, and after exams posing for pictures around the gardens. What to eat in Hanoi: Hanoi is famed for its amazing street food, and it certainly lives up to its reputation. Although a recent “sidewalk ban” has reduced the amount that is actually on the street, you can still pick up a bowl of pho or bun cha for around $1.50.  You can also try Hanoian egg coffee, which is surprisingly awesome!  Unfortunately, the same sidewalk ban has also put an end to the famed beer hoi corner, which was almost considered a rite of passage amongst backpackers in the country.  Head to a beer hoi hall (you’ll see them everywhere) to try a glass of $0.35 fresh beer. Read More: A luxury guide to Hanoi Ha Long Bay, Vietnam Considered to be one of the “New” 7 Wonders of the World, Ha Long Bay is a mystical and beautiful place to visit and spend a night. Suggested time in Ha Long Bay: 2 days, 1 night Most visitors to Ha Long Bay take a tour from Hanoi.  The company will pick you up from your hotel super early and take you by bus to the harbor.  From here you’ll board your boat for the night and set out into the bay.  Most trips include swimming, a beach stop, kayaking and a visit to Surprising Cave. Nights on the boat are pretty chilled.  For those looking to let loose with a bit more party, the 3 day, 2 night Castaway tour is where it’s at: they have a private island filled with activities from rock climbing to kayaking to beach volleyball at the bar to keep you entertained.  And lots of party. Sapa, Vietnam Suggested time in Sapa: 2-3 days The mountainous region of Sapa is breathtaking.  The area is famed for it’s views across rice paddies, hiking and the minority tribe of the H’Mong people.  An easy walk downhill to Cat Cat Village is the easiest option for exploring, and is rewarded with a beautiful waterfall (the walk back up is a little more painful for those that are perhaps not in awesome shape).  For more challenging hikes, H’Mong ladies wander the town offering hiking and homestay trips.  This will get you off the beaten path a little and give you a little insight into the rice wine loving culture of the people here.  And give you a good bit of exercise, too. Ninh Binh, Vietnam This beautiful part of the north is relatively un-trafficked by backpackers aiming to see the entire country in just a few weeks.  And what a shame for them to miss it, but what a treat for those with the time to enjoy it!  The area is known as Ha Long on land, due to it’s lime peaks, and is surrounded by picturesque rice paddies.  Although Tam Coc is the more famous site to visit in Ninh Binh, we’d recommend heading for Trang An, which is an easy cycle away.  The tour will take you through caves and stop off at tranquil pagodas. Read More: getting super cheap flights to Asia Cuc Phuong National Park Suggested time at Cuc Phuong National Park: 2 days About an hour from Ninh Binh is Cuc Phuong National Park which offers some awesome guided tours through dense rainforest.  There is also an Endangered Primates Rescue Centre at the park which can be visited with a guide.  There are also guided night walks, for those that want to get a look at some of the animals.  However, we’d recommend just going for the day and enjoying a cycle of hike through the rainforest before returning to Ninh Binh for the night. Phuong Nha National Park Suggested time in Phuong Nha National Park: 2 days This area has gained in popularity in recent years, due to it being the location of the world’s largest cave.  The area is still very peaceful, and it is easy to get out of the town if you’d prefer to stay somewhere quiet.  Head down to the river for a boat tour into a cave that was used for shelter during the Vietnam/American war, or go on a tour to explore the muddy dark cave. Read more: getting insurance for traveling in Vietnam Vietnam is an amazing country from top to bottom, and it can be challenging to see everything on one trip.  I hope this two-week itinerary for Vietnam has helped give you an idea of what to see and do in the north of the country. The people, culture and traditions change throughout the country, but we have a particularly fond spot in our hearts for the north."https://hippie-inheels.com/top-5-reasons-to-visit-central-vietnam/,vietnam,"Top 5 reasons to visit Central Vietnam and not Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City When people visit Vietnam, they usually do one of the three following things: a) Visit Hanoi b) Visit Ho Chi Minh City and c) Do a motorcycle ride across the entire country. Naturally, when I told people that I’ve been to Vietnam , they assumed that I had done one of the three. Well, actually, people who knew me know that I wouldn’t get on a motorcycle, haha! The truth is there is somewhere better to visit, and here are the reasons to visit Central Vietnam instead. “What is there to do in Central Vietnam?” they’d ask me. The question always disappears when I show them my photos from the trip. From the world’s biggest caves to long stretches of pristine beaches, there are plenty of amazing things to see and do in Central Vietnam, and here are the top 5 reasons why you should visit. PS: You DO need a visa for Vietnam! You can read more about that here or if you are Indian, I have an article about it you can read here . 5 Reasons to Visit Central Vietnam 1. Hoi An: for culture and heritage Okay, so most of you would probably have heard of Hoi An. It is a popular stop for many motorbike adventurists and it’s not hard to see why. With a UNESCO World Heritage Old Town that pretty much hadn’t changed since the 17 th century with its eccentric mix of international influences from its port city days. If you like culture, you can visit the many Chinese Assembly Halls. If you want to try something exciting, you can go on a round bamboo boat along the water coconut forest. If you want to just sit back and enjoy the view, there are no ends of bars and restaurants with happy hours. How can you go wrong with any of that? 2. Get around without night buses If you have hung around backpacking Facebook groups, you would undoubtedly have heard of horror stories about night buses in Vietnam. While it isn’t a frequent occurrence, it still doesn’t inspire confidence nor is it comfortable. As I was traveling with my female friend, both of us decided that we would only take daytime buses, and thankfully it wasn’t hard! It is very easy to find buses from one city to another in Central Vietnam. If you split your time between cities wisely, the longest ride you would have to take is from Hue to Phong Nha, which took 6 hours. Most of these buses are very affordable and included stops along the way. A very pleasant and safe way to get around for those who aren’t keen on motorcycles. 3. The capital of the last dynasty in Vietnam is there! The Vietnam War was only forty-odd years ago, with the two biggest cities Ho Chi Ming City and Hanoi in the center of it. So much so that people often didn’t know that the last dynasty of Vietnam’s capital was in Central Vietnam. Hue might be a city recovering from being abandoned after the Nguyen Dynasty fell, but you can still visit the glorious tombs of Emperors and even their citadel. If you are keen, you can even look around the city to see the French influence – such as the bridge that was built by the architect of the Eiffel Tower. 4. Visit the biggest Karst Caves in the world The beautiful Paradise Cave! While there are new caves being discovered every now and then, for now, the largest caves known to men can be found in Phong Nha, a little town in Central Vietnam. 6 hours north of Hue, the town itself is nothing more than buildings huddled either side of the highways. Prepare to be transported to another world of stalactites, stalagmites. You can be adventurous and go on a 3-day hike to visit the famous Song-Dong Cave or sit back on a boat and visit the Phong Nha Cave through its underground river. There are so many amazing caves in Phong Nha that I can’t cover it as it could easily take up the entire five reasons. You can find a guide to Phong Nha National Park here. 5. Enjoy the beaches in Danang Like seriously, this is how empty the beach is! It is not a well-known fact that Danang is dubbed as the Hawaii of the east. But it’s true. The miles of pristine beaches stretch all the way from the third biggest city in Vietnam to Hoi An, which is a half-hour’s drive away. And the best news is that unlike Hoi An, the beaches in Danang are virtually empty during the day. As the locals try to avoid tanning, they only visit the beach when the sun begins to set, meaning that you can enjoy the beach during the daytime without much interruption. Another great thing is that you can rent a sunbed for 100,000 dong for the entire day. The price is clearly marked on a signboard in front of beaches, so that helps with not feeling like you’d be ripped off. They also have some great, cheap street food – like 2 USD a meal cheap! Here’s how you can spend 3 days in Danang. So, those are 5 reasons to visit Central Vietnam and include it on your backpacking journey of Vietnam!

In this edition, we give you S. Bedford, author of It’s Only the Himalayas and Other Tales of Miscalculation from an Overconfident Backpacker. When my best friend and I set out on a round-the-world trip, I expected what I thought to be the quintessential backpacker experiences. Being awed into humility before the rose gold hue of the Taj Mahal at sunset, for example. Or discovering tranquility in the Popsicle blue waves in Loh Dalam Bay. Or even “finding myself” in that ambiguous sense while gaping at the tremendous mountain-scape surrounding Annapurna Basecamp.       In fact, we spent more time dodging guys with one hand on their camera phones and the other on their trouser crotches than admiring India’s most celebrated tomb, and Koh Phi Phi’s Popsicle blue waves were undulating reminders of the way-too-many cocktails I’d imbibed the night before. As for what happened in the Nepali Himalayas… well, I didn’t so much find myself as I did have my ass handed to me. Here are three of the craziest, most unexpected moments that occurred during my year abroad. Lonely Planet didn’t warn me about any of this… At Taj Mahal WHAT'S COVERED IN THIS GUIDE? 1. Getting Chased by Lions in Zimbabwe 2. Starring in a Bollywood Commercial for Men’s Underwear 3. Battling My 2 Worst Enemies on a Mountaintop like a Japanese Cartoon Character Watch our Latest Video! Important Reminders Related Posts 1. Getting Chased by Lions in Zimbabwe The African jungle teems with an endless succession of fanged and clawed carnivores each more eager than the last to devour your face. There are baboons who’ll throw their poo before going for your eyes; elephants who’ll mash you into pulpy hash-browns; and hippos who’ll… drown you? Squish you? Admittedly, I’m not sure how something resembling a hybrid between a giant pig and an upturned bathtub can be one of the deadliest animals in Africa, but the mystery certainly adds to its formidableness. Africa There was one rule at the hostel outside Victoria Falls: do not leave the compound. I was completely prepared to adhere… until I discovered my bed was full of ants and was forced to bunk with our drunk-on-adrenaline-and-also-beer safari guide. After listening to incredible tales of adventure in the wilderness, I was finally seduced into sneaking out into the screeching, blood-lusting night to fodder my own story. Ten minutes later, I was surrounded by locked eyes and smacking chops, and found myself wondering: If I poo myself, should I throw it?   2. Starring in a Bollywood Commercial for Men’s Underwear Kerala, India I’ve never had the longing to become a famous actor, but I have always wanted to hang with beautiful men, even if they have abdominal lines by Cover Girl and the charming finesse of a durian fruit. Therefore, when I glimpsed a commercial being filmed while sunbathing on Varkala Beach in southern Kerala, I couldn’t resist saying hello to the actors clad in the tightest of whities. But not before I squeezed into my tiniest shorts and most uplifting bikini—hey, I needed something to set myself apart from their female costar, who resembled a sexy deer. Unfortunately, my plan worked a little too well. In addition to catching the eye of the paunch-bellied director who immediately cast me as “cheering white girl number two” (second to my best friend, whose cleavage is way better), I became the object of desire for the one actor who wasn’t also a model. Rather, he was the 40-year-old crispy-haired villain with the determination of Wayne Campbell from Wayne’s World. Anybody know the Hindi translation for, “She will be mine, oh yes, she will be mine”?   3. Battling My 2 Worst Enemies on a Mountaintop like a Japanese Cartoon Character There’s a Gary Larson comic depicting history’s paramount underestimations. It shows the cowboys at Little Big Horn saying, “Indians shmindians” and woolly mammoths saying, “Neanderthals shmeanderthals,” amongst others. Could I add a personal addendum, it’d feature yours truly with the constitution of a shelled mollusk dressed in lumpy jeans and old mittens scoffing at our trekking leader: “Himalayas shimalayas.” (Actually, the line was, “It’s only the Himalayas,” but I digress.) Annapurna Annapurna Basecamp with Dad My two greatest nemeses are cold weather and physical exercise—which you’d think would have dissuaded me from attempting one of the most notorious mountain treks on earth. But I’m also easily lured by notions of achievement (basking in it after the fact, that is, not actually doing it), which is why I undertook the daunting task despite zero training or proper gear. It must be a hereditary trait as my sexagenarian father who breaks a sweat crossing a parking lot accompanied me. Two brain-wrenching, gut-terrorizing, muscle-mincing, heart-rattling weeks later, I understood why the words “only” and “Himalayas” should never share a sentence. Of course, during my travels I likewise had many beautiful experiences that rendered me overwhelmed with gratitude for life—but who wants to read about that? Besides, it’s the awkward, embarrassing, crazy moments and how you handle them that shape you. Spoiler alert: I never did find myself. And thank goodness for that, because then I wouldn’t have a reason to do it all again someday. S.
